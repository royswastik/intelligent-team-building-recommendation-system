Abstract 
Catchwords refer to those popular words 
or phrases in a time period. In this paper, 
we propose a novel approach for 
automatic extraction of Chinese 
catchwords. By analyzing features of 
catchwords, we define three aspects to 
describe Popular Degree of catchwords. 
Then we use curve fitting in Time Series 
Analysis to build Popular Degree Curves 
of the extracted terms. Finally we give a 
formula that can calculate Popular 
Degree values of catchwords and get a 
ranking list of catchword candidates. 
Experiments show that the method is 
effective. 
1 Introduction 
Generally, a catchword is a term which 
represents a hot social phenomenon or an 
important incident, and is paid attention by 
public society within certain time period. On the 
one hand, catchwords represent the mass value 
orientation for a period. On the other hand, they 
have a high timeliness. Currently, there are quiet 
a few ranking and evaluations of catchwords 
every year in various kinds of media. Only in 
year 2005, tens of Chinese organizations 
published their ranking list of Chinese 
catchwords.  
Catchwords contain a great deal of 
information from any particular area, and such 
words truly and vividly reflect changes of our 
lives and our society. By monitoring and analysis 
of catchwords, we can learn the change of public

attention in time. In addition, we may detect the 
potential changes of some linguistic rules, which 
can help establish and adjust state language 
policies. 
Currently, two kinds of approaches are 
adopted to evaluate catchwords. One is by CTR 
(Click-Through Rate) or retrieval times, but the 
limitation is that it is just based on frequency, 
which is only one feature of catchwords. The 
other is by manual evaluation, but it depends on 
their subjective judgment to a large extent. In this 
paper, we propose a novel approach that can 
automatically analyze and extract Chinese 
catchwords. By analyzing sample catchwords 
and finding out their common features, we 
provide a method to evaluate the popular degree. 
After ranking, terms that have high values are 
picked out as catchword candidates.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. 
In Section 2, we discuss about the linguistic basis 
of catchword judgment. In Section 3, we describe 
the extraction method in detail. In Section 4, we 
present the experimental results as well as some 
discussions. Finally, we give the conclusion and 
future work in Section 5. 
2 Linguistic basis 
The popularity of a word or phrase contains two 
factors: time and area, namely how long it lasts 
and how far it spreads. But neither of them have 
definite criterion. 
2.1 Linguistic definition of catchword 
Many researches of catchwords come from pure 
linguistic areas. Wang (1997) proposed that 
catchwords, which include words, phrases, 
sentences or special patterns, are a language form 
in certain times and among certain groups or 
communities. Guo (1999) specified that 
catchwords are popular words, which are widely 
113
used in certain period of time among certain 
groups of people. To sum up, catchwords are a 
language form spreading quickly within certain 
area in certain period of time. 
According to Zipf?s Law (Zipf, 1949), the 
word that has a higher usage frequency is shorter 
than others. Catchwords also follow this 
principle: most catchwords are words and 
phrases instead of sentences and longer language 
units, which are more difficult to extract 
automatically. In the paper, we focus on 
catchwords as words and phrases. 
2.2 Features of catchword 
Some features of catchwords have been proposed, 
but there have been few research to quantify and 
weigh the features. Zhang (1999) proposed a 
method to judge catchwords by weighing 
Circulating Degree of catchwords, which are 
based on Dynamic Circulating Corpus. But the 
corpus construction and the judgment still 
depend on manual efforts. 
By analyzing usage frequency of catchwords, 
we find that being a language phenomenon 
within a period of time, a catchword has two 
features: one is high usage frequency, namely a 
catchword is frequently used in certain period of 
time; the other is timeliness, namely this 
situation will lasts for some time. Our 
quantification method is based on these features. 
3 Extraction Method 
In this section, the extraction method is described 
in detail. After term extraction, the features of 
terms are weighed by time series analysis. The 
algorithm in section 3.4 shows the process to 
extract catchword candidates. 
3.1 Term Extraction 
Catchwords are words or phrases with maximal 
meanings, most of which are multi-character 
words or phrases. Word segmentation has a low 
discrimination for long phrases, while term 
extraction has a better way to extract them. 
Zhang (2006) proposed a new ATE algorithm, 
which is based on the decomposition of prime 
string. The algorithm evaluates the probability of 
a long string to be a term by weighing relation 
degree among sub-strings within the long string. 
The algorithm can raise the precision in 
extracting multi-character words and long 
phrases. In this paper, we use this method to 
extract terms. 
3.2 Popular Degree Curve 
For extracted terms, a time granularity should be 
defined to describe their features. We select 
?day? as the time granularity and get every day?s 
usage frequency for each term in one year. These 
can be described as a time series like below: 
{ }1 2, ,..., ,...,w w w wt wC c c c c= n           (1) 
wC  is the time series of term w.  is the 
usage frequency of term w in the day t. n is the 
number of observation days.  
wtc
As a latent knowledge, two features of 
catchwords mentioned in section 2.2 exist in 
their time series. The effective method to find out 
the latent knowledge in the time series is Time 
Series Analysis, which includes linear analysis 
and nonlinear analysis. As the time series of 
terms belong to nonlinear series, we use 
nonlinear analysis to deal with them. 
After getting usage frequency, we use SMA 
(Simple Moving Average) method to eliminate 
the random fluctuation of series . The 
formula is as follows: 
wC
( )
1
m
w t m j
j
wt
c
c
m
? +
==
?
                   (2) 
wtc  is the smoothed usage frequency of term 
w in the day t and m is the interval. In SMA 
method, a short interval has a little effect, while a 
long one may result in low accuracy. So we 
should specify a proper interval. Through 
experiments we find that an appropriate interval 
is between 10 and 20. Smoothed time series is as 
follows: 
{ }1 2, ,..., ,...,w w w wt wC c c c c= n          (3) 
Smoothed time series of terms can be 
described as curves, in which the coordinate x is 
day t and coordinate y is wtc . Through these 
curves we can see that, catchwords appear in 
certain period of time and its usage frequency 
increases in this period. After reaching the 
highest point, usage frequency of catchwords 
decrease slowly. We call this process Popular 
Degree, which contains three aspects: 
1) Popular Trend: the increasing process of 
usage frequency; the more obviously the popular 
trend changes, the higher the popular degree is. 
2) Peak Value: maximum usage frequency 
within certain period of time; the larger the peak 
value is, the higher the popular degree is. 
114
3) Popular Keeping: the decreasing process of 
usage frequency; the more gently the popular 
keeping changes, the higher the popular degree is. 
Three aspects above determine popular degree 
of catchwords. Figure 1 shows the smoothed 
time series curve of the catchword ???? 2 ?  
evaluated in year 2005: 
 
Figure 1. Smoothed time series curve of 
the catchword ????? 
To the catchword ?????, its Popular Trend 
changes obviously and its Popular Keeping 
changes gently. Meanwhile, its Peak Value is 
relatively higher than those of most catchwords. 
So the catchword ????? has a high Popular 
Degree. 
According to three aspects of Popular Degree, 
smoothed time series curve is separated into two 
parts: one is ascending period, namely Popular 
Trend process; the other is descending period, 
namely Popular Keeping process. We use conic 
fitting to deal with two parts of series. A conic?s 
formula is like below: 
2Y a bt ct= + +                             
According to least square method, a standard 
equation that can deduce three parameters a, b 
and c is as follows:

Assume TS is the starting time, TE is the ending 
time, and TM is the time that time series curve 
reaches the highest point. According to conic 
fitting method we can get curves of ascending 
and descending period. Formulas of two conics 
are as follows:

Variable u and v are usage frequency of a term 
in a day, ( )u?  is the formula of ascending curve, 
and ( )v?  is the formula of descending curve. The 
curve described by equation (4) is called Popular 
Degree Curve. Figure 2 shows the Popular 
Degree Curve of the catchword ?????: 
 Figure 2. Popular Degree Curve of 
the catchword ????? 
3.3 Popular Degree Value 
The decision of catchwords is based on three 
aspects of Popular Degree described in section 
3.2. We propose a formula to calculate Popular 
Degree values of terms. After getting the values, 
a ranking list by inverse order is established. The 
Popular Degree of a catchword is in the direct 
ratio to its place in the ranking list. The formula 
is as follows: 
( ) ( ) ( ) ( )PD w PT w PV w PK w= ? ?        (5) 
PD(w) is the Popular Degree value of the 
catchword w. PT(w) is the Popular Trend value 
of w:

The formula indicates that PT(w) is related to 
changing process of Popular Degree Curve.

The formula indicates that PV(w) is related to the 
maximum usage frequency of w. PK(w) is the

related to changing process of Popular Degree 
Curve. Parameter ?, ? and ? control proportion 
of three aspects in Popular Degree value. 
115
All extracted terms are ranked according to 
their Popular Degree values. Terms that have 
high scores are picked out as catchword 
candidates.

4 Experimental Results and Analysis 
4.1 Text Collection 
In the experiment, we use 136,191 web pages 
crawled from Sina3?s news reports in year 2005 
including six categories: economy, science, 
current affairs, military, sports and entertainment. 
For the experimental purpose, we extract body 
content in every web page by using Noise 
Reducing algorithm (Shianhua Lin & Janming 
Ho, 2002). Totally, the extracted subset includes 
129,328 documents. 
4.2 Experiment settings 
In the experiment, several parameters should be 
settled to perform the catchwords extraction. 
?n  
A large time granularity may result in low 
accuracy for conic fitting. In this paper, we 
select ?day? as the time granularity. 
?m 
For the interval m in formula (2), a proper 
value should be specified to not only 
eliminate random fluctuation but also keep

accuracy of data. In the experiment we find 
that the proper interval is between 10 and 20.  
?TS and TE
Catchwords have a high timeliness, so we 
should specify a time domain. By analysis of 
sample catchwords, we find that popular 
time domain for most of them approximately 
last for not more than 6 months. So we 
specify the time domain is n / 2. Thus the 
relationship among the starting time TS and 
the ending time TE is below: 
2S E
n
T T= ?  
As a proper example, the starting point can 
be 60 days away from the highest point. 
Thus the Popular Trend process and the 
Popular Keeping process both last for nearly 
3 months. So the relationship can be 
described as formulas below: 
4S M
n
T T ? ?= ? ? ?? ?
,  
4E M
n
T T ? ?= + ? ?? ?
                
??, ?, ? 
To keep the Popular Degree values of 
catchwords within [0, 1], three adjusting 
parameters are satisfied to the inequation: 
0 , , 1? ? ?< ? . 
Table 1 shows proper values of parameters as 
schema 1. We also give other schemas, which 
contain different values of parameters, to 
compare with the schema 1. In schema 2 to 
schema 4, default values of parameters are the 
same with schema 1.

4.3 Evaluation Measure 
Currently, there is no unified standard for 
catchword evaluation. In year 2005, NLRMRC 
116
(National Language Resources Monitoring and 
Research Centre, held by MOE of China) had 
published their top 100 Chinese catchwords. We 
use co-occurrence ratio of catchwords for the 
evaluation. The formula of co-occurrence ratio is 
as follows: 
CNr
N
=  
N is the number of ranking catchwords. NC is 
the co-occurrence of catchwords, namely the 
number of catchwords which appear both in our 
approach and NLRMRC in top N. 
4.4 Results 
We use algorithm described in section 3.4 to get 
a ranking list of catchword candidates. 
According to ATE algorithm mentioned in 
section 3.1, we extract 966,532 terms. After 
filtering invalid terms we get 892,184 terms and 
calculate each term?s Popular Degree value. 
Table 2 - 5 shows the co-occurrence ratio with 
schema 1 - 4.

Table 5. Co-occurrence ratio using schema 4 
Table 2 shows the co-occurrence ratio of the 
catchwords extracted by our approach and 
NLRMRC in top N catchwords ranking list. It 
indicates that, when N is 100, co-occurrence of 
the catchwords reaches 66%; when N is lower, 
the ratio is also lower. On the one hand, we can 
see that our approach has a good effect on 
automatically extracting catchwords, closing to 
the result of manual evaluation with the 
increment of N. On the other hand, it proves that 
divergence exists between our approach and 
manual evaluation in high-ranking catchwords. 
Table 3 indicates that, the condition of m = 20 
has a better co-occurrence ratio in contrast with 
others in schema 2. It is because a short interval 
has a little effect, while a long one may result in 
low accuracy in SMA. 
Table 4 indicates that a better performance can 
be made when the proportion of TM - TS and TE - 
TM is close to 1:1. It proves that Popular Trend 
process is just as important as Popular Keeping 
process. Therefore the best time domain of these 
two processes are both n / 4.  
Three parameters can adjust the weights of PD, 
PV and PK in formula (5). Table 5 indicates that 
three factors above are all important for weighing 
a catchword, while ?  is a little more important 
than ? and ?. Therefore, maximum usage 
frequency of a catchword is a little more 
important than two other factors. 
From Table 2 ? 5 we can see that, parameters 
in schema 1 is most appropriate for the 
evaluation.

4.5 Analysis 
In our experiment, Popular Values of some 
catchwords by manual evaluation are lower. By 
analyzing their time series curves, we find that 
usage frequencies of these terms are not high. 
We also find that these catchwords mostly have 
other expressions. Such as the catchword ???
???? 5 ? can be also called ????? 6 ?. 
These two synonyms are treated as one term in 
manual evaluation that corresponds to promote 
usage frequency. However, relationship between 
the two synonyms is not concerned in automatic 
extraction. They are treated as separate terms. So 
the Popular Degree Values of these two 
synonyms are not high either. It proves that parts 
of catchwords by manual evaluation are collected 
and generalized. A catchword should be treated 
not only as a separate word or a phrase, but also 
as a part of a word-cluster, which consist of 
synonymous words or phrases. Through word 
clustering method, we can get an increasing 
quantity of the co-occurrence of catchwords 
between our approach and manual evaluations. 
5 Conclusions 
Being as one aspect of dynamic language 
research, catchwords have a far-reaching 
significance for the development of linguistics. 
The paper proposes an approach that can 
automatically detect and extract catchwords. By 
analyzing evaluated catchwords and finding out 
their common feature called popular degree, the 
paper provides a method of popular degree 
quantification and gives a formula to calculate 
term?s popular degree value. After ranking, terms 
that have high values are picked out as 
catchword candidates. The result can be provided 
as a reference for catchword evaluation. 
Experiments show that automatic catchword 
extraction can promote the precision and 
objectivity, and mostly lighten difficulties and 
workload of evaluation. 
In the experiment, we also find that some 
catchwords are not isolated, but have a strong 
relationship and express the same meaning. In 
the future, we can unite all synonymous 
catchwords to a word cluster and calculate the 
cluster?s popular degree value. Thus we would 
be able to achieve a better performance for 
extraction.
