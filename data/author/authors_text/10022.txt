Abstract
We propose a supervised word sense
disambiguation (WSD) method using
tree-structured conditional random fields
(TCRFs). By applying TCRFs to a
sentence described as a dependency tree
structure, we conduct WSD as a labeling
problem on tree structures. To incorpo-
rate dependencies between word senses,
we introduce a set of features on tree
edges, in combination with coarse-grained
tagsets, and show that these contribute
to an improvement in WSD accuracy.
We also show that the tree-structured
model outperforms the linear-chain model.
Experiments on the SENSEVAL-3 data
set show that our TCRF model performs
comparably with state-of-the-art WSD
systems.
1 Introduction
Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is one of the
fundamental underlying problems in computa-
tional linguistics. The task of WSD is to determine
the appropriate sense for each polysemous word
within a given text.
Traditionally, there are two task settings for
WSD: the lexical sample task, in which only one
targeted word is disambiguated given its context,
and the all-words task, in which all content words
within a text are disambiguated. Whilst most of
the WSD research so far has been toward the lex-
ical sample task, the all-words task has received

relatively less attention, suffering from a serious
knowledge bottleneck problem. Since it is con-
sidered to be a necessary step toward practical ap-
plications, there is an urgent need to improve the
performance of WSD systems that can handle the
all-words task.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
the all-words task based on tree-structured condi-
tional random fields (TCRFs). Our TCRF model
incorporates the inter-word sense dependencies, in
combination with WORDNET hierarchical infor-
mation and a coarse-grained tagset, namely super-
senses, by which we can alleviate the data sparse-
ness problem.
2 Background
2.1 Inter-word sense dependencies
Since the all-words task requires us to disam-
biguate all content words, it seems reasonable to
assume that we could perform better WSD by con-
sidering the sense dependencies among words, and
optimizing word senses over the whole sentence.
Specifically, we base our model on the assumption
that there are strong sense dependencies between a
head word and its dependents in a dependency tree;
therefore, we employ the dependency tree struc-
tures for modeling the sense dependencies.
There have been a few WSD systems that incor-
porate the inter-word sense dependencies (e.g. Mi-
halcea and Faruque (2004)). However, to the ex-
tent of our knowledge, their effectiveness has not
explicitly examined thus far for supervised WSD.
2.2 WORDNET information
Supersense A supersense corresponds to the
lexicographers? file ID in WORDNET, with which
each noun or verb synset is associated. Since
43
they are originally introduced for ease of lexicog-
raphers? work, their classification is fairly gen-
eral, but not too abstract, and is hence expected
to act as good coarse-grained semantic categories.
The numbers of the supersenses are 26 and 15
for nouns and verbs. The effectiveness of the
use of supersenses and other coarse-grained tagsets
for WSD has been recently shown by several re-
searchers (e.g. Kohomban and Lee (2005), Cia-
ramita and Altun (2006), and Mihalcea et al
(2007)).
Sense number A sense number is the number of
a sense of a word in WORDNET. Since senses of a
word are ordered according to frequency, the sense
number can act as a powerful feature for WSD,
which offers a preference for frequent senses, and
especially as a back-off feature, which enables our
model to output the first sense when no other fea-
ture is available for that word.
2.3 Tree-structured CRFs
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are graph-
based probabilistic discriminative models pro-
posed by Lafferty et al (2001).
Tree-structured CRFs (TCRFs) are different
from widely used linear-chain CRFs, in that the
probabilistic variables are organized in a tree struc-
ture rather than in a linear sequence. Therefore, we
can consider them more appropriate for modeling
the semantics of sentences, which cannot be repre-
sented by linear structures.
Although TCRFs have not yet been applied to
WSD, they have already been applied to some NLP
tasks, such as semantic annotation (Tang et al,
2006), proving to be useful in modeling the seman-
tic structure of a text.
Formulation In CRFs, the conditional probabil-
ity of a label set y for an observation sequence x
is calculated by
p(y|x) =
1
Z(x)
exp
[
?
e?E,j

j
f
j
(e,x,y)
+
?
v?V,k
?
k
g
k
(v,x,y)
]
(1)
where E and V are the sets of edges and vertices,
f
j
and g
k
are the feature vectors for an edge and a
vertex, ?
j
and ?
k
are the weight vectors for them,
and Z(x) is the normalization function. For a de-
tailed description of TCRFs, see Tang et al (2006).

3 WSD Model using Tree-structured
CRFs
3.1 Overview
Let us consider the following sentence.
(i) The man destroys confidence in banks.
In the beginning, we parse a given sentence by
using a dependency parser. The left-hand side of
Figure 1 shows the dependency tree for Sentence
(i) in the CoNLL-X dependency format.
Next, we convert the outputted tree into a tree of
content words, as illustrated in the right-hand side
of Figure 1, since our WSD task does not focus on
the disambiguation of function words.
Finally, we conduct WSD as a labeling task on
tree structures, by maximizing the probability of
a tree of word senses, given scores for vertex and
edge features.
3.2 Sense Labels
Using the information in WORDNET, we define
four sense labels for a word: a sense s
1
(v), a synset
s
2
(v), a topmost synset s
3
(v), and a supersense
s
4
(v). A topmost synset s
3
(v) is the superordi-
nate synset at the topmost level in the WORDNET
hierarchy, and note that a supersense s
4
(v) is only
available for nouns and verbs. We incorporate all
these labels together into the vertex and edge fea-
tures described in the following sections.
3.3 Vertex features
Most of the vertex features we use are those used
by Lee and Ng (2002). All these features are com-
bined with each of the four sense labels s
n
(v), and
incorporated as g
k
in Equation (1).

Additionally, we include as a vertex feature the

and the combination of sense bigrams with de-
pendency relation labels (e.g. ?SUB,? ?NMOD?)
and/or removed function words in between (e.g.
?of,? ?in?) are defined as edge features, which cor-
respond to f
j
in Equation (1).
4 Experiment
4.1 Experimental settings
In the experiment, we use as our main evalua-
tion data set the Brown-1 and Brown-2 sections of
SEMCOR. The last files in the five largest cate-
gories in Brown-1 are used for development, and
the rest of Brown-1 and all files in Brown-2 are al-
ternately used for training and testing. We also use
the SENSEVAL-3 English all-words data (Snyder
and Palmer, 2004) for testing, in order to compare
the performance of our model with other systems.
The statistics of the data sets are shown in Table 1.
All sentences are parsed by the Sagae?s depen-
dency parser (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007), and the
TCRF model is trained using Amis (Miyao and
Tsujii, 2002). During the development phase, we
tune the parameter of L
2
regularization for CRFs.
Note that, in all experiments, we try all content
words annotated with WORDNET synsets; there-
fore, the recalls are always equal to the precisions.
4.2 Results
First, we trained and evaluated our models on
SEMCOR. Table 2 shows the overall performance
of our models. BASELINE model is the first sense
baseline. NO-EDGE model uses only the ver-
tex features, while each of the Sn-EDGE models
makes use of the edge features associated with

a sense label s
n
, where n ? {1, 2, 3, 4}. The
ALL-EDGE model incorporates all possible com-
binations of sense labels. The only difference
in the ALL-EDGE? model is that it omits fea-
tures associated with dependency relation labels,
so that we can compare the performance with the
ALL-EDGE?(Linear) model, which is based on the
linear-chain model.
In the experiment, all models with one or more
edge features outperformed both the NO-EDGE
and BASELINE model. The ALL-EDGE model
achieved 75.78% and 77.49% recalls for the two
data sets, with 0.41% and 0.43% improvements
over the NO-EDGE model. By the stratified shuf-
fling test (Cohen, 1995), these differences are
shown to be statistically significant
1
, with the
exception of S3-EDGE model. Also, the tree-
structured model ALL-EDGE? is shown to outper-
form the linear-chain model ALL-EDGE?(Linear)
by 0.13% for both data sets (p = 0.013, 0.006).
Finally, we trained our models on the Brown-1
and Brown-2 sections, and evaluated them on the
SENSEVAL-3 English all-words task data. Table 3
shows the comparison of our model with the state-
of-the-art WSD systems. Considering the differ-
ence in the amount of training data, we can con-
clude that the performance of our TCRF model
is comparable to state-of-the-art WSD systems,
for all systems in Table 3 other than Simil-Prime

utilizes other sense-
annotated data, such as the SENSEVAL data sets
and example sentences in WORDNET.

Although some of the improvements seem marginal, they
are still statistically significant. This is probably because
sense bigram features are rarely active, given the size of the
training corpus, and most of the system outputs are the first
senses. Indeed, 91.3% of the outputs of ALL-EDGE model
are the first senses, for example.
2
Kohomban and Lee (2005) used almost the same train-
ing data as our system, but they utilize the instance weighting
technique and the combination of several classifiers, which
our system does not.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a novel approach for the
all-words WSD based on TCRFs. Our proposals
are twofold: one is to apply tree-structured CRFs
to dependency trees, and the other is to use bigrams
of fine- and coarse-grained senses as edge features.
In our experiment, the sense dependency fea-
tures are shown to improve the WSD accuracy.
Since the combination with coarse-grained tagsets
are also proved to be effective, they can be used to
alleviate the data sparseness problem. Moreover,
we explicitly proved that the tree-structured model
outperforms the linear-chain model, indicating that
dependency trees are more appropriate for repre-
senting semantic dependencies.
Although our model is based on a simple frame-
work, its performance is comparable to state-of-
the-art WSD systems. Since we can use addition-
ally other sense-annotated resources and sophisti-
cated machine learning techniques, our model still
has a great potential for improvement.

Abstract
We propose the first joint model for word segmen-
tation, POS tagging, and dependency parsing for
Chinese. Based on an extension of the incremental
joint model for POS tagging and dependency pars-
ing (Hatori et al, 2011), we propose an efficient
character-based decoding method that can combine
features from state-of-the-art segmentation, POS
tagging, and dependency parsing models. We also
describe our method to align comparable states in
the beam, and how we can combine features of dif-
ferent characteristics in our incremental framework.
In experiments using the Chinese Treebank (CTB),
we show that the accuracies of the three tasks can
be improved significantly over the baseline models,
particularly by 0.6% for POS tagging and 2.4% for
dependency parsing. We also perform comparison
experiments with the partially joint models.
1 Introduction
In processing natural languages that do not include
delimiters (e.g. spaces) between words, word seg-
mentation is the crucial first step that is necessary
to perform virtually all NLP tasks. Furthermore, the
word-level information is often augmented with the
POS tags, which, along with segmentation, form the
basic foundation of statistical NLP.
Because the tasks of word segmentation and POS
tagging have strong interactions, many studies have
been devoted to the task of joint word segmenta-
tion and POS tagging for languages such as Chi-
nese (e.g. Kruengkrai et al (2009)). This is because
some of the segmentation ambiguities cannot be re-
solved without considering the surrounding gram-
matical constructions encoded in a sequence of POS
tags. The joint approach to word segmentation and
POS tagging has been reported to improve word seg-
mentation and POS tagging accuracies by more than
1% in Chinese (Zhang and Clark, 2008). In addition,
some researchers recently proposed a joint approach
to Chinese POS tagging and dependency parsing (Li
et al, 2011; Hatori et al, 2011); particularly, Ha-
tori et al (2011) proposed an incremental approach
to this joint task, and showed that the joint approach
improves the accuracies of these two tasks.
In this context, it is natural to consider further
a question regarding the joint framework: how
strongly do the tasks of word segmentation and de-
pendency parsing interact? In the following Chinese
