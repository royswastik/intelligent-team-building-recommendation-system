Abstract 
Chinese word segmentation and named 
entity recognition (NER) are both important 
tasks in Chinese information processing. 
This paper presents a character-based 
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model 
for such two tasks. In The SIGHAN 
Bakeoff 2007, this model participated in all 
closed tracks for both Chinese NER and 
word segmentation tasks, and turns out to 
perform well. Our system ranks 2nd in the 
closed track on NER of MSRA, and 4th in 
the closed track on word segmentation of 
SXU. 
1 Introduction 
Chinese word segmentation and NER are two of 
the most fundamental problems in Chinese 
information processing and have attracted more 
and more attentions. Many methods have been 
presented, of which, machine learning methods 
have obviously competitive advantage in such 
problems. Maximum Entropy (Ng and Low, 2005) 
and CRFs (Hai Zhao et al 2006, Zhou Junsheng et 
al. 2006) come to good performance in the former 
SIGHAN Bakeoff.  
We consider both tasks as sequence labeling 
problem, and a character-based Conditional 
Random Fields (CRFs) model is applied in this 
Bakeoff. Our system used CRF++ package 
Version 0.49 implemented by Taku Kudo from 
sourceforge1.   
2 System Description 
The system is mainly based on CRFs, while 
different strategies are introduced in word 
segmentation task and NER task.  
2.1 CRFs 
CRFs are undirected graphical models which are 
particularly well suited to sequence labeling tasks, 
such as NER & word segmentation. In these cases, 
CRFs are often referred to as linear chain CRFs.  
CRFs are criminative models, which allow a 
richer feature representation and provide more 
natural modeling.

CRFs define the conditional probability of a 
state sequence given an input sequence as  
 
Where F is a feature function set over its 
arguments, ?k is a learned weight for each feature 
function, and Z is the partition function, which 
ensures that p is appropriately normalized.  
2.2 Word Segmentation Task 
Similar to (Ng and Low, 2005), a Chinese 
character comes into four different tags, as in 
Table 1. 
  
Tag Meaning 
S Character that occurs as a 
single-character word 
B Character that begins a 
multi-character word 
I Character that continues a 
multi-character word 
E Character that ends a 
multi-character word 
Table 1. Word segmentation tag set 
(Ng and Low, 2005) presented feature templates 
as:  
(a) Cn(n = ?2,?1, 0, 1, 2) 
(b) CnCn+1(n = ?2,?1, 0, 1) 
(c) C?1C1 
(d) Pu(C0) 
(e) T(C?2)T(C?1)T(C0)T(C1)T(C2) 
 
In order to find the effect of different features on 
the result, some experiments are conducted on 
these templates, with 90% of the training data 
provided by The SIGHAN Bakeoff 2007 for 
training, leaving 10% for testing. Based on our 
results, some templates are adjusted as follows. 
First, the character-window is reduced to (-1, 0, 
1) in (a).  
Second, feature template (d) is not used. Instead, 
original sentences are split into clauses ended with 
punctuations ???, ???, ???, ???, ??? and ???. 
There are two advantages of this processing: (1) 
the template is simplified but little performance is 
lost; (2) shorter sentences make CRFs training 
quicker.  
Third, template (e) is separate it to three items: 
T(C-1), T(C0) and T(C1), in which five types of 
the characters are considered: N stands for 
numbers, D for dates, E for English letters, S for 
punctuations and C for other characters. Besides, 
this feature template does not always contribute to 
the segmentation result in our experiments, so it 
will be a tradeoff whether to use it or not according 
to experiments.  
Finally, we use the following feature templates: 
(a) Cn(n = ?1, 0, 1) 
(b) CnCn+1(n = ?1, 0) 
(c) C?1C1 
(d) T(Cn) (n = ?1, 0, 1) 
 
We only took part in word segmentation closed 
track, so no additional corpora, dictionary or 
linguistic resources are introduced.  
1.1 NER Task 
Many Chinese NER researches are based on word 
segmentation and even Part-Of-Speech (POS) 
tagging. In fact these steps are not necessary. The 
relationship of them is described in Figure 1.

In closed track of both MSRA and CITYU, a 
character-based CRFs model is used in our system. 
There two reasons as follows: 
First, no word-level information is provided in 
training data of NER tasks in closed track, so it?s 
hard to perform word segmentation with good 
accuracy.  
Second, we had done some experiments on 
Chinese NER, and found that character-based 
method outperformed word segmentation and word 
segmentation + POS, if only character sequence is 
given. Table 2 shows the comparison results.

In our NER system, a Chinese character can be 
labeled as one of four different tags, as in Table 3. 
 
Tag Meaning 
B First character of a NE 
I Character in a NE but neither 
the first nor the last one 
E Last character of a NE except a 
single-character one 
O Character not in a NE 
Table 3. NER tag set 
It?s similar to the standard of The SIGHAN 
Bakeoff 2007 NER track except for an additional 
tag ?E?. Unlike the tag set used in word 
segmentation task, there is no ?S? tag for 
single-character NEs. This kind of entities is 
usually surname of a Chinese person. In this case, 
the tag ?B? will handle it as well.  
There are actually 3 types of NEs in MSRA and 
CITYU corpora: PER, LOC and ORG, so the tag 
set is further divided into 10 sub tags: B-PER, 
I-PER, E-PER, B-LOC, I-LOC, E-LOC, B-ORG, 
I-ORG, E-ORG and O.  
The feature template is similar to the one used in 
word segmentation task except that here a 
character-window of (-2,-1, 0, 1,2) is applied: 
(a) Cn(n = ?2,?1, 0, 1, 2) 
(b) CnCn+1(n = ?2,?1, 0, 1) 
(c) C?1C1 
(d) T(Cn) (n = ?1, 0, 1) 
 
For CRFs, the precision is usually high while 
recall is low. To solve this problem, a set of feature 
templates (only differ in window size, or 
punctuations) are used to train several different 
models, and finally achieve a group of results. 
Merge them as in Table 4 (for the same Chinese 
character string in result A and B).

Table 4. Merge strategy of results 
With a slight loss of precision, an improvement 
is achieved on recall rate.  
In open track of MSRA, an additional 
segmentation system is used on the corpora and 
some NEs are retrieved based on several 
predefined rules. It was merged with closed track 
result to form open track result.  
3 Evaluation Results 
Our word segmentation system is evaluated in 
closed track on all 5 corpora of CITYU, CKIP, 
CTB, NCC and SXU. Table 5 shows our results on 
the best RunID. Columns R, P, and F show the 
recall, precision, and F measure, respectively. 
Column BEST shows best F-measure of all 
participants in the track. 
Our NER system is evaluated in closed track on 
both MSRA and CITYU corpora, and open track 
on MSRA corpora only. Table 6 shows our official 
results on best RunID. Columns R, P, and F show 
the recall, precision, and F measure, respectively. 
Column BEST shows best F-measure of all 
participants in the track. 
 
4 Conclusion 
In this paper, a character-based CRFs model is 
introduced on both word segmentation and NER. 
Experiments are done to form our feature templates, 
and approaches are used to further improve its 
performance on NER. The evaluation results show 
its competitive performance in The SIGHAN 
Bakeoff 2007. We?ll launch more research and 
experiments on feature picking-up methods and 
combination between character-based model and 
other models in the future.
