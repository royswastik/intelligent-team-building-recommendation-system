Abstract
In this paper, we investigate a novel approach 
to correcting grammatical  and lexical  errors 
in texts written by second language authors. 
Contrary to previous approaches which tend 
to use unilingual models of the user's second 
language (L2), this new approach uses a sim-
ple  roundtrip  Machine  Translation  method 
which  leverages  information about  both the 
author?s first (L1) and second languages. We 
compare  the  repair  rate  of  this  roundtrip 
translation approach to that of an existing ap-
proach based on a unilingual L2 model with 
shallow  syntactic  pruning,  on  a  series  of 
preposition choice errors. We find no statisti-
cally significant  difference between the two 
approaches,  but find that a hybrid combina-
tion of both does perform significantly better 
than either one in isolation. Finally, we illus-
trate how the translation approach has the po-
tential  of  repairing  very  complex  errors 
which would be hard to treat without leverag-
ing knowledge of the author's L1.
1 Introduction
In this paper, we investigate a novel approach to 
correcting grammatical  and lexical errors in texts 
written  by  second  language  learners  or  authors. 
Contrary to previous approaches which tend to use 
unilingual  models  of  the  user's  second  language 
(L2), this new approach uses a translation model 
based on both the user's first (L1) and second lan-
guages. It has the advantage of being able to model 
linguistic  interference  phenomena,  that  is,  errors 
which are produced through literal translation from 
the author's first language. Although we apply this 
method in the context of French-as-a-Second-Lan-
guage, its principles are largely independent of lan-
guage, and could also be extended to other classes 
of errors. Note that this is preliminary work which, 
in a first step, focuses on error correction, and ig-
nores for now the preliminary step of error detec-
tion which is left for future research.
This work is of interest to applications in Comput-
er-Assisted-Language-Learning (CALL) and Intel-
ligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), where tutoring ma-
terial  often  consists  of  drills  such  as  fill-in-the-
blanks or multiple-choice-questions. These require 
very little  use  of  a learner's  language production 
capacities, and in order to support richer free-text 
assessment capabilities, ITS systems thus need to 
use  error  detection  and  correction  functionalities 
(Heift and Schulze, 2007).
Editing Aids (EA) are tools which assist a user in 
producing written compositions. They typically use 
rules  for  grammar  checking  as  well  as  lexical 
heuristics to suggest stylistic tips, synonyms or fal-
lacious collocations. Advanced examples  of  such 
64
tools include Antidote1 for French and StyleWriter2 
for English. Text Editors like MS Word and Word 
Perfect  also include grammar  checkers,  but  their 
style checking capabilities tend to be limited. All 
these tools can provide useful assistance to editing 
style,  but  they  were  not  designed  to  assist  with 
many errors found typically in highly non-idiomat-
ic sentences produced by L2 authors.
 
Recent work in the field of error correction, espe-
cially as applied to English in the context of En-
glish as  a  Second Language (ESL),  show an in-
creasing  use  of  corpora  and  language  models. 
These have the advantage of offering a model  of 
correctness based on common usage, independent-
ly of any meta-information on correctness. Corpus-
based approaches  are  also able  to  correct  higher 
level lexical-syntactic errors, such as the choice of 
preposition which is  often semantically governed 
by other parts of the sentence.
The reminder of this paper is organized as follows. 
In  section  2,  we  give  a  detailed  account  of  the 
problem of  preposition  errors  in  a  Second  Lan-
guage Learning (SLL) context. Related work is re-
viewed in section 3 and the algorithmic framework 
is  presented  in  section  4.  An  evaluation  is  dis-
cussed in section 5, and conclusions and directions 
for future research are presented in section 6.
2 The Preposition Problem
Prepositions constitute 14% of all tokens produced 
in most languages (Fort & Guillaume 2007). They 
are  reported as  yielding  among  the  highest  error 
class rates across various languages (Izumi, 2004, 
for Japanese, Granger et al, 2001, for French). In 
their analysis of a small corpus of advanced-inter-
mediate French as a Second Language (FSL) learn-
ers,  Hermet  et  al.  (2008)  found  that  preposition 
choice accounted for 17.2 % of all errors. Preposi-
tions can be seen as a special class of cognates, in 
the sense that the same L1 preposition used in dif-
ferent L1 sentences, could translate to several dif-
ferent L2 prepositions.
  
Automatic error detection/correction methods often 
process prepositions and determiners in the same 
way because they both fall in the class of function-
1 www.druide.com
2 www.stylewriter-usa.com
words. However, one can make the argument that 
preposition errors  deserve a  different  and deeper 
kind of treatment, because they tend to be more se-
mantically motivated (event hough some preposi-
tions governed by verbs draw a purely functional 
relation).  In contrast, determiners are not semanti-
cally motivated  and only vary on the  register  of 
quantity (or genre in some languages). 
For example, there are 37 determiners in French, 
most of which can be used interchangeably without 
significantly affecting the syntax of a sentence, and 
often,  not  even  its  meaning  ("I'll  have  one 
coffee"/"I'll  have  a  coffee"/"I'll  have  some 
coffee"/"I'll have my coffee"/"I'll have coffee" are 
all rather alike). Comparatively, there are 85 sim-
ple prepositions and 222 compounds ones and they 
cannot  be  used  interchangeably  without  signifi-
cantly modifying the sense of an utterance, except 
for cases of synonymy.
In this paper, we focus our attention on preposition 
correction only, as it seems to be a more complex 
problem than determiners.  While in principle the 
methods  described  here  could  handle  determiner 
errors, we feel that our framework, which involves 
parsing in combination with a very large language 
model and Machine Translation, constitutes heav-
ier  machinery than  is  warranted  for  that  simpler 
problem.
There are two major causes of preposition errors in 
a SLL context. The first kind is caused by lexical 
confusion  within  the  second language  itself.  For 
example, a L2 author writing in English may erro-
neously use a location preposition like "at" where 
another location preposition like  "in" would have 
been more appropriate. The second kind involves 
linguistic interference between prepositions in L1 
and prepositions in L2 (Granger et al, 2001). For 
example, a Second Language Learner who wants 
to render the following two English sentences in 
French "I go to Montreal" and "I go to Argentina",  
might use the same French preposition "?" for "to", 
when in fact, French usage dictates that you write 
"? Montr?al?,  and  "en Argentine?. Note  that  the 
situation varies greatly from language to language. 
The same two English sentences rendered in Italian 
and German would in fact employ a same preposi-
tion,  whereas  in  Spanish,  different  prepositions 
would also be required as in French.
65
Studies have found that the majority of errors made 
by L2 authors (especially intermediate to advanced 
ones)  are  caused  by  such  linguistic  interference 
(Wang and Garigliano, 1992, Cowan, 1983, p 109). 
Note that this kind of linguistic interference can of-
ten lead to much more severe and hard to repair er-
rors, as illustrated by the following example, taken 
from an actual SLL corpus. Say a native English 
author wants to render "Police arrived at the scene  
of the crime" into French (her L2). Because she is 
not fluent in French, she translates the last part of 
the sentence to "?  la sc?ne de la crime". This liter-
al translation turns out to be highly unidiomatic in 
French, and should instead be written as  "sur les 
lieux du crime" (which in English, would translate 
literally to "on the location of the crime").
One  might  suspect  that  preposition  errors  of  the 
first  type  would be solvable  using unilingual  L2 
language models,  but  that  the second type  might 
benefit from a language model which also takes L1 
into account. This is the main question investigated 
in this paper. 
3 Related Work
Historically, grammatical error correction has been 
done  through  parsing-based  techniques  such  as 
syntactic  constraint-relaxation  (L'haire  &  Vande-
venter-Feltin,  2003),  or  mal-rules  modeling 
(Schneider and McCoy, 1998). But generating the 
rule-bases needed by these types of approaches in-
volves a lot of manual work, and may still in the 
end be too imprecise to convey information on the 
nature and solution of an error. Recently, more ef-
fort has been put in methods that rely on automati-
cally built language models. Typically, this kind of 
work will focus either on a restricted class of errors 
or on specific domains. Seneff and Lee (2006) pro-
pose  a  two-phased  generation-based  framework 
where  a n-gram model  re-ranked by a stochastic 
context-free-grammar model is used to correct sen-
tence-level errors in the language domain of flight 
reservation.  Brockett  et  al.  (2006)  used a Brown 
noise channel translation model to record patterns 
of  determiner  error  correction  on  a  small  set  of 
mass-nouns,  and  reducing  the  error  spectrum  in 
both class and semantic domain, but adding detec-
tion  capabilities.  Note  that  although  they  use  a 
translation model, it processes only text that is in 
one  language.  More  specifically,  the  system 
learned to "translate" from poorly written English 
into correctly written English.
Chodorow et al (2007) employed a maximum en-
tropy  model  to  estimate  the  probability  of  34 
prepositions  based  on  25  local  context  features 
ranging from words  to  NP/VP chunks.  They use 
lemmatization  as  a  means  of  generalization  and 
trained  their  model  over  7  million  prepositional 
contexts,  achieving results  of  84% precision and 
19% recall in preposition error detection in the best 
of the system's configurations. Gamon et al (2008) 
worked on a  similar  approach using only tagged 
trigram left and right contexts: a model of preposi-
tions uses serves to identify preposition errors and 
the Web provides examples of correct form. They 
evaluate their framework on the task of preposition 
identification and report results ranging from 74 to 
45% precision on a set of 13 prepositions. 
Yi et al (2008) use the Web as corpus and send 
segments of sentences of varying length as bag-of-
constituents  queries  to  retrieve  occurrence  con-
texts. The number of the queried segments is a PoS 
condition of "check-points" sensitive to typical er-
rors  made  by L2 authors.  The contexts  retrieved 
are in turn analyzed for correspondence with the 
original input. The detection and correction meth-
ods differ according to the class of the error. Deter-
miner errors call for distinct detection and correc-
tion  procedures  while  collocation  errors  use  the 
same procedure for both. Determiner errors are dis-
covered by thresholds ratios on search hits statis-
tics,  taking  into  account  probable  ambiguities, 
since multiple forms of determiners can be valid in 
a  single  context.  Collocation  errors  on  the  other 
hand, are assessed only by a threshold on absolute 
counts, that is, a form different from the input au-
tomatically signals an error and provides its correc-
tion.  This  suggests  that  detection  and  correction 
procedures coincide when the error ceases to bear 
on a function word.
Similarly, Hermet et al (2008) use a Web as cor-
pus  based  approach  to  address  the  correction  of 
preposition  errors  in  a  French-as-a-Second-Lan-
guage  (FSL)  context.  Candidate  prepositions  are 
substituted for erroneous ones following a taxono-
my of semantic classes, which produces a set of al-
66
ternate sentences for each error. The main interest 
of their study is the use of a syntax-based sentence 
generalization method to maximize the likelihood 
that  at  least  one  of  the  alternatives  will  have  at 
least one hits on the Web. They achieve accuracy 
of 69% in error repair  (no error detection),  on a 
small set of clauses written by FSL Learners. 
Very little work has been done to actually exploit 
knowledge of a L2 author's first language, in cor-
recting  errors.  Several  authors  (Wang  and 
Garigliano,  1992,   Anderson,  1995,  La  Torre, 
1999, Somers, 2001) have suggested that students 
may learn by analyzing erroneous sentences pro-
duced by a MT system, and reflecting on the prob-
able cause of errors, especially in terms of interfer-
ence between the  two languages.  In  this  context 
however, the MT system is used only to generate 
exercises,  as opposed to helping the student  find 
and correct errors in texts that he produces. 
Although it is not based on an MT model, Wang 
and Garigliano propose an algorithm which uses a 
hand-crafted,  domain-specific,  mixed  L1  and  L2 
grammar, in order to identify L1 interference errors 
in L2 sentences. L2 sentences are parsed with this 
mixed  grammar,  giving priority to  L2 rules,  and 
only employing L1 rules as a last resort. Parts of 
the sentence which required the user of  L1 rules 
are  labeled  as  errors  caused  by  L1  interference. 
The paper does not present an actual evaluation of 
the algorithm. 
Finally, a patent by Dymetman and Isabelle (2005) 
describes  several  ways  in  which  MT technology 
could  be  used  to  correct  L2  errors,  but  to  our 
knowledge,  none of  them has  been implemented 
and evaluated yet.
4 Algorithmic Framework
As discussed in section 2, L2 authoring errors can 
be caused by confusions within the L2 itself, or by 
linguistic interference between L1 and L2. In order 
to account for this duality, we investigate the use 
of two correction strategies, one which is based on 
unilingual models of L2, and one which is based 
on translation models between L1 and L2. 
The first approach, called the  Unilingual strategy, 
is illustrated by the example in Figure 1. It  uses a 
web search engine (Yahoo) as a simple, unilingual 
language  model,  where  the  probability  of  a  L2 
phrase is estimated simply by counting its number 
of occurrences in Web pages of that language. A 
severe limitation of this kind of model is that it can 
only estimate the probability of phrases that appear 
at least once on the Web. In contrast, an N-gram 
model (for example) is able to estimate the proba-
bility of phrases that it has never seen in the train-
ing corpus.  In  order  to  deal  with this  limitation, 
syntactic pruning is therefore applied to the phrase 
before it is sent to the search engine, in order to 
eliminate parts which are not core to the context of 
use of  the  preposition,   thus  increasing the odds 
that the pruned sentence will have at least one oc-
currence on the Web.
This pruning and generalization is done by carry-
ing  out  syntactic  analysis  with  the  Xerox  Incre-
mental Parser for the syntactic analysis (Ref XIP). 
XIP is an error robust, symbolic, dependency pars-
er, which outputs syntactic information at the con-
stituency and dependency levels. Its ability to pro-
duce syntactic analyses in the presence of errors is

particularly  interesting  in  the  context  of  second 
language authoring where the sentences produced 
by the authors can be quite far from grammatical 
correctness. The input sentence is fed to the parser 
as two segments split at error point (in this case, at 
the location of the erroneous preposition). This en-
sures that the parses are correct and not affected at 
dependency  level  by  the  presence  of  error.  The 
syntactic analyses are needed to perform syntactic 
pruning, which is a crucial step in our framework, 
following  Hermet  et.  al  (2008).  Pruning  is  per-
formed by way of chunking heuristics, which are 
controlled  by  grammatical  features,  provided  by 
XIP's  morphological  analysis  (PoS  tagger).  The 
heuristics  are  designed  to  suppress  syntactically 
extraneous  material  in  the  sentence,  such  as  ad-
verbs, some adjectives and some NPs. Adverbs are 
removed in all cases, while adjectives are only re-
moved when they are not in a position to govern a 
Prepositional  Phrase.  NPs are suppressed in con-
trolled cases, based on the verb sub-categorization 
frame, when a PP can be attached directly to the 
preceding verb. In case of ambiguity in the attach-
ment  of the PP,  two versions of the pruned sen-
tence can be produced reflecting two different PP 
attachments.  Lemmatization  of  verbs  is  also car-
ried out in the pruning step.
After pruning, the right and left sides of the sen-
tences are re-assembled with alternate prepositions. 
The replacement  of  prepositions  is  controlled by 
way of semantics. Since prepositions are richer in 
sense than strict function words, they can therefore 
be categorized according to semantics. Saint-Dizier 
(2007)  proposes  such  a  taxonomy,  and  in  our 
framework,  prepositions  have  been  grouped in  7 
non-exclusive categories. Table 1 provides details 
of  this  categorization.  The  input  preposition  is 
mapped  to  all  the  sets  it  belongs  to,  and  corre-
sponding alternates are retrieved as correction can-
didates.  The  6  most  frequent  French  preposition 
are also added automatically to the candidates list. 
The resulting sentences are then sent to the Yahoo 
Search Engine and hits are counted. The number of 
hits returned by each of the queries is used as deci-
sion criteria, and the preposition contained in the 
query with the most hits is selected as the correc-
tion candidate.
While  the above  Unilingual strategy might  work 
for simple cases of L1 interference, one would not 
expect it to work as well  in more complex cases 
where both the preposition and its governing parts 
have been translated too literally. For example, in 
the case of the example from section 2, while the 
Unilingual strategy might be able to effect correc-
tion  ?sur la sc?ne du crime? which is marginally 
better than the original ?? la sc?ne du crime? (12K 
hits versus 1K), it cannot address the root of the 
problem,  that  is,  the  unidiomatic  expression 
?sc?ne  du  crime? which  should  instead  be  ren-
dered as ?lieux du crime? (38K hits). In this partic-
ular case, it is not really an issue because it so hap-
pens that ?sur? is the correct preposition to use for 
both  ?lieux du crime? and  ?sc?ne du crime?, but 
in our experience, that is not always the case. Note 
also  that  the  Unilingual approach  can  only  deal 
with preposition errors (although it would be easy 
enough  to  extend  it  to  other  kinds  of  function 
words),  and  cannot  deal  with  more  semantically 
deep L1 interference.
To address these issues,  we experimented with a 
second  strategy  which  we  will  refer  to  as  the 
Roundtrip  Machine  Translation approach  (or 
Roundtrip MT for short). Note that our approach is 
different from that of Brockett et al (2006), as we 
do  make  use  of  a  truly  multi-lingual  translation 
model.  In  contrast,  Brockett?s  translation  model 
was trained on texts that were written in the same 
language, with the sources being ill-written text in 
the  same  language as  the  properly-formed  target 
texts.  One drawback of our approach however is

that it may require different translation models for 
speakers with different first languages.
There  are  many  ways  in  which  error-correction 
could be carried out using MT techniques. Several 
of these have been described in a patent by Dymet-
man  and Isabelle  (2005),  but  to  our  knowledge, 
none of them have yet been implemented and eval-
uated. In this paper, we use the simplest possible 
implementation of this concept, namely,  we carry 
out a single round-trip translation. Given a poten-
tially erroneous L2 sentence written by a second 
language author, we translate it to the author's L1 
language, and then back to L2. Even with this sim-
ple approach, we often find that errors which were 
present in the original L2 sentence have been re-
paired  in  the  roundtrip  version.  This  may sound 
surprising,  since  one  would  expect  the  roundtrip 
sentence to be worse than the original, on account 
of the "Chinese Whisper" effect. Our current theo-
ry for why this is not the case in practice goes as 
follows. In the course of translating the original L2 
sentence to L1, when the MT system encounters a 
part  that  is  ill-formed,  it  will  tend  to  use  single 
word entries from its phrase table, because longer 
phrases will not have been represented in the well-
formed L2 training data. In other words, the system 
tends to generate a word for word translation of ill-
formed parts,  which mirrors exactly what L2 au-
thors do when they write poorly formed L2 sen-
tences  by  translating  too  literally  from their  L1 
thought. As a result, the L1 sentence produced by 
the MT system is often well formed for that lan-
guage. Subsequently, when the MT system tries to 
translate that well-formed L1 sentence back to L2, 
it  is  therefore able to use longer entries from its 
phrase table, and hence produce a better L2 trans-
lation of that part than what the author originally 
produced.
We use Google Translate as a translation engine 
for matter of simplicity. A drawback of using such 
an online service is that it  is essentially a closed 
box, and we therefore have little control over the 
translation process,  and no access  to  lower  level 
data generated by the system in the course of trans-
lation (e.g. phrase alignments between source and 
target sentences). In particular, this means that we 
can only generate one alternative L2 sentence, and 
have no way of assessing which parts of this single 
alternative have a high probability of being better 
than their  corresponding parts  in  the  original  L2 
sentence written by the author. In other words, we 
have no way of telling which changes are likely to 
be false positives, and which changes are likely to 
be true positives. This is the main reason why we 
focus only on error repair in this preliminary work.
 
The  roundtrip  sentences  generated  with  Google 
Translate often differ significantly from the origi-
nal L2 sentence, and in more ways than just the er-
roneous preposition used by the author. For exam-
ple, the (pruned) clause "avoir du succ?s en le re-
crutement" ("to be successful in recruiting") might 
come back as as "r?ussir ? recruter" ("to succeed 
in recruiting"). Here, the translation is acceptable, 
but the preposition used by the MT system is not 
appropriate for use in the original sentence as writ-
ten  by  the  L2  author.   Conversely,  a  roundtrip 
translation can be ill-formed, yet use a preposition 
which would be correct in the original L2 sentence. 
For example, "regarder ? des films" ("look at some 
movies") might come back as "inspecter des films" 
("inspect some films"). Here, the original meaning 
is somewhat lost, but the system correctly suggest-
ed that there should be no preposition before ?des 
films?. 
Hence,  in  the  context  of  the  Roundtrip  MT ap-
proach, we need two ways of measuring appropri-
ateness  of  the  suggested  corrections  for  given 
clauses.  The  first  approach,  which  we  call  the 
Clause criteria, looks at whether or not the whole 
clause  has  been  restored  to  a  correct  idiomatic 
form (including correct use of preposition) which 
also preserves the meaning intended by the author 
of the original sentence. Hence, according to this 
approach, an MT alternative may be deemed cor-
rect, even if it chooses a preposition which would 
have been incorrect if substituted in the original L2 
sentence as is.  In the second approach, called the 
Prep criteria, we only look at whether the preposi-
tion used by the MT system in the roundtrip trans-
lation, corresponds to the correct preposition to be 
used in the original L2 clause. Hence, with this ap-
proach, an MT alternative may be deemed correct, 
even if the preposition chosen by the MT system is 
actually inappropriate in the context of the generat-
ed  roundtrip  translation,  or,  even  worse,  if  the 
roundtrip modified the clause to a point where it 
actually means something different than what the 
author actually intended.
69
Of course, in the case of the Prep evaluation crite-
ria, having the MT system return a sentence which 
employs the proper preposition to use in the con-
text of the original L2 sentence is not the end of 
the  process.  In  an  error  correction  context,  one 
must also isolate the correct preposition and insert 
it in the appropriate place in the original L2 sen-
tence. This part of the processing chain is not cur-
rently implemented, but would be easy to do, if we 
used an MT system that provided us with the align-
ment information between the source sentence and 
the target sentence generated. The accuracy figures 
which  we  present  in  this  paper  assume  that  this 
mapping has been implemented and that this par-
ticular part of the process can be done with 100% 
accuracy  (a  claim  which,  while  plausible,  still 
needs to be demonstrated in future work).
We also investigate a third strategy called Hybrid, 
which uses the Roundtrip MT approach as a back-
up for cases where the Unilingual approach is un-
able  to  distinguish  between  different  choices  of 
preposition.  The  latter  typically  occurs  when the 
system is not able to sufficiently prune and gener-
alize the phrase, resulting in a situation where all 
pruned variants yield zero hits on the Web, no mat-
ter what preposition is used. One could of course 
also use the  Unilingual approach as a backup for 
the  Roundtrip  MT approach,  but  this  would  be 
harder to implement since the MT system always 
returns  an  answer,  and  our  use  of  the  online 
Google Translate system precludes any attempt to 
estimate the confidence level of that answer.
In conclusion to this section, we use three preposi-
tion  correction  strategies:  Unilingual,  Roundtrip 
MT and  Hybrid, and in the case of the  Roundtrip 
MT approach,  appropriateness  of  the  corrections 
can  be  evaluated  using  two  criteria:  Prep and 
Clause.
5 Evaluation and Results
5.1 Corpus and Evaluation Metric
For  evaluation,  we  extracted  clauses  containing 
preposition  errors  from  a  small  corpus  of  texts 
written by advanced-intermediate French as a Sec-
ond Language (FSL) student in the course of one 
semester.  The  corpus  contained  about  50,  000 
words  and  133  unique  preposition  errors.  While 
relatively  small,  we  believe  this  set  to  be  suffi-
ciently rich to test the approach. Most clauses also 
presented  other  errors,  including  orthographic, 
tense,  agreement,  morphologic  and  auxiliary  er-
rors, of which only the last two affect parsing. The 
clauses were fed as is to the correction algorithms, 
without first fixing the other types of errors. But to 
our surprise, XIP's robust parsing has proven resis-
tant in that it produced enough information to en-
able correct pruning based on chunking informa-
tion, and we report no pruning errors. Chodorow et 
al. (2008) stress the importance of agreement be-
tween  annotators  when  retrieving  or  correcting 
preposition errors. In our case, our policy has been 
to only retain errors reported by both authors of 
this paper, and correction of these errors has raised 
little matter of dispute.
We evaluated the various algorithms in terms of re-
pair rate, that is, the percentage of times that the al-
gorithm proposed an appropriate fix (the absence 
of a suggestion was taken to be an inappropriate 
fix). These figures are reported in Table 2.
5.2 Discussion
ANOVA of the data summarized in Table 2 reveals 
a statistically significant (p < 0.001) effect of the 
algorithm on repair rate. Although  Roundtrip MT 
performed slightly worse than  Unilingual  (66.4% 
versus 68.7%), this difference was not found to be 
statistically  significant.  On  one  hand,  we  found 
that  round-trip  translation  sometimes  result  in 
spectacular restorations of long and clumsy phrases 
caused by complex linguistic interference. Howev-
er, too often the Chinese whispers effect destroyed 
the sense of the original phrase, resulting in inap-
propriate suggestions. This is evidenced by the fact 
that repair rate of the Roundtrip MT approach was 
significantly  lower  (p  <  0.001)  when  using  the 
Algorithm Repair rate (%)
Unilingual 68.7

Clause criteria (44.8%) than when using the  Prep 
criteria (66.4%). It seems that, in the case of prepo-
sition correction,  roundtrip MT is best  used as a 
way to to generate an L2 alternative from which to 
mine  the  correct  preposition.  Indeed,  flawed  as 
they are,  these  distorted  roundtrip  segments  cor-
rected prepositions  errors  in  66.4% of  the  cases. 
However, for a full picture, the approach should be 
tried on more data, and on other classes of errors. 
Particularly,  we  currently  lack  sufficient  data  to 
test the hypothesis that the approach could address 
the correction of more complex literal translations 
by SL Learners.
In the Unilingual approach, the Yahoo Web search 
engine proved to be an insufficient language model 
for   31 cases  out  of  133,  meaning that  even the 
pruned and generalized phrases  got  zero hits,  no 
matter  what  alternative  preposition  was  used.  In 
those cases,  the  Hybrid approach would then at-
tempt  correction  using  MT  Roundtrip approach. 
This turned out to work quite well, since it resulted 
in an overall accuracy of 82.1%. ANOVA on the 
data for  Hybrid and the two pure approaches re-
veals a significant effect (p < 0.001) of the algo-
rithm factor. Individual t-tests between the Hybrid 
approach and each of the two pure approaches also 
reveal  statistically  significant  differences  (p  < 
0.001). The improvements provided by the hybrid 
approach are fairly substantial, and represent rela-
tive gains of 19.5% over the pure  Unilingual ap-
proach, and 23.6% over the pure Roundtrip MT ap-
proach. The  success  of  this  combined  approach 
might  be attributable to the fact that the two ap-
proaches  follow  different  paradigms.  Roundtrip 
MT uses a model  of controlled incorrectness (er-
rors of anglicism) and  Unilingual a model of cor-
rectness (occurrences of correct forms). In this re-
spect,  the  relatively  low  agreement  between  the 
two approaches (65.4%) is not surprising.
6 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper,  we have demonstrated for the first 
time that a bilingual Machine Translation approach 
can be used to good effect to correct errors in texts 
written by Second Language Authors or Learners. 
In the case of preposition error correction we found 
that,  while  the MT approach on its  own did not 
perform significantly better  than a unilingual  ap-
proach,  a  hybrid  combination  of  both  performed 
much  better  than  the  unilingual  approach  alone. 
More work needs to be carried out in order to fully 
evaluate the potential of the MT approach. In par-
ticular, we plan to experiment with this kind of ap-
proach to deal with more complex cases of L1 in-
terference  which  result  in  severely  damaged  L2 
sentences.
In this paper, we compared the bilingual MT ap-
proach to a unilingual baseline which used a rela-
tively simple  Web as  a corpus algorithm,  whose 
accuracy is comparable to that reported in the liter-
ature for a similar preposition correction algorithm 
(Yi et al 2008). Notwithstanding the fact that such 
simple  Web  as  a  corpus  approaches  have  often 
been shown to be competitive with (if not better 
than)  more  complex  algorithms  which  cannot 
leverage the full extent of the web (Halevy et al, 
2009), it would be interesting to compare the bilin-
gual MT approach to more sophisticated unilingual 
algorithms  for  preposition  correction,  many  of 
which are referenced in section 3.
Error detection is another area for future research. 
In this paper, we limited ourselves to error correc-
tion, since it could be solved through a very simple 
round-trip translation, without requiring a detailed 
control of the MT system, or access to lower level 
information generated by the system in the course 
of translation (for example, intermediate hypothe-
ses  with  probabilities  and  alignment  information 
between source and target sentences). In contrast, 
we  believe  that  error  detection  with  an  MT ap-
proach will require this kind of finer control and 
access to the guts of the MT system. We plan to in-
vestigate  this  using  the  PORTAGE  MT  system 
(Ueffing et al, 2007). Essentially, we plan to use 
the  MT  system's  internal  information  to  assign 
confidence  scores  to  various  segments  of  the 
roundtrip translation, and label them as corrections 
if this confidence is above a certain threshold. In 
doing this, we will be following in the footsteps of 
Yi et al (2008) who use the same algorithm for er-
ror detection and error correction. The process of 
detecting  an  error  is  simply  one  of  determining 
whether the system's topmost alternative is differ-
ent  from what  appeared in  the original  sentence, 
and whether the system's confidence in that alter-
native is sufficiently high to take the risk of pre-
senting it to the user as a suggested correction.
