Abstract
We apply the Stat-XFER statistical transfer
machine translation framework to the task of
translating from French and German into En-
glish. We introduce statistical methods within
our framework that allow for the principled
extraction of syntax-based transfer rules from
parallel corpora given word alignments and
constituency parses. Performance is evaluated
on test sets from the 2007 WMT shared task.
1 Introduction
The Carnegie Mellon University statistical trans-
fer (Stat-XFER) framework is a general search-
based and syntax-driven framework for develop-
ing MT systems under a variety of data condi-
tions (Lavie, 2008). At its core is a transfer en-
gine using two language-pair-dependent resources:
a grammar of weighted synchronous context-free
rules (possibly augmented with unification-style fea-
ture constraints), and a probabilistic bilingual lexi-
con of syntax-based word- and phrase-level transla-
tions. The Stat-XFER framework has been used to
develop research MT systems for a number of lan-
guage pairs, including Chinese?English, Hebrew?
English, Urdu?English, and Hindi?English.
In this paper, we describe our use of the frame-
work to create new French?English and German?
English MT systems for the 2008 Workshop on Sta-
tistical Machine Translation shared translation task.
We first describe the acquisition and processing of
resources for each language pair and the roles of
those resources within the Stat-XFER system (Sec-
tion 2); we then report results on common test sets
(Section 3) and share some early analysis and future
directions (Section 4).
2 System Description
Building a new machine translation system under
the Stat-XFER framework involves constructing a
bilingual translation lexicon and a transfer gram-
mar. Over the past six months, we have developed
new methods for extracting syntax-based translation
lexicons and transfer rules fully automatically from
parsed and word-aligned parallel corpora. These
new methods are described in detail by Lavie et
al. (2008). Below, we detail the statistical meth-
ods by which these resources were extracted for our
French?English and German?English systems.
2.1 Lexicon
The bilingual lexicon is automatically extracted
from automatically parsed and word-aligned paral-
lel corpora. To obtain high-quality statistical word
alignments, we run GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003)
in both the source-to-target and target-to-source di-
rections, then combine the resulting alignments with
the Sym2 symmetric alignment heuristic of Ortiz-
Mart??nez et al (2005)1. From this data, we extract a
lexicon of both word-to-word and syntactic phrase-
to-phrase translation equivalents.
The word-level correspondences are extracted di-
rectly from the word alignments: parts of speech for
these lexical entries are obtained from the preter-
1We use Sym2 over more well-known heuristics such as
?grow-diag-final? because Sym2 has been shown to give the
best results for the node-alignment subtask that is part of our
processing chain.

minal nodes of parse trees of the source and target
sentences. If parsers are unavailable for either lan-
guage, we have also experimented with determin-
ing parts of speech with independent taggers such
as TreeTagger (Schmid, 1995). Alternatively, parts
of speech may be projected through the word align-
ments from one language to the other if the infor-
mation is available on at least one side. Syntactic
phrase-level correspondences are extracted from the
parallel data by applying the PFA node alignment
algorithm described by Lavie et al (2008). The
yields of the aligned parse tree nodes are extracted
as constituent-level translation equivalents.
Each entry in the lexicon is assigned a rule score,
r, based on its source-side part of speech cs, source-
side text ws, target-side part of speech ct, and target-
side text wt. The score is a maximum-likelihood es-
timate of the distribution of target-language transla-
tion and source- and target-language parts of speech,
given the source word or phrase.
r = p(wt, ct, cs |ws) (1)
? #(wt, ct, ws, cs)#(ws) + 1
(2)
We employ add-one smoothing in the denominator
of Equation 2 to counteract overestimation in the
case that #(ws) is small. Rule scores provide a way
to promote the more likely translation alternatives
while still retaining a high degree of diversity in the
lexicon. Table 1 shows part of the lexical distribu-
tion for the French (source) word paru.
The result of the statistical word alignment pro-
cess and lexical extraction is a bilingual lexicon con-
taining 1,064,755 entries for French?English and
1,111,510 entries for German?English. Sample lex-
ical entries are shown in Figure 1.
2.2 Grammar
Transfer grammars for our earlier statistical transfer
systems were manually created by in-house experts
of the languages involved and were therefore small.
The Stat-XFER framework has since been extended
with procedures for automatic grammar acquisition
from a parallel corpus, given constituency parses for
source or target data or both. Our French and Ger-
man systems used the context-free grammar rule ex-
traction process described by Lavie et al (2008).
For French, we used 300,000 parallel sentences from
the Europarl training data parsed on the English side
with the Stanford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003)
and on the French side with the Xerox XIP parser
(A??t-Mokhtar et al, 2001). For German, we used
300,000 Europarl sentence pairs parsed with the En-
glish and German versions of the Stanford parser2.
The set of rules extracted from the parsed corpora
was filtered down after scoring to improve system
performance and run time. The final French rule set
was comprised of the 1500 most frequently occur-
ring rules. For German, rules that occurred less than
twice were filtered out, leaving a total of 16,469. In
each system, rule scores were again calculated by
Equation 2, with ws and wt representing the full
right-hand sides of the source and target grammar
rules.
A secondary version of our French system used a
word-level lexicon extracted from the intersection,
rather than the symmetricization, of the GIZA++
alignments in each direction; we hypothesize that
this tends to improve precision at the expense of re-
call. The word-level lexicon was supplemented with
syntax-based phrase-level entries obtained from the
PFA node alignment algorithm. The grammar
contained the 700 highest-frequency and the 500
highest-scoring rules extracted from the parallel
parsed corpus. This version had a total lexicon size
of 2,023,531 entries and a total grammar of 1034
rules after duplicates were removed. Figure 2 shows
2Due to a combination of time constraints and paucity of
computational resources, only a portion of the Europarl parallel
corpus was utilized, and none of the supplementary news com-
mentary training data was integrated.

2.3 Transfer Engine
The Stat-XFER transfer engine runs in a two-stage
process, first applying the grammar and lexicon
to an input sentence, then running a decoder over
the resulting lattice of scored translation pieces.
Scores for each translation piece are based on a
log-linear combination of several features: language
model probability, rule scores, source-given-target
and target-given-source lexical probabilities, parse
fragmentation, and length. For more details, see
Lavie (2008). The use of a German transfer gram-
mar an order of magnitude larger than the corre-
sponding French grammar was made possible due to
a recent optimization made in the engine. When en-
abled, it constrains the search of translation hypothe-
ses to the space of hypotheses whose structure satis-
fies the consituent structure of a source-side parse.
3 Evaluation
We trained our model parameters on a subset of
the provided ?dev2006? development set, optimiz-
ing for case-insensitive IBM-style BLEU (Papineni
et al, 2002) with several iterations of minimum error
rate training on n-best lists. In each iteration?s list,
we also included the lists from previous iterations in
order to maintain a diversity of hypothesis types and
scores. The provided ?test2007? and ?nc-test2007?
data sets, identical with the test data from the 2007
Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation shared
task, were used as internal development tests.
Tables 2, 3, and 4 report scores on these data sets
for our primary French, secondary French, and Ger-
man systems. We report case-insensitive scores for
version 0.6 of METEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007)
with all modules enabled, version 1.04 of IBM-style
BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002), and version 5 of TER
(Snover et al, 2006).

4 Analysis and Conclusions
From the development test results in Section 3, we
note that the Stat-XFER systems? performance cur-
rently lags behind the state-of-the-art scores on the
2007 test data3. This may be in part due to the low
volume of training data used for rule learning. A key
research question in our approach is how to distin-
guish low-frequency correct and useful transfer rules
from ?noisy? rules that are due to parser errors and
incorrect word alignments. We believe that learning
rules from more data will help alleviate this prob-
lem by proportionally increasing the counts of good
rules compared to incorrect ones. We also plan to
study methods for more effective rule set pruning,
regardless of the volume of training data used.
The difference in metric scores between in-
domain and out-of-domain data is partly due to ef-
fects of reference length on the metrics used. De-
tailed output from METEOR and BLEU shows that
the reference translations for the test2007 set are
about 94% as long as the primary French?English
3Top scores on the 2007 test data are approximately 0.60
METEOR, 0.33 BLEU, and 57.6 TER. See Callison-Burch et
al. (2007) for full results.

system?s translations. On this set, our system has
approximately balanced precision (0.62) and recall
(0.66). However, the nc-test2007 references are only
84% as long as our output, a situation that hurts our
system?s precision (0.57) but boosts its recall (0.68).
METEOR, as a metric that favors recall, shows a
negligible increase in score between these two test
sets, while BLEU and TER report significant relative
drops of 17.3% and 7.8%. This behavior appears to
be consistent on the test2007 and nc-test2007 data
sets across systems (Callison-Burch et al, 2007).
