Abstract. This paper suggests a methodology which is aimed to extract the 
terminologically relevant collocations for translation purposes. Our basic idea is 
to use a hybrid method which combines the statistical method and linguistic 
rules. The extraction system used in our work operated at three steps: (1) 
Tokenization and POS tagging of the corpus; (2) Extraction of multi-word units 
using statistical measure; (3) Linguistic filtering to make use of syntactic 
patterns and stop-word list. As a result, hybrid method using linguistic filters 
proved to be a suitable method for selecting terminological collocations, it has 
considerably improved the precision of the extraction which is much higher 
than that of purely statistical method. In our test, hybrid method combining 
?Log-likelihood ratio? and ?linguistic rules? had the best performance in the 
extraction. We believe that terminological collocations and phrases extracted in 
this way, could be used effectively either to supplement existing terminological 
collections or to be used in addition to traditional reference works. 
1   Introduction 
Communication between different individuals and nations is not always easy, 
especially when more than one language is involved. This kind of communication can 
include translation problems, which can be solved by the translators who bridge the 
gap between two different languages.  
Through the past decade, China and Korea have been undergoing large economic, 
cultural exchange, which invariably affects all aspects of communication, particularly 
translation. New international contacts, foreign investments as well as cross-cultural 
communication have caused an enormous increase in the volume of translations 
produced and required. But by now, most of all this translation work has been 
conducted by translators alone, which bears the burden of an enormous translation 
task to them.  
In order to accomplish these tasks with maximum efficiency and quality, a new 
translation method supported by computer technology has been suggested. MAHT, 
also known as computer-assisted translation involves some interaction between 
translator and the computer. It seems to be more suited for the needs of many

organizations which have to handle the translation of the documents.  Computer-
assisted translation systems are based on ?translation memory? and ?terminology 
databases?. With translation memory tools, translators have immediate access to 
previous translations of the text, which they can then accept or modify.   
Terminology management systems also can prove very useful in supporting 
translator?s work [2, 11]. Most translators use some sort of glossary or terminology 
database, especially in the translation of the technical documents or academic 
monograph. Many translation bureaux have the collection of the terminology data 
bases. But time pressure and costs make it difficult to get glossary building task done 
fully manually. Thus there is a pressing need for the tool which is computationally 
supported. For Chinese, other than for English, terminology management tools are not 
so sophisticated that they could provide wide enough coverage to be directly usable 
for the translators.  
We are contemplating, in this article, situations where computational support is 
sought to extract the term candidate, construct or enhance such terminology 
databases. Our work will be more focused on the problem of terminologically relevant 
collocation extraction.  
In order to extract multiword terms from the domain corpus, three main strategies 
have been proposed in the literature. First, linguistic rule-based systems propose to 
extract relevant terms by making use of parts of speech, lexicons, syntax or other 
linguistic structure [2, 4]. This methodology is language dependent rather than 
language independent, and the system requires highly specialized linguistic 
techniques to identify the possible candidate terms. Second, purely statistical systems 
extract discriminating multiword terms from the text corpora by means of association 
measures [5, 6, 7]. As they use plain text corpora and only require the information 
appearing in texts, such systems are highly flexible and extract relevant units 
independently from the domain and the language of the input text. Finally, hybrid 
methodologies define co-occurrences of interest in terms of syntactical patterns and 
statistical regularities [1, 3, 9].  
There is no question that the term extraction work comes into play when the tools 
are parameterized in such a way as to provide as much relevant material (maximizing 
recall and precision), and as little ?noise? as possible.  As seen in the literature, 
neither purely rule-based approach nor statistic based approach could bring an 
encouraging result alone[3, 4]. The main problem is the "noise".  So we need to find a 
combined technique for reducing this ?noise?.  In this paper, we have taken a hybrid 
approach which combines the linguistic rules and statistical method. First, we applied 
a linguistic filter which selects candidates from the corpus. Second, the statistical 
method was used to extract the word class  combinations. And then, the results of 
several experiments were evaluated and compared with each other. 
2   Methodology Overview 
The basic idea in our work is that the extraction tool operates on pre-processed corpus 
which contains the results of tokenizing word and word class annotation (POS-
tagging). Figure1 contains an annotated sentence from one of the Chinese academic 
monograph[18].

And the extraction routine used in our work operated at three steps: 
(1)Tokenization and POS Tagging; (2)Extraction of the candidates from the corpus; 
(3)Linguistic  filtering(making use of syntactic patterns and stop-word list). The 
schema in Figure2 summarizes the three steps of pre-processing and extracting the 
term candidate. The extraction is automatic once the appropriate templates are 
designed.

3   Statistical Method 
Statistical methods in computational linguistics generally share the fundamental 
approach to language viewed as a string of characters, tokens or other units, where 
patterns are discovered on the basis of their recurrence and co-occurrence. 
Accordingly, when we approach the extraction of multi-word terms from a statistical 
point of view, we initially retrieve the word sequences which are not only frequent in 
their occurrence but also collocating each other.  
Before a statistical methodology could be developed, some characteristics of terms 
in Chinese had to be established. In Chinese, the length of terms can vary from single 
word to multi-words(n-gram), with the majority of entries being less than 4-word 
items, usually two word items(bi-gram) (See in 4.3). The number of n-grams with n>4

is very small, and the occurrence of which is also rare. Therefore, the problems of bi-
grams, tri-grams and 4-grams are primarily taken into considerations in our work. 
Now let us consider the correlation between two neighboring words A and B. 
Assuming that these two words are terminologically relevant units, we can intuitively 
expect that they occur more often than random chance. From a statistical point of 
view, this probability can be measured by several statistical methods, such as ?co-
occurrence frequency?, ?Mutual Information?, ?Dice coefficient?, ?Chi-square test?, 
?log-likelihood?, etc[1, 6, 15]. 
Table 1 lists several statistical measures which have been widely used in extracting 
collocations. In table 1: XY represents any two word item? X stands for all words 
except X?  N is the size of corpus? Xf  and XP  are frequency and probability of X 
respectively? XYf  and XYP  are frequency and probability of XY respectively?And 
assuming that two words X and Y are independent of each other, the formulas are 
represented as follows:

For the purposes of this work, we used these five statistics to measure the 
correlation of neighboring words. The statistical criterion of judgments is the value of 
measures which can judge the probability whether they belong to the rigid 
collocations or not. From a statistical point of view, we can say that if the value of 
measure is high, the two word combination is more likely to be a rigid collocation. 
And XY could be accepted as a collocation if its statistical value is larger than a given 
threshold. Those bi-gram candidates with correlation coefficient smaller than a pre-
defined threshold are considered to occur randomly and should be discarded. Others 
are sorted according to their correlation coefficient in descending order.  
Tri-gram and 4-gram candidates were processed in the same way. To compute the 
correlation coefficient of all tri-grams, we just considered a tri-gram as the 
 Extracting Terminologically Relevant Collocations in the Translation 1021 
combination of one bi-gram and one word, and then calculated their correlation 
coefficient. Similarly, a 4-gram was considered either as the combination of a tri-
gram and a word, or the combination of two bi-grams [12].  
As mentioned before, our methodology was tested on pre-processed corpus which 
contained the result of word class annotation. The extraction test was delivered on word 
sequence (POS tags) combinations. And the test corpus was a Chinese academic 
monograph [18]. The size of this corpus is 0.2 million Chinese characters, including 
about 5,000 sentences. In our test, the extraction of multi-word units was based on 
65,663 candidate bi-grams. Among these candidates, when their correlation coefficients 
were higher than a given threshold, they were considered as multi-word unit, and then 
sorted in descending order. The results of experiment are shown in Figure3.

An examination of the results first showed a significant difference in precision. 
Checked by hand, the precisions of Chi-square value and Log-likelihood ratio were 
relatively high. In contrast, the precisions of Mutual information and Dice formula 
were not so ideal.  
Considering the size of the corpus and the terminological richness of the texts, this 
result is not very encouraging. Regardless of any statistical measure, the precision and 
coverage of the extraction are not so high that could be directly used in the application 
system.  
More over, as shown in table 2, the purely statistical system extracts all multi-word 
units regardless of their types, so that we can also find sequences like ???
[zengjia](add)? [le](auxiliary word)?, ??? [butong](different)? [de](auxiliary 
word)?, ??[ye](also)?[shi](be)?, ???[zhuanhuan](change)?[wei](become)?, etc., 
for which we have no use in terminology. Clearly the output must be thoroughly 
filtered before the result can be used in any productive way. 
On the whole, the somewhat disappointing outcome of the statistical method 
provoked us to rethink the methodology and tried to include more linguistic 
information in the extraction of terminology. 
4   Hybrid Method Combining Statistical Method and Linguistic 
Rules 
To improve the precision and recall of the extraction system, it was decided to use 
two criteria determining whether a sequence was terminologically relevant or not. The 
first was to use the frequent syntactic patterns of terms. The idea underlying this 
method is that multi-word terms are constructed according to more or less fixed 
syntactic patterns, and if such patterns are identified for each language, it is possible 
to extract them from a POS tagged corpus. The second was to use a stop-word filter 
that a term can never begin or end in a stop-word. This would filter out things not 
relevant with the domain-specific collocation or term. 
4.1   Syntactic Patterns of Terms in Chinese 
Before a methodology for extracting the terminologically relevant word units could be 
developed, some characteristics of terms in Chinese had to be established. We were 
especially interested in the following: How many words do terms usually have in 
Chinese? What is the structure of multi-word units in terms of syntax and morphology? 
What kind of terms can be successfully retrieved by computational methods?  
To find answers to the above questions, an existing terminology database could be 
used as a sample. Because the source text to be tested in our work is related with 
computational or linguistic domain, we selected the terminology database of 
computational linguistics which was constructed by Peking University. This term 
bank currently contains over 6,500 entries in English and Chinese.  
An analysis of 6,500 term entries in Chinese showed that the length of terms can 
vary from 1 to over 6 words, with the majority of entries being two-word items, 
usually a ?noun+noun? sequence. The second most frequent type is a single-word 
term. As less than 5% of all entries exceed 4 words and single word terms can be

identified with the use of monolingual or bilingual dictionary 1 , we decided that 
automatic extraction should be limited to sequences of 2-4 words.

 Fig. 4. Length of Chinese terms     Fig. 5. Syntactic patterns of two word terms 
As the next step we manually analyzed the syntactic patterns of Chinese terms and 
ordered them according to frequency. These patterns were needed for the second part 
of the experiment, the ?linguistically motivated? filtering. According to the analysis 
of the existing terms, multi-word terms have some kinds of fixed syntactic patterns. In 
many cases, these syntactic patterns are based on the combinations of different two 
word classes, such as ?noun+noun?, ?gerend verb+noun?, ?adjective+noun?, 
?noun+suffix? etc.  We found that there were about 30 syntactic patterns which 
covered almost 95% in the two word combinations. Therefore, we decided that these 
patterns could be used filtering in the extraction. In figure 6, certain types of word 
combinations are more typical for technical vocabulary than for general language.  
More than three word combinations also can be divided into two small parts whose 
syntactic structures are the same as those of two word terms. For example: ?(n+n)+n?, 
?(vn+n)+n?, ?(v+n)+(n+vn)?, ?(a+n)+(vn+n)?, etc. Therefore when we extracted 
three-word or four-word units, we didn?t set another syntactic rule for them. We just 
considered tri-gram as the combination of one bi-gram and one word. Similarly, 4-
gram was considered as the combination of different two bi-grams.  
Although we admit that these syntactic patterns are typical for certain type of 
technical prose only, we don?t think that they could filter out all the irrelevant units. If

  To extract a glossary of terms from a corpus, we must first identify single-word terms. But it 
might be slightly confusing for the computer to identify the single word terms alone. So we 
would like to set aside this problem for the sake of achieving efficiency. But we believe that 
the translator might not be troubled with single terms if he has some kind of dictionary in the 
translation of the source text.

4.2   Stop-Word Filter in Chinese 
When we examine multi word units regardless of their type, we can easily find some 
words which have no use in terminology. These irrelevant or meaningless data is a 
noise for extracting desired data. To resolve this problem, we can make use of the stop 
word list to be filtered. In the system, it would filter out things irrelevant with the 
domain-specific collocation or term. But how can we make the set of stop words? 
Indeed, the stop word list is rather flexible than firmly fixed in their usage. Whenever 
the words are frequent and meaningless in text, they can be stop words in a given task. 
For practical purposes, we used the word frequency data of the large technical 
domain corpora which was constructed by Beijing Language and Cultural University. 
In this data, we randomly selected the 2,000 words most highly frequent in their 
usage. And then we examined whether the frequent words were terminologically 
relevant or not. The analysis of the word data showed that 77.6% were domain 
dependent which could be the part of term, and 22.4% were general words. It means 
that terminologically irrelevant words amounted to about 450 words of the highly 
frequent 2000 words in technical corpora. The results are shown in Table 3.

 These POS patterns are based on the tag sets of Peking University. 
 Extracting Terminologically Relevant Collocations in the Translation 1025 
According to these analyzed data, we made the set of stop words which amounted 
to about 450 words. And we used them for filtering out the frequent, meaningless 
words in a given text before the output can be used in any productive way.  
5   Experiments  
The hybrid methods combining statistical measure and linguistic rules were tested on 
pre-processed corpus. Based on the statistical method, the extraction test was limited 
to the boundary of the frequent syntactic patterns first, and then filtered out by the 
stop word list. Three different statistical measures were used to enhance the precision 
of the extraction, such as Log-likelihood ratio, Chi-square test and Mutual 
information. Because of the poor performance in our first test, Dice formula was not 
used in hybrid method any more. Therefore, we have delivered three different 
experiments using like ?LogL + Liguistic Filter?, ?Chi + Liguistic Filter?, ?MI + 
Liguistic Filter? methods.  
In Figure 7, we present the comparative results of precision rate among these 
different experiments. In order to measure the precision rate of the result, we used the 
grammatical criterion: A multi word n-gram could be considered as accurate result if 
it is grammatically appropriate. By grammatical appropriation, we refer to compound 
noun phrase or compound verb phrase, since with majority of multi-word terms have 
these structures.  
As a result, hybrid method using linguistic filters proved to be a suitable method for 
selecting terminological collocations, and it has considerably improved the precision of 
the extraction. The precision was much higher than that of purely statistical method, 
retrieving appropriate result almost 10%-20% higher than in the first experiment. In 
our test, hybrid method combining ?Log-likelihood ratio? and ?linguistic rules? had the 
best performance in the extraction. The precision was higher than 90%. According to 
their performance, the results of different experiments can be arranged like:

As seen in Table 4, although not all these units would be considered terms in the 
traditional sense of the word, most of them either contain terms or include 
terminologically relevant collocations. Besides, our extraction started from these two 
word items, expanded to extract multi-word units like three word or four word units. 
Finally we could extract multi word units such as the following sample:

Four word units  
????????(MT system design), ????????

(context free grammar), etc.  
On the whole, as we think that the performance of the extraction was quite good, 
this method could be applicable in the translation system.  
 Extracting Terminologically Relevant Collocations in the Translation 1027 
6   Conclusions and Future Work 
The paper presents a methodology for the extraction of terminological collocations 
from academic documents for translation purposes. It shows that statistical methods 
are useful because they can automatically extract all the possible multi word units 
according to the correlation coefficient. But the purely statistical system extracts all 
multi-word units regardless of their types, so that we also find sequences which are 
meaningless in terminology. Clearly the output must be thoroughly filtered before the 
result can be used in any productive way. To improve the precision of the extraction 
system, we decided to use linguistic rules determining whether a sequence was 
terminologically relevant or not.  The frequent syntactic patterns of terminology and 
the stop-word list were used to filter out the irrelevant candidates. As a consequence, 
hybrid method using linguistic filters proved to be a suitable method for selecting 
terminological collocations, and it has considerably improved the precision of the 
extraction. The precision was much higher than that of purely statistical method.  
We believe that terminological collocations and phrases extracted in this way, 
could be used effectively either to supplement existing terminological collections or 
to be used in addition to traditional reference works. 
In future we envisage the development of techniques for the alignment of exact 
translation equivalents of multi-word terms in Chinese and Korean, and one way of 
doing so is by finding correspondences between syntactic patterns in both languages. 
Translation memory systems already store translations in a format similar to a parallel 
corpus, and terminology tools already involve functions such as ?auto-translate? that 
statistically calculate the most probable translation equivalent. By refining these 
functions and making them language specific, we could soon be facing a new 
generation of tools for translators. It remains to be seen, however, whether they can
