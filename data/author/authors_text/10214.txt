Abstract 
 
Handling of human language by computer is a very 
intricate and complex task. In natural languages, 
sentences are usually part of discourse units just as 
words are part of sentences. Anaphora resolution 
plays a significant role in discourse analysis for 
chopping larger discourse units into smaller ones. 
This process is done for the purpose of better 
understanding and making easier the further 
processing of text by computer. 
This paper is focused on the discussion of 
various factors and their optimal order that play an 
important role in personal anaphora resolution in 
Urdu. Algorithms are developed that resolves 
pronominal anaphoric devices with 77-80% 
success rate. 
1 Introduction 
In written text, cohesion occurs when some 
elements in a discourse are dependent on others 
and that refer to items backward in the text, both in 
the spoken or written text (Halliday and Hassan, 
1976). Consider the following example 
 
(1.1) Shah Rukh Khan is off to one of his 
favorite cities- London, with his family. Now 
he is looking for another destination, not so 
much for holidaying though.       
(The News Islamabad: June 2006) 
 
(1.2) Bollywood actress Bipasha Basu has 
been signed for her new film Corporate. She 
is a single working woman, wants to get 
somewhere in life, on her own terms.   
(The News Islamabad: June 2006) 
Cohesion in examples 1.1 and 1.2 is introduced 
due to the terms he, his, her, she and interpretation 
of these references depends upon some preceding 
terms. These referring terms are called anaphors or 
anaphoric devices (ADs). Halliday and Hassan 
described anaphora as ?cohesion which points back 
to some previous items? (Halliday and Hassan, 
1976). The ?pointing back? words or phrases are 
called the anaphors (Halliday and Hassan, 1976) 
and the entities to which these point are called 
antecedents and the procedure of determining the 
antecedents of  anaphors and subsequent 
replacement in some particular discourse is called 
anaphora resolution. According to Halliday and 
Hassan when anaphors are replaced by their 
corresponding antecedents, cohesion no more 
exists. Personal anaphoric devices (ADs) are the 
most widely used variety of ADs in Urdu text. 
These are further classified as first person, second 
person and third person anaphoric devices. 
Examples of first person ADs are ?????? ????? ???
?????  ??????????? ?????? ??? ?????? ?????? ???? 
([m?Iri], [m?Ira], [m??], [m??heI], 
[m??hk??], [h?m], [h?m?r?], [h?m?ri], 
[h?mk??], [h?meI?], [h?m?reI]). Examples of  
second person ADs are???????? ??????? ???? ??? 
??? ????? ????? ?????????????????   ([t?m], 
[t?mh?r?], [t?mh?ri], [t?mk??], [t?mheI?], 
[t?mh?reI], [a:p] [a:pk?], [a:pki], 
[a:pk??]). Examples of third
 
person ADs are  ???
?????? ????? ????? ??? ????? ????? ????? ????? ??? 
????? ([v??h], [?seI], [?sk?], [?ski], 
[?skeI], [?sk??], [?n], [?nki], [?nkeI], 
[?nk?], [?nheI?]). 
 
A lot of work has been done in English for the 
purpose of anaphora resolution and various 
81
 
 
 
 
 
 
            
algorithms have been devised for this     
purpose (Aone and Bennette, 1996; Brenan , 
Friedman and Pollard, 1987; Ge, Hale and 
Charniak, 1998; Grosz, Aravind and Weinstein, 
1995; McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Lappins and 
Leass, 1994; Mitkov, 1998; Soon, Ng and Lim, 
1999). Work has also been done in South Asian 
Languages such as Hindi and Malayalam for the 
purpose of anaphora resolution (Prasad and Strube, 
2000; Sobha, 1998). Prasad and Strube (2000) 
worked on anaphora resolution in Hindi. Their 
approach relies on the discourse salience factors 
and is primarily inspired by the central idea of 
Centering theory (Grosz, Aravind and Weinstein, 
1995). Centering theory has also guided the 
development of pronoun resolution algorithms, 
such as the BFP algorithm (Brenan, Friedman and 
Pollard, 1987) and the S-list algorithm developed 
by Strube (Strube, 1998). Prasad and Strube (2000) 
applied these algorithms to the resolution of 
pronouns in Hindi texts. They showed that the BFP 
algorithm cannot be successfully implemented for 
pronoun resolution in Hindi. They argued that 
better results can be obtained with an algorithm 
that does not use the Centering notions of the 
backward-looking center and the centering 
transitions for the computation of pronominal 
antecedents, such as the S-list algorithm (Prasad 
and Strube, 2000).  Prasad and Strube used well 
established approaches for Hindi anaphora 
resolution. Sobha (1998) used knowledge poor rule 
based approach for reference resolution in Hindi 
and Malayalam languages that stands on very 
limited syntactic information. In Urdu language 
very little work has been done on discourse level 
especially in the field of anaphora resolution. 
Although, most of the anaphoric devices in Urdu 
and Hindi are same but the style and organization 
of discourses are bit different that causes the 
difference in anaphora resolution. Kulsoom et al
worked on Urdu anaphora resolution but it appears 
to be the tip of an iceberg (Kalsoom and Rashida, 
1993). Kulsoom et al(1993) only considered the 
morphological and lexical filters for the resolution 
of anaphora in Urdu discourses. However, these 
filters are not sufficient for Urdu anaphora 
resolution.  
      
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: 
Section-2 describes the factors that play a vital role 
in Urdu anaphora resolution. Section-3 presents 
algorithms, implementation and evaluation for the 
resolution of personal anaphora; this is followed by 
the conclusion. 
2 Factors that play vital role in Urdu 
anaphora resolution 
Factors that can play a very important role in Urdu 
anaphora resolution beside morphological and 
lexical filters are topicalized structures, subject 
preferences, object preferences, repetitions, section 
heading and distance. How these factors are 
helpful in anaphora resolution in English language 
was worked out by Mitkov (Mitkov, 1998), but 
their role in Urdu discourse for the resolution of 
personal pronouns is more cherished. How these 
factors are helpful in the resolution of anaphoric 
devices in Urdu is done by Khan et al(Khan, Ali 
and Aamir, 2006). Ali et alalso worked on these 
factors for the resolution of demonstrative ADs in 
Urdu discourse (Ali, Khan and Aamir, 2007).  
2.1 Morphological and lexical filters 
Consider an example in which anaphora is 
resolved on the basis of morphological filters. 
 
?? ??? ???? ? ??? ?? ???? ?????? ??? ??? ?? ?????? ?  ??????? 
?? ???? ????? ???? ??? ???? ?? ???? ???? ?? ???????? ?? ???? ???  
2?0( ??? ?? ?? ??? ???(  ) ????? ?????-????? ?? ???? ( 
[m?l?khi] [neI] [??reI] [k?] [b?(r)?] [s?] 
[gh?th?] [?:th?y?] [???r] [a:geI] [??l] [di]. 
[f?zl] [dIn] [neI] [a:geI] [bh?(r)] [k?(r) 
[m?l?khi] [k?] [b?z?] [p?k?(r)n?] [??h?] [th?] 
[leIkIn] [n?] [??neI] [kIy??] [v??h] [?nd?(r)] 
[s?k?(r)] [k?(r)] [r?h] [gIy?] [th?].  
Mlukhi took the bundle of grass and moved  ahead. Fazal Din had 
come forward to catch the arm of  Mlukhi, but he did not have the 
courage to do so. 
 
  In Urdu, the word ?? ([v??h])refers to both 
masculine and feminine antecedents. Also, it is 
used for translation of ?that?. Here the 
morphological filters are used for anaphoric 
disambiguation. In the above discourse, terminal of 
sentence is ??? ([th?]) that indicates the third 
person AD ?? refers to singular and masculine NP 
i.e.  ??? ??? ([f?zl][dIn]). In this way, ????? 
([m?l?khi]) will be ruled out to become the 
antecedent. Similarly, consider the example 
 
???? ???? ???? -????? ?? ??? ?? ???? ??? ????? ??? ????? 
? ???? ????-??????( )2?1 (-???? ???? ??? ??? ?? ???? ?? ??(  
[?|nIl?] [x?t] [p?(r)h] [keI]  [?|pneI] [h???] o 
[h?v?s] [kh??] [beIthi]  [k??] [?rseI] [?sk?] 
82
 
 
 
 
 
 
            
[?l??]  [h??ta] [r?h?] [phIr] [v??h]  
[b?ht?(r)] [h??] [g?i]. 
After reading the letter Aneela lost her senses. She was treated for 
sometime and then she got better. 
 
Since the terminal of sentence is ?? 
([g?i]), so it means ?? ([v??h]) refers to 
some feminine antecedent that is ?????  ([?|nIl?]) 
in the above text. The lexical filters are used to 
resolve anaphora on the basis of number and 
gender information. For example 
 
  ????? ???????? ???? " ??????? ?????? ???? ?? ??????? ??
 ???????? ????? ??? ????? ???? ??? ????? ???? ??? ??? ???????
2?2"(-?? ????? ??? ??(  
[l?(r)k??] [neI] [prInsIp?l] [s?hIb] [k??] 
[d?(r)kh???st] [kI] [h?m?reI] [Imti:h?n?t] 
[??ldi] [k?rv?] [dIyeI] [??a:eI?] [t?keI] 
[b?d] [meI?] [pr?j?ct]  [k?(r)neI]  [KeIlIyeI] 
[h?m?reI] [p?s] [zIy?d?] [seI] [zIy?da] [v?kt] 
[h??]. 
Students submitted application to the  Principal ?our exams should be 
arranged  earlier so that we will have maximum time for our project? 
 
In 2.2, following the number information, the 
antecedent for  ?????  ([h?m?reI]) will be ?????  
([l?(r)k??]). So, the remaining candidate  ??????
???? ([prInsIp?l] [s?hIb]) is ruled out on 
the basis of number mismatch. 
Here is another example in which antecedents 
for third person anaphoric devices are found on the 
basis of morphological and lexical filters. In the 
following discourse, antecedent for third person 
AD ?? ([v??h]) is singular, feminine noun 
phrase ?? ??? ??  [f?z?l] [bIbI]) since the 
terminal of sentence is ????? ?? ([??hti] 
[h?]). 
 
?? ??? ?? ?? ?? ?????? ?? ?????  ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ???????? 
??  ??? ?? ???? ??-????? ?? ??? ????? ?? ?? ??? ????? ????? ??
??  ?????? ??? ???? ???? ??? ??? ???? ??? ???? ?????? ??
2?3(   -????? ?? ????? ?? ??????? ?? ???? ?? ??(  
)????? ?????-?????? (  
[f?z?l] [bIbI] [neI] [??b] [y?h] [f?sl?] 
[k?(r)] [lIy?] [t??] [?s] [neI] [x?nd?n] [keI] 
[d??s?reI] [?fr?d] [k??] [bhi] [b?t?y?] [k?h] 
[v??h] [p?(r)hn?]  [??hti] [h?]. [y??] [t??] 
[s?reI] [g???] [v?leI] [?ski] [b?h?t] [Iz?t] 
[k?(r)teI] [theI] [l?kIn] [Is] [m??m?leI] 
[meI?] [?sk??] [?ski] [b??Iy??] [keI] [h?v?leI] 
[seI] [s?m??neI] [ki] [k???I?] [ki] [g?i].    
When Fazal Bibi decided she informed other family members that she 
also wants to  study. Although, she was respectable for the whole 
village but in this matter she was advised keeping in view her 
daughters. 
 
2.2 Topicalized structures 
In Urdu, topicalized structures are more frequently 
used. Consider the example 
 
??? ???  ??? ????? ???? ?? ???? ??? ! ? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ??? ?? 
??? ???- ) 42?(  
[kh?(r)] [s?hIb]! [m?i] [f?d?l] [l?rd] [??b] 
[m?nz?(r)] [?m] [p?(r)] [a:i] [t??] [a:p] [k?]  
[r?deI] [?ml] [kIy?] [th?]. 
Mr. Kher! When the  book  ?My Feudal? Lord came into the market, 
what was your reaction. 
 
?????? ????? ?? ??? ????? ??????? ??? ?? ?? ???? ?? ???? ! ?????
???? ?????? ??? ???? ??? ?? ??? ? ??? ???  -??? ???? ???
? ???? ????-??????()2?5( -?? ?????? ?????? ?? ??(  
[f?tIm?]! [t?mh?ri] [y?d???] [k?]  [kIy?] 
[k?(r)??]? [gh??s?leI] [b?t]  [?r] [k?(r)] 
[k?hi:?] [n?] [k?hi:?] [??leI] [??teI] [h??] 
[leIki:n]  [t?mh?reI] [a:t?] [k?(r)d?] [b?t] 
[t??]  [s?bh] o   [??m] [x?neI] [?Ig?(r)] [k?]  
[???g?] [m??gteI] [h??] 
Fatima! What should I do with your memories?  Every thing vanishes 
with the passage of time but your memories are like unripe grain 
which needs my blood to flourish. 
 
In 2.4, the word ?? ([a:p]) refers to 
topicalized structure ???? ??? ([kh?(r)] 
[s?hIb]). Similarly, in discourse 2.5 ADs 
?????? ([t?mh?ri])and?????? ([t?mh?reI]) 
refer to ?????  ([f?tIm?]).  It must be noted that 
whenever topicalized structures appear in the Urdu 
discourses these become preferred antecedents for 
second person anaphoric devices. 
2.3  Count of occurrences 
It can be the case that in a particular discourse if a 
certain NP appears more frequently then it will be 
the potential antecedent  for pronouns appearing in 
that text. For example, consider the following 
discourse 
 
???? ??? ??? ??????? -???? ?? ???? ???? ??? ? ???? ?? ?????? ???
???? ???-    ???? ?? ????? ???? ?? ?? ???? ??? ??? ????? ??
?? ??? ???? ????????? ??? ???? ???? ???? ????  ????? ????-   ????
? ?? ??? ?????? ?? ????? ?? ?????? ??  ??? ???  ??  ????? 
 ?? ?????? ?  ????? - )62?(  
)???? ????-????? ??? ???? ?? ????? (  
[m?nt?] [seI]   [?xf?] [b?(r)t?]  [gIy?]. [Iski] 
[k?i] [v???h?t]  [h??]. [m?ntu:] [?k]  [gheIr] 
[??nIbd?r] [?|di:b] [th?]  [m?nt?] [keI] 
[m?a:sIr]    [?|di:b]  [?skeI] [r?vIyeI] [???r] 
[teIz] [k?l?mi]  [seI] [n?l??] [theI].  [kh?l?m] 
[kh?l?] [??r?b] [n???i] [ki] [v??h?] [seI] 
[v??h] [n?p?s?ndId?] [th?]. [m?nt?] [p?(r)] 
[p?] [d?(r)] [p?] [f?h??i] [keI] [mu:k?dm?t] 
83
 
 
 
 
 
 
            
[neI] [?seI] [s?k?]  [l??g??n] [ki] [n?z?(r)]  
[meI?]  [m?l?:n] [b?n?] [dIy?] [th?]. 
Anger was shown to Muntoo. It has several reasons. Muntoo was an 
un-biased writer. Due to his aggressive attitude, his fellows were 
always angry with him. He was not liked because he used to drink 
openly. Due to continuous court cases regarding obscenity, he was not 
liked by gentlemen community. 
 
Here the proper noun ???? ([m?nt?]) 
appears repeatedly. So, on the basis of repetition, it 
will be the potential antecedent for most of 
personal pronouns e.g. ?? ([v??h]),???  
([?seI])and ????  ([?skeI]) appearing in the 
above text.  
 
2.4  Section headings 
Section headings get high preference to become 
antecedents for most of personal pronouns in Urdu 
discourses. Consider the following example 
 
???? ????  
??? ????? ?? ??? ??? ?? ???? ????? ???? ???? ???? ???? ?? ??
?? ???? ????? ??? -???? ?? ???? ??????????? ?? ???? ???? ?? ? 
??   -??? ?? ???? ???? ???? ????? ???? ?? ?? ?? ?????? ??? ????
????? ??? ??????? ?? ??? ? ??????? ??? ???? ?????? ??? 
????  -???? ???? ???? ?? ?? ?? ?? ???? ?? ??? ???? ????? ??? 
?????    (")2?7( -???? ????? ????? ????? ????? ???? ???
2006 ??? -"??????(  
[???b] [?xt?(r)] 
[???b] [?xt?(r)] [krIkIt] [b??rd] [keIlIyeI] 
[v??h] [an??kh?][l?dl?] [b?n] [??keI] [h??] [???] 
[geInd]  [b?t] [seI] [kheIlneI] [ki] [b???I]  
[??nd] [ki] [t?m?nn?] [k?(r)teI] [h??]. [v??h] 
[v?hid] [b??l?(r)] [h??] [?Inh???] [neI] [Itni] 
[kIrk?t] [n?hI?] [kheIli]  [?itna:] [?nfIt] 
[h??] [keI]  [a:r?m] [kIy?] [h?]. [v??h] 
[???hr?t]  [???r]   [m?kb?lI?t] [keI] [lIh?z] [seI]  
[nIh?y?t]  [x??] [kIsm?t] [khIl?ri] [h??]  
[?Iski] [v?hId] [kh?bi]   [y?h]  [h?] [k?h] 
[v??h] [d?ny?] [keI]  [teIz] [t?ri:n] [b??l?(r)] 
[h??].  [?IskeI] [n?khreI] [Imr?n] [seI]  [bhi] 
[zIy?d?] [?th?eI] [j?teI]  [h??]. 
Shoaib Akhter 
Shoaib Akhter has become a burden over the cricket board. He is the 
only bowler in Pakistani cricket team who has not played much 
cricket rather always took rest because of being unfit. He is lucky to 
become popular only because he is the fastest bowler in the world. He 
is given more importance even compared to Imran.  
 
In the above discourse, ???? ???? ([???b] 
[?xt?(r)])is section heading, so it will be the 
preferred antecedent for most of anaphoric devices 
appearing in the discourse and all other NPs will 
be ruled out to become the potential antecedents. 
 
 
2.5  Distance 
 Distance plays an important role in finding the 
antecedents. For each anaphoric device such as   
??? ???? ????? ? ?? ? ??? ???  ???? ??? ? ???? ([?s], 
[?seI], [?sk??] [?sk?] [?ski]  [?n], 
[?nk?], [?nki]), preference is given to the 
nearest object present in the same or immediate 
previous sentence. Consider following discourse 
 
????? ??? ??? ??? ???? ?? ???? ???? ?? ???? ???? ????? ?? 
 ??? ?? ???? ??????? ?? ???? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??????? ??
?? ? ???  ??????? ?? ?????-????? ?? ???? ?????? ?? ??? ???

A little after the sun rise, when they reached the lake Anwer Ali 
ordered his colleagues to stop and laid Legrand on the ground taking 
him from horseback. Some soldiers took the dried bread from bags 
and distributed them among other soldiers and sat on the bank of the 
lake. One friend of Anwer Ali had the experience of surgery. He asked 
Anwer Ali after inspecting the wounds of Legrand, ? if you  permit me 
, I can do the surgery after taking out the bullet from his body?. The 
friend further added, ?Had his fever not this much the job would have 
been easier?. 
 
In discourse 2.8, the preferred antecedents for 
?? ?? ([?sneI]) are lying in the same or in the 
immediate previous sentence.  Similarly, in (2.3),   
the   antecedents     for    third     person    ADs     
 ??? ???? ????? ??????  ([?sneI], [?seI], 
[?sk??], [?ski]) are resolved on the basis of 
distance. 
84
 
 
 
 
 
 
            
 
2.6  Subject and object preference 
In Urdu, especially for the resolution of personal 
ADs (first person, second person and third person), 
subject and object preference plays a very 
important role.  Consider the example 
 
 ??? ???? ???? ??? ?????? ??? ???? ??? ???? ?? ????? ?????
???? ??? ????? ?????? ??? ???? ?? ????? ?????? ?? ?????? "?
 ????? ??? ??? ???? ??????? ??? ????? ??? ?? ???? ?? ???? ??
 ?? ???? ???? ??? ????? ?? ???? ?? ?? ?? ???? ??? ??? ???

Anwer Ali started reading the letter. Murad Ali had written ?my 
brother! Regards, I have gone  for the inspection of defense posts.  
Therefore, I was unable to send reply to yours and your Mrs. letters. I 
have got leave for one month. However, before coming home I want to 
visit  uncle Akber Khan?  
 
Discourse 2.9, consists of frequent use of first 
person anaphoric devices ????? ??? ([mu:?heI], 
[m??]).  Discourse 2.9  is in the form of direct 
speech. In such type of discourse, for resolution of 
first person anaphoric devices highest, preference 
will be given to subject of the main clause i.e. the 
clause just before the reported speech starts.  ????
??? ([m?r?d] [?li]) is the subject of  the main 
clause so all first person anaphoric devices will 
refer to   ???? ??? ([m?r?d] [?li]). Similarly, in 
case of second person anaphoric devices, object 
preference will be the highest.

Again, 2.10, 2.11  and 2.12 are in the form of 
direct speech. In all above discourses, second 
person ADs ??? ??? ????? ?????? ??????? ?????? ?? 
([t?m], [t?], [t?mk??], [t?mh??],  
[t?mh?r?], [t?mh?ri],[a:p]) have direct

Lord Kernevalis was aware of the preparations of Tipu Sultan about 
the final war. He knew that it will be quite dangerous to lengthen the 
war and he was worried to think about the results of the war. 
 
  Here, terminals of the sentence are  ???? ????    
([l?gt?], [th?]) that are used for personal  
singular and masculine NP, but the problem is that 
???? ? ???? ???????? ([l?rd] [k?rnIv?lIs], 
([tIp?]) both are personal, singular and 
masculine NPs. So the question arises that ??  
([v??h]) refers to which NP in the preceding 
85
 
 
 
 
 
 
            
sentence. Here, the subject preference will be high. 
So, ?? ([v??h]) refers to   ???? ????????. 
2.7  NP followed by certain words 
Certain NPs in Urdu discourse are followed by 
words ???????? ??????? ?? ??? 
([keI][m?tal?k]], [keI][bareI], [kI] 
[t?(r)f]). In such circumstances, these NPs will 
be given highest priority to become the 
antecedents. For example,

3  Implementations and evaluations 
An informal algorithm for the resolution of first 
person anaphoric devices is as follows: 
 
1. Examine the next clause in the discourse. If no 
clause exists then finish. 
2. If the current clause consists of first person 
anaphoric devices then go to step-3 else go to 
step-1. 
3. Access the previous clause. 
4. If the current clause consists of section 
headings, noun phrase followed by certain 
words then assign weight to these filters else 
assign priority to noun or noun phrase 
appearing as a subject of the clause. 
5. If no subject exists then go to step-3. 
Similarly, an informal algorithm for the 
resolution of second person ADs is as follows: 
 
1. Examine the next clause in the discourse. If no 
clause exists then finish. 
2. If the current clause consists of second person 
anaphoric devices then go to step-3 else go to 
step-1. 
3. Access the previous clause. 
4. If the current clause consists of topicalized 
structures then assign weight to these filters 
else assign priority to noun or noun phrase 
appearing as an object of the clause. 
5. If no object exists then go to step-3. 
 
In the same way an informal algorithm for the 
resolution of third person ADs is as follows: 
 
1. Examine the next clause in the discourse and if 
no clause exists then go to step-9. 
2. If the current clause consists of third person 
anaphoric devices then go to step-3 else go to 
step 1. 
3. Access the previous clause. 
4. Apply the lexical and morphological filters to 
assign the weight to nouns or noun phrases that 
follow the morphological and lexical filters. 
5. If current clause consists of section headings or 
topicalized structures or noun phrase            
preceded / followed by certain class of words 
then assign the weight of these filters. 
6. If current clause consists of   noun or noun 
phrase as subject and objects (direct, indirect) 
then assign the weight value for these filters. 
7. If the current clause does not consists noun or 
noun phrase as subject, object or contains no 
section headings, topicalized structures and 
noun phrase preceded by certain words then go 
to step- 3.  
8. Find the repetitions of all noun or noun phrases 
and increment their corresponding weights for 
each repetition. 
9. Record the results and Finish  
 
Algorithms are implemented in Visual C++. 
Implemented algorithm gets the input that is 
constructed manually.  For this purpose each 
discourse is divided into clauses and is stored as 
Unicode text file for input to anaphora resolution

program. For better understanding, consider the 
example of discourse 2.8 and its division into 
clauses. 
 
clause(sub( ????? ?? ,sng,msc),dob( ??????? ,plu,msc),vb(sng,msc)). 
clause(sub(??),dob( ??????? ,sng,msc),vb(sng,msc)). 
clause(sub( ??????? ,plu,msc),dob( ?????? ,fem,plu),vb(plu,msc)). 
clause(sub(nill),dob( ??????? ,plu,msc),vb(plu,msc)). 
clause(sub(??),dob( ???? ,sng,fem), vb(plu,msc)). 
clause(sub(( ????? ,sng,msc),dob(?????,sng,msc),vb(sng,msc)). 
clause(sub(??),dob( ??????? ,sng,msc),vb(sng,msc)). 
clause(sub( ????? ,sng,msc),dob( ????? ?? ,msc,sng),vb(sgn,msc)). 
clause(sub(??),dob(nill),vb(plu,msc)). 
clause(sub( ??? ),dob(???,msc,sng),vb(sng,msc)). 
clause(sub(??),dob( ??????? ,sng,msc),vb(sng,msc)). 
clause(sub(????),dob(????,msc,sng),vb(sng,msc)). 
clause(sub(nill),dob( ???? ),vb(sng,msc)). 
Fig 1 
 
Table-1, Table-2 and Table-3 show the order 
of weights assigned to various filters for the 
resolution of first person, second person and third 
person anaphoric devices. The implemented 
algorithm aims to determine the efficiency in terms 
of accuracy and reliability of the proposed order of 
factors. For this purpose various experiments were 
conducted over various text genres. To evaluate the 
success rate of every experiment, precision is 
calculated as defined below.  The average length of 
each discourse in sentences was 4-6.   
 
Precision =   Number of correctly resolved anaphors  /  Number of anaphors  
                                                                                   attempted to be resolved    
 
 
The results of the three experiments are as 
follows 
 
Experiment#  Precision 
1            78% 
2         80% 
3        80% 
 
Table-1 shows that in case of first person 
anaphoric devices the priority has been assigned on 
the basis of section heading, noun phrase followed 
by certain words and then subject. It means that if 
no section heading or noun phrase followed by 
certain words are present then the subject in the 
main or previous clause will be the potential 
antecedent for first person anaphoric devices. 
Similarly, Table-2 for second person anaphoric 
devices, exhibits that weights will be assigned in 
descending order (left ? right). It means that the 
leftmost filter that is topicalized structure will get 
the highest weight for second person ADs. 
Consider the following output (Fig-2) produced by 
anaphora resolution program, for the resolution of 
second person anaphoric device ???? in the 
discourse 2.4, topicalized structure ??? ???? gets 
high priority to become the antecedent. 
 
Clause     1, SUB ( ???? )  RESTO   (  )  2 ??? ????
Fig 2 
 
Again, in case of third person anaphoric 
devices weights as shown in Table-3 have been 
assigned in descending order (top - bottom). It 
means the weight of section heading filter will be 
larger in value than that of subject filter. Consider 
a noun or noun phrase which is section heading as 
well as a repeated noun and also lexical filter 
applies on it. For this noun or noun phrase all the 
weights will be summed up. A noun with highest 
weight will be given preference to become the 
antecedent for third person anaphoric device. This 
is demonstrated by the following output generated 
for discourse (2.8) by our anaphora resolution 
system. This discourse contains total 13 clauses 
from 0 ? 12. Clause 1 contains third person 
anaphoric device ?? ([?s]) that is resolved to 
????? ??    which is assigned weight 12 on the basis 
of lexical filter and distance preference, so, ???????  
is ruled out to become the antecedent since its 
weight is 1. Similarly for the third person 
anaphoric device ??, that appears in clause 4, 
antecedent with highest weight 50 is ??????? . By the 
same token, for the resolution of the first person 
anaphoric device ???? , preference has been given to 
the noun ?????  (Fig-2) that is the subject in the 
previous clause. 
 
 
clause      1 , SUB ( ?? )       RESTO   ( 12  ????? ?? )( 1  ???????  ) 
clause      4 , SUB ( ?? )        RESTO   ( 50  ??????? )( 12  ????? ?? )( 12  ??????? )( 11  ??????? )( 11  ??????  ) 
clause      6 , SUB ( ?? )       RESTO   (   )????? ?? )( 12  ??????? )( 7  ??????? )( 7  ???? )( 7  ?????   
clause      8 , SUB ( ?? )       RESTO   (   )5  ????? ?? )( 3  ??????? )( 3  ??????? )( 3  ????? )( 1  ?????? )( 1  ???????   
clause      9 , SUB ( ???  )      RESTO   ( 14 ?????(  )6  ??????? )( 2  ???? )( 1  ??????? )( 0  ?????? )( 0  ???????  ) 
clause     10 , SUB ( ?? )      RESTO   ( 31  ????? )( 30  ??????? )( 12  ??????? )( 11???   )( 7  ???? )( 2  ???????? ) 
clause     11 , SUB ( ???? )     RESTO   (  )49  ??????? )( 30  ??????? )( 13  ????? )( 8  ??????? )( 7  ??????   
clause     12 , DOB ( ????  )   RESTO   (   )  14????? )( 10  ??????? )( 7    ????? ?? )( 2  ???? )( 2???   )( 2????

4 Conclusion 
One central question addressed in this paper is 
to determine the optimal order of the factors to find 
the preferred antecedents for the personal ADs in 
Urdu text. Rule based algorithms for the resolution 
of personal anaphoric devices are presented which 
are capable of resolving these anaphoric devices 
with 78-80% success rate in all kind of text genres. 
This success rate can be increased with 
improvement in certain rules especially for third 
person anaphoric devices.
