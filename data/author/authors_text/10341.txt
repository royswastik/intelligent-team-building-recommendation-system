Abstract 
Machine learning methods have been exten-
sively employed in developing MT evaluation 
metrics and several studies show that it can 
help to achieve a better correlation with hu-
man assessments. Adopting the regression 
SVM framework, this paper discusses the lin-
guistic motivated feature formulation strategy. 
We argue that ?blind? combination of avail-
able features does not yield a general metrics 
with high correlation rate with human assess-
ments. Instead, certain simple intuitive fea-
tures serve better in establishing the 
regression SVM evaluation model. With six 
features selected, we show evidences to sup-
port our view through a few experiments in 
this paper. 
1 Introduction 
The automatic evaluation of machine translation 
(MT) system has become a hot research issue in 
MT circle. Compared with the huge amount of 
manpower cost and time cost of human evaluation, 
the automatic evaluations have lower cost and re-
usability. Although the automatic evaluation met-
rics have succeeded in the system level, there are 
still on-going investigations to get reference trans-
lation better (Russo-Lassner et al, 2005) or to deal 
with sub-document level evaluation (Kulesza et al, 
2004; Leusch et al 2006). 
N-grams? co-occurrence based metrics such as 
BLEU and NIST can reach a fairly good correla-
tion with human judgments, but due to their con-
sideration for the capability of generalization 
across multiple languages, they discard the inher-
ent linguistic knowledge of the sentence evaluated. 
Actually, for a certain target language, one could 
exploit this knowledge to help us developing a 
more ?human-like? metric. Gim?nez and M?rquez 
(2007) showed that compared with metrics limited 
in lexical dimension, metrics integrating deep lin-
guistic information will be more reliable. 
The introduction of machine learning methods 
aimed at the improvement of MT evaluation met-
rics? precision is a recent trend. Corston-Oliver et 
al. (2001) treated the evaluation of MT outputs as 
classification problem between human translation 
and machine translation. Kulesza et al (2004) pro-
posed a SVM classifier based on confidence score, 
which takes the distance between feature vector 
and the decision surface as the measure of the MT 
system?s output. Joshua S. Albrecht et al (2007) 
adopted regression SVM to improve the evaluation 
metric. 
In the rest of this paper, we will first discuss 
some pitfalls of the n-gram based metrics such as 
BLEU and NIST, together with the intuition that 
factors from the linguist knowledge can be used to 
evaluate MT system?s outputs. Then, we will pro-
pose a MT evaluation metric based on SVM re-
gression using information from various linguistic 
levels (lexical level, phrase level, syntax level and 
sentence-level) as features. Finally, from empirical 
studies, we will show that this metric, with less 
simple linguistic motivated features, will result in a 
better correlation with human judgments than pre-
vious regression-based methods. 
2 N-gram Based vs Linguistic Motivated 
Metrics 
N-gram co-occurrence based metrics is the main 
trend of MT evaluation. The basic idea is to com-
pute the similarity between MT system output and 
25
several human reference translations through the 
co-occurrence of n-grams. BLEU (Papineni et al, 
2002) is one of the most popular automatic evalua-
tion metrics currently used. Although with a good 
correlation with human judgment, it still has some 
defects: 
? BLEU considers precision regardless of recall. 
To avoid a low recall, BLEU introduces a brevity 
penalty factor, but this is only an approximation.  
? Though BLEU makes use of high order n-
grams to assess the fluency of a sentence, it does 
not exploit information from inherent structures of 
a sentence. 
? BLEU is a ?perfect matching only? metric. 
This is a serious problem. Although it can be alle-
viated by adding more human reference transla-
tions, there may be still a number of informative 
words that will be labeled as ?unmatched?. 
? BLEU lacks models determining each n-
gram?s own contribution to the meaning of the sen-
tence. Correct translations of the headwords which 
express should be attached more importance to 
than that of accessory words e.g. 
? While computing geometric average of preci-
sions from unigram to n-gram, if a certain preci-
sion is zero, the whole score will be zero.  
In the evaluation task of a MT system with cer-
tain target language, the intuition is that we can 
fully exploit linguistic information, making the 
evaluation progress more ?human-like? while leav-
ing the capability of generalization across multiple 
languages (just the case that BLEU considers) out 
of account. 
Following this intuition, from the plentiful lin-
guist information, we take the following factors in 
to consideration: 
? Content words are important to the semantic 
meaning of a sentence. A better translation will 
include more substantives translated from the 
source sentence than worse ones. In a similar way, 
a machine translation should be considered a better 
one, if more content words in human reference 
translations are included in it. 
? At the phrase level, the situation above re-
mains the same, and what is more, real phrases are 
used to measure the quality of the machine transla-
tions instead of merely using n-grams which are of 
little semantic information. 
? In addition, the length of translation is usually 
in good proportion to the source language. We be-
lieve that a human reference translation sentence 
has a moderate byte-length ratio to the source sen-
tence. So a machine translation will be depreciated 
if it has a ratio considerably different from the ratio 
calculated from reference sentences. 
? Finally, a good translation must be a ?well-
formed? sentence, which usually brings a high 
probability score in language models, e.g. n-gram 
model. 
In the next section, using regression SVM, we 
will build a MT evaluation metric for Chinese-
English translation with features selected from 
above aspects. 
3 A Regression SVM Approach Based on 
Linguistic Motivated Features 
Introducing machine learning methods to establish 
MT evaluation metric is a recent trend. Provided 
that we could get many factors of human judg-
ments, machine learning will be a good method to 
combine these factors together. As proved in the 
recent literature, learning from regression is of a 
better quality than from classifier (Albrecht and 
Hwa, 2007; Russo-Lassner et al, 2005; Quirk, 
2004). In this paper, we choose regression support 
vector machine (SVM) as the learning model.  
3.1 Learning from human assessment data 
The machine translated sentences for model train-
ing are provided with human assessment data score 
together with several human references. Each sen-
tence is treated as a training example. We extract 
feature vectors from training examples, and human 
assessment score will act as the output of the target 
function. The regression SVM will generate an 
approximated function which maps multi-
dimensional feature vectors to a continuous real 
value with a minimal error rate according to a loss 
function. This value is the result of the evaluation 
process.  
Figure 1 shows our general framework for re-
gression based learning, in which we train the 
SVM with a number of sentences x1, x2, ? with 
human assessment scores y1, y2, ? and use the 
trained model to evaluate an test sentence x with 
feature vector (f1, f2 ,?, fn). To determine which 
indicators of a sentence are chosen as features is 
research in progress, but we contend that ?the more 
features, the better quality? is not always true. 
Large feature sets require more computation cost, 
though maybe result in a metric with a better corre-
26
lation with human judgments, it can also be 
achieved by introducing a much smaller feature set. 
Moreover, features may conflict with each others, 
and bring down the performance of the metric. We 
will show this in the next section, using less than 
10 features stated in section 3.2. Some details of 
the implementation will also be described.  
Figure 1: SVM based model of automatic MT evalua-
tion metric 
3.2 Feature selection 
A great deal of information can be extracted from 
the MT systems? output using linguistic knowledge. 
Some of them can be very informative while easy 
to obtain.  
As considered in section 2, we choose factors 
from lexical level, phrase level, syntax level and 
sentence-level as features to train the SVM. 
? Features based on translation quality of con-
tent words 
The motivation is that content words are carry-
ing more important information of a sentence 
compared with function words. In this paper, con-
tent words include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adver-
bials, pronouns and cardinal numerals. The 
corresponding features are the precision of content 
words defined in Eq. 1 and the recall defined in Eq. 
2 where ref means reference translation. 
( )
# _ _ _ _
# _ _
conprecision t
correctly translated cons in t
cons in t
=         (1) 
( )
# _ _ _ _ _ _
# _ _ _
conrecall t
cons in ref correctly translated in t
cons in the ref
=     (2) 
? Features based on cognate words matching 
English words have plenty of morphological 
changes. So if a machine translation sentence 
shares with a human reference sentence some cog-
nates, it contains at least some basic information 
correct. And if we look at it in another way, words 
that do not match in the original text maybe match 
after morphological reduction. Thus, differences 
between poor translations will be revealed. Simi-
larly, we here define the content word precision 
and recall after morphological reduction in Eq. 3 
and Eq. 4 where mr_cons means content words 
after morphological reduction: 
_ ( )
# _ _ _ _ _
# _ _ _
mr conprecision t
correctly translated mr cons in t
mr cons in t
=   (3) 
_ ( )
# _ _ _ _ _ _ _
# _ _ _ _
mr conrecall t
mr cons in ref correctly translated in t
mr cons in the ref
=  (4) 
? Features based on translation quality of 
phrases 
Phrases are baring the weight of semantic in-
formation more than words. In manual evaluation, 
or rather, in a human?s mind, phrases are paid spe-
cial attention to. Here we parse every sentence1 and 
extract several types of phrases, then, compute the 
precision and recall of each type of phrase accord-
ing to Eq. 5 and Eq. 62: 
tinphrs
tinphrstranslatedcorrectly
tprecisionphr
__#
____#
)( =      (5) 
reftheinphr
tintranslatedcorrectlyrefinphr
trecallphr
___#
______#
)( =    (6) 
In practice, we found that if we compute these 
two indicators by matching phrases case-
insensitive, we will receive a metric with higher 
performance. We speculate that by doing this the 
difference between poor translations is revealed 
just like morphological reduction. 
? Features based on byte-length ratio 
Gale and Church (1991) noted that he byte-
length ratio of target sentence to source sentence is 
normally distributed. We employ this observation 
by computing the ratio of reference sentences to 
                                                 
1 The parser we used is proposed by Michael Collins in Col-
lins (1999). 
2 Only precision and recall of NP are used so far. Other types 
of phrase will be added in future study.

source sentences, and then calculating the mean c 
and variance s of this ratio. So if we take the ratio r 
as a random variable, (r-c)/s has a normal distribu-
tion with mean 0 and variance 1. Then we compute 
the same ratio of machine translation sentence to 
source sentence, and take the output of p-norm 
function as a feature:

? Features based on parse score 
The usual practice to model the ?well-
formedness? of a sentence is to employ the n-gram 
language model or compute the syntactic structure 
similarity (Liu and Gildea 2005). However, the 
language model is widely adopted in MT, resulting 
less discrimination power. And the present parser 
is still not satisfactory, leading much noise in parse 
structure matching.  
To avoid these pitfalls in using LM and parser, 
here we notice that the score of a parse by the 
parser also reflects the quality of a sentence. It may 
be regarded as a syntactic based language model 
score as well as an approximate representation of 
parse structure. Here we introduce the feature 
based on parser?s score as:

4 Experiments 
We use SVM-Light (Joachims 1999) to train our 
learning models. Our main dataset is NIST?s 2003 
Chinese MT evaluations. There are 6?919=5514 
sentences generated by six systems together with 
human assessment data which contains a fluency 
score and adequacy score marked by two human 
judges. Because there is bias in the distributions of 
the two judges? assessment, we normalize the 
scores following Blatz et al (2003). The normal-
ized score is the average of the sum of the normal-
ized fluency score and the normalized adequacy 
score. 
To determine the quality of a metric, we use 
Spearman rank correlation coefficient which is 
distribution-independent between the score given 
to the evaluative data and human assessment data. 
The Spearman coefficient is a real number ranging 
from -1 to +1, indicating perfect negative correla-
tions or perfect positive correlations. We take the 
correlation rates of the metrics reported in Albrecht 
and Hwa (2007) and a standard automatic metric 
BLEU as a baseline comparison.  
Among the features described in section 3.2, we 
finally adopted 6 features: 
? Content words precision and recall after mor-
phological reduction defined in Eq. 3 and Eq. 4. 
? Noun-phrases? case insensitive precision and 
recall. 
? P-norm (Eq. 7) function?s output. 
? Rescaled parser score defined in Eq. 8. Our 
first experiment will compare the correlation rate 
between metric using rescaled parser score and that 
using parser score directly. 
4.1 Different kernels 
Intuitively, features and the resulting assessment 
are not in a linear correlation. We trained two 
SVM, one with linear kernel and the other with 
Gaussian kernel, using NIST 2003 Chinese dataset. 
Then we apply the two metrics on NIST 2002 Chi-
nese Evaluation dataset which has 3?878=2634 
sentences (3 systems total). The results are summa-
rized in Table 1. For comparison, the result from 
BLEU is also included. 
Feature Linear Gaussian  BLEU 
Rescale 0.320 0.329 
Direct 0.317 0.224 
0.244 
Table 1: Spearman rank-correlation coefficients for re-
gression based metrics using linear and Gaussian kernel, 
and using rescaled parser score or directly the parser 
score. Coefficient for BLEU is also involved. 
Table 1 shows that the metric with Gaussian 
kernel using rescaled parser score gains the highest 
correlation rate. That is to say, Gaussian kernel 
function can capture characteristics of the relation 
better, and rescaling the parser score can help to 
increase the correlation with human judgments. 
Moreover, as other features range from 0 to 1, we 
can discover in the second row of Table 1 that 
Gaussian kernel is suffering more seriously from 
the parser score which is ranging distinctly. In fol-
lowing experiments, we will adopt Gaussian kernel 
to train the SVM and rescaled parser score as a 
feature. 
4.2 Comparisons within the year 2003 
We held out 1/6 of the assessment dataset for pa-
rameter turning, and on the other 5/6 of dataset, we 
perform a five-fold cross validation to verify the 
metric?s performance. In comparison we introduce 
28
several metrics? coefficients reported in Albrecht 
and Hwa (2007) including smoothed BLEU (Lin 
and Och, 2004), METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 
2005), HWCM (Liu and Gildea 2005), and the me-
tric proposed in Albrecht and Hwa (2007) using 
the full feature set. The results are summarized in 
Table 2: 
Metric Coefficient
Our Metric 0.515 
Albrecht, 2007 0.520 
Smoothed BLEU 0.272 
METEOR 0.318 
HWCM 0.288 
Table 2: Comparison among various metrics. Learning-
based metrics are developed from NIST 2003 Chinese 
Evaluation dataset and tested under five-fold cross vali-
dation. 
Compared with reference based metrics such as 
BLEU, the regression based metrics yield a higher 
correlation rate. Generally speaking, for a given 
source sentence, there is usually a lot of feasible 
translations, but reference translations are always 
limited though this can be eased by adding refer-
ences. On the other hand, regression based metrics 
is independent of references and make the assess-
ment by mapping features to the score, so it can 
make a better judgment even dealing with a trans-
lation that doesn?t match the reference well.  
We can also see that our metric which uses only 
6 features can reach a pretty high correlation rate 
which is close to the metric proposed in Albrecht 
and Hwa (2007) using 53 features. That confirms 
our speculation that a small feature set can also 
result in a metric having a good correlation with 
human judgments. 
4.3 Crossing years  
Though the training set and test set in the experi-
ment described above are not overlapping, in the 
last, they come from the same dataset (NIST 2003). 
The content of this dataset are Xinhua news and 
AFC news from Jan. 2003 to Feb. 2003 which has 
an inherent correlation. To test the capability of 
generalization of our metric, we trained a metric on 
the whole NIST 2003 Chinese dataset (20% data 
are held out for parameter tuning) and applied it 
onto NIST 2002 Chinese Evaluation dataset. We 
use the same metrics introduced in section 4.2 for 
comparison. The results are summarized in Table 3: 
 
Metric Coefficient 
Our Metric 0.329 
Albrecht, 2007 0.309 
Smoothed BLEU 0.269 
METEOR 0.290 
HWCM 0.260 
Table 3: Cross year experiment result. All the learning 
based metrics are developed from NIST 2003.  
The content of NIST 2002 Chinese dataset is 
Xinhua news and Zaobao?s online news from Mar. 
2002 to Apr. 2002. The most remarkable character-
istic of news is its timeliness. News come from the 
year 2002 are nearly totally unrelated to that from 
the year 2003. It can be seen from Table 3 that we 
have got the expected results. Our metric can gen-
eralize well across years and yields a better corre-
lation with human judgments.  
4.4 Discussions 
Albrecht and Hwa (2007) and this paper both 
adopted a regression-based learning method. In 
fact, the preliminary experiment is strictly set ac-
cording to their paper. The most distinguishing 
difference is that the features in Albrecht and Hwa 
(2007) are collections of existing automatic evalua-
tion metrics. The total 53 features are computa-
tionally heavy (for the features from METEOR, 
ROUGE, HWCM and STM). In comparison, our 
metric made use of six features coming from lin-
guistic knowledge which can be easily obtained. 
Moreover, the experiments show that our metric 
can reach a correlation with human judgments 
nearly as good as the metric described in Albrecht 
and Hwa (2007), with a much lower computation 
cost. And when we applied it to a different year?s 
dataset, its correlation rate is much better than that 
of the metric from Albrecht and Hwa (2007), 
showing us a good capability of generalization. 
To account for this, we deem that the regression 
model is not resistant to data overfiting. If pro-
vided too much cross-dependent features for a lim-
ited training data, the model is prone to a less 
generalized result. But, it is difficult in practice to 
locate those key features in human perception of 
translation quality because we are lack of explicit 
evidences on what human actually use in transla-
tion evaluation. In such cases, this paper uses only 
?simple feature in key linguistic aspects?, which 
reduces the risk of overfitting and bring a more 
generalized regression results. 
29
Compared with the literature, the ?byte-length 
ratio between source and translation? and the 
?parse score? are original in automatic MT evalua-
tion modeling. The parse score is proved to be a 
good alternative to LM. And it helps to avoid the 
errors of parser in parse structure (the experiment 
to verify this claim is still on-going). 
It should be noted that feature selection is ac-
complished by empirically exhaustive test on the 
combination of the candidate features. In future 
work, we will test if this strategy will help to get 
better results for MT evaluation, e.g. try-on the 
selection between the 53 features in Albrecht and 
Hwa (2007). And, we will also test to see if lin-
guistic motivated feature augmentation would 
bring further benefit. 
5 Conclusion 
For the metrics based on regressing, it is not al-
ways true that more features and complex features 
will help in performance. If we choose features 
elaborately, simple features are also effective. In 
this paper we proposed a regression based metric 
with a considerably small feature set that yield per-
formance of the same level to the metrics with a 
large set of 53 features. And the experiment of the 
cross-year validation proves that our metric bring a 
more generalized evaluation results by correlating 
with human judgments better.
