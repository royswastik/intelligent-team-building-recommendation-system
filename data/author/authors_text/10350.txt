Abstract. In this paper, a resolution system is presented to tackle nominal and 
pronominal anaphora in biomedical literature by using rich set of syntactic and 
semantic features. Unlike previous researches, the verification of semantic as-
sociation between anaphors and their antecedents is facilitated by exploiting 
more outer resources, including UMLS, WordNet, GENIA Corpus 3.02p and 
PubMed. Moreover, the resolution is implemented with a genetic algorithm on 
its feature selection. Experimental results on different biomedical corpora 
showed that such approach could achieve promising results on resolving the 
two common types of anaphora.  
1   Introduction 
Correct identification of antecedents for an anaphor is essential in message under-
standing systems as well as knowledge acquisition systems. For example, efficient 
anaphora resolution is needed to enhance protein interaction extraction from biomedi-
cal literature by mining more protein entity instances which are represented with 
pronouns or general concepts. 
In biomedical literature, pronominal and nominal anaphora are the two common 
types of anaphora. In past literature, different strategies to identify antecedents of  
an anaphor have been presented by using syntactic, semantic and pragmatic clues.  
For example, grammatical roles of noun phrases were used in [9] [10]. In addition to 
the syntactic information, statistical information like co-occurring patterns obtained 
from a corpus is employed during antecedent finding in [3]. However, a large corpus 
is needed for acquiring sufficient co-occurring patterns and for dealing with data 
sparseness.  
On the other hand, outer resources, like WordNet1, are applied in [4][12][15] and 
proved to be helpful to improve the system like the one described in [12] where ani-
macy information is exploited by analyzing the hierarchical relation of nouns and 
verbs in the surrounding context learned from WordNet. Nevertheless, using Word-
Net alne for acquiring semantic information is not sufficient for solving unknown 
words. To tackle this problem, a richer resource, the Web, was exploited in [16]

 Anaphora Resolution for Biomedical Literature by Exploiting Multiple Resources 743 
where anaphoric information is mined from Google search results at the expense of 
less precision. 
The domain-specific ontologies like UMLS2 (Unified Medical Language System) 
has been employed in [2] in such a way that frequent semantic types associated to 
agent (subject) and patient (object) role of subject-action or action-object patterns can 
be extracted. The result showed such kind of patterns could gain increase in both 
precision (76% to 80%) and recall (67% to 71%). On the other hand, Kim and Park 
[11] built their BioAR to relate protein names to SWISS-Prot entries by using the 
centering theory presented by [7] and salience measures by [2]. 
In this paper, a resolution system is presented for tackling both nominal anaphora 
and pronominal anaphora in biomedical literature by using various kinds of syntactic 
and semantic features. Unlike previous approaches, our verification of the semantic 
association between anaphors and their antecedents is facilitated with the help of both 
general domain and domain-specific resources. For example, the semantic type check-
ing for resolving nominal anaphora can be done by the domain ontology UMLS and 
PubMed3, the search engine for MEDLINE databases. Here, UMLS is used not only 
for tagging the semantic type for the noun phrase chunks if they are in UMLS, but 
also for generating the key lexicons for each type so that we can use them to tag those 
chunks if they are not in UMLS. If no type information can be obtained from an 
chunk, then its type finding will be implemented through the web mining of PubMed. 
On the other hand, the domain corpus, GENIA 3.02p corpus [20] is exploited while 
we solve the semantic type checking for pronominal anaphora. With simple weight 
calculation, the key SA/AO (subject-action or action-object) patterns for each type 
can be mined from the corpus and they turn out to be helpful in resolution. Beside the 
semantic type agreement, the implicit resemblance between an anaphor and its ante-
cedents is another evidence useful for verifying the semantic association. Hence, the 
general domain thesaurus, WordNet, which supporting more relationship between 
concepts and subconcepts, is also employed to enhance the resemblance extraction.  
The presented resolution system is constructed on a basis of a salience grading. In 
order to boost the system, we implemented a simple genetic algorithm on its selection 
of the rich feature set. The system was developed on the small evaluation corpus 
MedStract 4 . Nevertheless, we constructed a larger test corpus (denoted as ?100-
MEDLINE?) so that more instances of anaphors can be resolved. Experimental results 
show that our resolution on MedStract can yield 92% and 78% F-Scores on resolving 
pronominal and nominal anaphora respectively. Promising results were also obtained 
on the larger corpus in terms of 87.43% and 80.61% F-scores on resloving pronomi-
nal and nominal anaphora respectively.

2.1   Syntactic Information Extraction  
Being important features for anaphora resolution, syntactic information, like POS tags 
and base NP chunks, is extracted from each document by using the Tagger5. Mean-
while, each NP will be tagged with its grammatical role, namely, ?Oblique?, ?Direct 
object?, ?Indirect object?, or ?Subject? by using the following rules which were 
adopted from [22] by adding rules 5 and 6.

Rules 5 and 6 are presented for dealing those plural anaphors in such a way that the 
syntactic agreement between the first antecedent and its anaphora is used to find other 
antecedents. For example, without rules 5 and 6, ?anti-CD4 mAb? in Example 1 will 
not be found when resolving anaphora ?they?. 
 
2.2   Semantic Information Extraction 
Beside the syntactic clues, the semantic agreement between an anaphor and its ante-
cedents can also facilitate anaphora resolution in domain-specific literature. In this 
paper, the semantic information for each target noun phrase chunk can be extracted 
with the help of the domain ontology, UMLS, which supports the semantic type for 
the chunk. However, the semantic types for those chunks which are not in UMLS are 
needed to be predicted. Therefore we need to extract the key lexicons from UMLS for 
each semantic type in background processing and use them to tag unknown chunk 
with predicted types. On the other hand, the semantic type checking for pronominal 
anaphors is done through the extraction of the key verbs for each semantic type. 
Hence, a domain corpus GENIA 3.02p is exploited in background processing.   
2.2.1   Key Lexicons for Each Semantic Type 
For each UMLS semantic type, its key lexicons are mined as the following steps in 
Figure 2: 
 
Fig. 2. Procedure to mine key lexicons for each semantic type 
A. Collect all UMLS concepts and their corresponding synonyms as type 
lexicon candidates.  
B. Tokenize the candidates. For example, concept ?interleukin-2? has 
synonyms ?Costimulator?, ?Co-Simulator?, ?IL 2?, and ?interleukine 2?. 
Then ?interleukin?, ?costimulator?, ?simulator?, ?IL?, and ?interleukine? 
will be treated as lexicon candidates.  
C. For each candidate, calculate its weight wij for each type by using Eq. 
(1) which takes into account its concentration and distribution. A prede-
fined threshold is given for the final selection of the candidates.

2.2.2   Semantic SA/AO Patterns 
As indicated previously in Section 2.2, the semantic type checking for pronominal 
anaphors can be done through the extraction of the co-occurring SA/AO patterns 
extracted from GENIA 3.02p. We tagged each base noun phrase chunk from the cor-
pus with its grammatical role and tagged it with UMLS-semantic type. Then we used 
Eq. 2 to score each pattern. At resolution, an antecedent candidate is concerned if its 
scores are greater than a given threshold. Table 1 is an example to show the key lexi-
cons and verbs for two semantic types when the semantically-typed chunk is tagged 
with the role of subject.

2.3   Anaphora Recognition 
Anaphor recognition is to recognize the target anaphors by filtering strategies. Pro-
nominal anaphora recognition is done by filtering pleonastic-it instances by using the 
set of hand-craft rules presented in [12]. On two corpora, namely, Medstract and the 
new 100-Medline corpus, 100% recognition accuracy was achieved. The remaining 
noun phrases indicated with ?it?, ?its?, ?itself?, ?they?, ?them?, ?themselves? or ?their? 
are considered as pronominal anaphor. Others like ?which? and ?that? used in relative 
clauses are treated as pronominal anaphors and are resolved by the following rules.  
Rule 1: ?that? is treated as pleonastic-that if it is paired with pleonastic-it. 
Rule 2: For a relative clause with ?which? or ?that?, the antecedents will be the 
noun phrases preceding to ?which? or ?that?. 
On the other hand, noun phrases shown with ?either?, ?this?, ?both?, ?these?, ?the?, 
and ?each? are considered as nominal anaphor candidates. Nominal anaphora recogni-
tion is approached by filtering those anaphor candidates, which have no referent ante-
cedents or which have antecedents but not in the target biomedical semantic types. 
Following are two rules used to filter out those non-target nominal anaphors.  
Rule 1: Filter out those anaphor candidates if they are not tagged with one of the 
target UMLS semantic types (the same types in [2]) 
Rule 2: Filter out ?this? or ?the? + proper nouns with capital letters or numbers. 
 Anaphora Resolution for Biomedical Literature by Exploiting Multiple Resources 747 
We treated all other anaphors indicated with ?this? or ?the + singular-NP? as singu-
lar anaphors which have one antecedent only. Others are treated as plural nominal 
anaphors and their numbers of antecedents are shown in Table 2. At antecedent selec-
tion, we can discard those candidates whose numbers differ from the corresponding 
anaphors.

2.4   Antecedent Selection 
2.4.1   Salience Grading 
The antecedent selection is based on the salience grading as shown in Table 3 in 
which seven features, including syntactic and semantic information, are concerned. 
Table 3. Salience grading for candidate antecedents 
Features Score 
F1 
recency 
0, if in two sentences away from anaphor 
1, if in one sentence away from anaphor 
2, if in same sentence as anaphor 0-2 
F2 Subject and Object Preference 1 
F3 Grammatical function agreement 1 
F4 Number Agreement 1 
F5 Semantic Longest Common Subsequence 0 to 3 
F6 Semantic Type Agreement -1 to +2 
F7 Biomedical antecedent preference -2 if not or +2 
The first feature F1 is recency which measures the distance between an anaphor 
and candidate antecedents in number of sentences. From the statistics of the two cor-
pora, most of antecedents and their corresponding anaphors are within in two sentence 
distance, so a window size for finding antecedent candidates is set to be two sentences 
in the proposed system. The second feature F2 concerns the grammatical roles that an  
 
748 T. Liang and Y.-H. Lin 
anaphor plays in a sentence. Since many anaphors are subjects or objects so antece-
dents with such grammatical tags are preferred. Furthermore, the antecedent candi-
dates will receive more scores if they have grammatical roles (feature F3) or number 
agreement (feature F4) with their anaphors.  
On the other hand, features 5, 6, and 7 are related to semantic association. Feature 
5 concerns the fact that the anaphor and its antecedents are semantical variants of 
each other, so antecedents will receive different scores (as shown below) on the basis 
of their variation: 
 
Following are examples to show the cases: 
 
 
Fig. 3. Procedure to find semantic types for antecedent candidates 
If the antecedent can be found by UMLS,  
Then record its semantic types;  
Else If the antecedent contains the mined key lexicons of the anaphor?s se-
mantic type, then record the semantic type;  
Else mine the semantic type by web mining in such a way that searching 
PubMed by issuing {anaphor Ana, antecedent Ai } pair and apply-
ing Eq. 3 to grade its semantic agreement for Ai.

case 3: component match by using WordNet 2.0: 
<Anaphor: this protein (hyponym: growth factor), antecedent: Cleavage 
and polyadenylation specificity factor> 
If  there is total match of the semantic lexicons between an antecedent?s head 
word  and its anaphor  
Then salience score = salience score + 3 
Else If any antecedent component, other than head word, is matched  
   with its anaphor 
 Then salience score = salience score + 2 
 Else If  any antecedent component is matched with its anaphor?s  
             hyponym by WordNet 2.0 
         Then  salience score = salience score + 1 
 Anaphora Resolution for Biomedical Literature by Exploiting Multiple Resources 749 
Feature 6 is the semantic type agreement between anaphors and antecedents. As 
described in figure 3, the type finding for each antecedent can implemented with the 
help of UMLS. When there is no type information can be obtained from an antece-
dent, the type finding can be implemented with the help of PubMed, and the grading 
on such antecedent will be as Eq. 3. Feature 7 is biomedical antecedent preference. 
That is an antecedent which can be tagged with UMLS or the key lexicons database 
will receive more score.  
2.4.2   Antecedent Selection Strategies 
The noun phrases which precede a recognized anaphor in the range of two sentences 
will be treated as candidates and will be assigned with zero at initial state by the pre-
sented salience grader. Antecedents can be selected by the following strategies. 
(1) Best First: select antecedents with the highest salience score that is greater 
than a threshold  
(2) Nearest First: select the nearest antecedents whose salience value is greater 
than a given threshold 
For plural anaphors, their antecedents are selected as follows: 
(1) If the number of the antecedents is known, then select the same number of 
top-score antecedents.  
(2) If the number of antecedents is unknown, then select those antecedent candi-
dates whose scores are greater than a threshold and whose grammatical pat-
terns are the same as the top-score candidate. 
2.5   Experiments and Analysis 
As mentioned in previous sections, a larger corpus was used for testing the proposed 
system. The corpus, denoted as ?100-Medline?, contains 100 MEDLINE abstracts 
including 43 abstracts (denoted as ?43-Genia? in Table 6) randomly selected from 
GENIA 3.02p and another 57 abstracts (denoted as ?57-PubMed? in Table 6) collected 
from the search results of PubMed (by issuing ?these proteins? and ?these receptors? in 
order to acquire more anaphor instances). There is no common abstract in the public 
MedStract and the new corpus. Table 4 shows the statistics of pronominal and nomi-
nal anaphors for each corpus.

     The proposed approach was verified with experiments in two ways. One is to in-
vestigate the impact of the features which are concerned in the resolution. Another is 
to compare different resolution approaches. In order to boost our system, a simple 
750 T. Liang and Y.-H. Lin 
generic algorithm is implemented to yield the best set of features by choosing best 
parents to produce offspring.  
In the initial state, we chose features (10 chromosomes), and chose crossover fea-
ture to produce offspring randomly. We calculated mutations for each feature in each 
chromosome, and evaluated chromosome with maximal F-Score. Top 10 chromo-
somes were chosen for next generation and the algorithm terminated if two contigu-
ous generations did not increase the F-score. The time complexity associated with 
such approach is O(MN) where M is the number of candidate antecedents, N is num-
ber of anaphors.

Table 5 shows that anaphora resolution implemented with the genetic algorithm 
indeed achieves higher F-scores than the one when all features are concerned. Table 
5 also shows that the semantic features play more important role than the syntactic 
features for nominal anaphora resolution. Similar results can be also found in Table 
6 where the impact of each feature is justified. Moreover, Table 6 indicates that the 
pronominal anaphora resolution on 43-Genia is better than that on the other two 
corpora. It implies that the mined SA/AO patterns from GENIA 3.02p corpus are 
 Anaphora Resolution for Biomedical Literature by Exploiting Multiple Resources 751 
helpful for pronominal anaphora resolution. Moreover, Table 7 proves that the key 
lexicons mined from UMLS for semantic type finding indeed enhance anaphora 
resolution, yet a slight improvement is found with the usage of PubMed search 
results. One of the reasons is few unknown instances in our corpora.   
On the other hand, comparisons with evaluation corpus, Medstract, were shown 
in Table 8 where the best-first strategy yielded higher F-score than the results by the 
nearest-first strategy. It also shows that the best-first strategy with the best selection 
by genetic approach achieves higher F-scores than the approach presented in [2].

3   Conclusion 
In this paper, the resolution for pronominal and nominal anaphora in biomedical lit-
erature is addressed. The resolution is constructed with a salience grading on various 
kinds of syntactic and semantic features. Unlike previous researches, we exploit more 
resources, including both domain-specific and general thesaurus and corpus, to verify 
the semantic association between anaphors and their antecedents. Experimental re-
sults on different corpora prove that the semantic features provided with the help of 
the outer resources indeed can enhance anaphora resolution. Compared to other ap-
proaches, the presented best-first strategy with the genetic-algorithm based feature 
selection can achieve the best resolution on the same evaluation corpus.
