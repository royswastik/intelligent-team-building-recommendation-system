Abstract 
Myanmar script uses no space between 
words and syllable segmentation represents 
a significant process in many NLP tasks 
such as word segmentation, sorting, line 
breaking and so on. In this study, a rule-
based approach of syllable segmentation 
algorithm for Myanmar text is proposed. 
Segmentation rules were created based on 
the syllable structure of Myanmar script 
and a syllable segmentation algorithm was 
designed based on the created rules. A 
segmentation program was developed to 
evaluate the algorithm. A training corpus 
containing 32,283 Myanmar syllables was 
tested in the program and the experimental 
results show an accuracy rate of 99.96% 
for segmentation. 
1 Introduction 
Myanmar language, also known as Burmese, is the 
official language of the Union of Myanmar. It is 
spoken by 32 million as a first language, and as a 
second language by ethnic minorities in Myanmar 
(Ethnologue, 2005). Burmese is a member of the 
Tibeto-Burman languages, which is a subfamily of 
the Sino-Tibetan family of languages. Burmese is a 
tonal and analytic language using the Burmese 
script. This is a phonologically based script, 
adapted from Mon, and ultimately based on an In-
dian (Brahmi) prototype (Daniels and Bright, 
1996). Burmese characters are rounded in shape 
and the script is written from left to right. No space 
is used between words but spaces are usually used 
to separate phrases. 
The Myanmar language still remains as one of 
the less privileged Asian languages in cyberspace. 
Many people have put considerable effort into the 
computerization of the Myanmar script. However, 
Myanmar still lacks support on computers and not 
many NLP tools and applications are available for 
this language. A standard encoding is needed for 
the language processing of Myanmar script; how-
ever, there is not yet any official national standard 
encoding for Myanmar script. 
This study focuses on the syllable segmentation 
of Myanmar text based on the UTN11-21 encoding 
model for Myanmar script. Myanmar script has 
been granted space in Unicode (U+1000-U+109F) 
since version 3.0. In Unicode version 4.0, the Uni-
code consortium defined standards for encoding 
Myanmar script and canonical order. The current 
version of Unicode is 5.0. However, there are only 
a few Unicode-compliant Myanmar fonts that fully 
follow the Unicode encoding standard. Local font 
developers and implementers have produced fonts 
that follow only part of the Unicode standards and 
many of these partially-compliant fonts are widely 
used in cyberspace. In 2006, Myanmar proposed 
additional characters2 to be added to the Unicode 
version 5.0. The proposed characters for the Bur-
mese script are as follows: 
? 102B MYANMAR VOWEL SIGN TALL 
AA 
? 1039 MYANMAR SIGN VIRAMA             
[Glyph change and note change]

The Unicode technical committee has accepted 
these proposed characters for inclusion in future 
versions of the Unicode standard.3 If the proposal 
is adopted, this will become the standard encoding 
for Myanmar script. Therefore, this paper employs 
the proposed encoding model for the syllable seg-
mentation of Myanmar text. 
2 Related Work 
The lack of official standard encoding hinders lo-
calization of Myanmar language and no previous 
work on the syllable segmentation of Myanmar 
script was found. Although character codes for 
Myanmar languages have been allocated in 
UCS/Unicode (U+1000?U+109F), lack of imple-
mentation makes them unavailable to local end 
users (Ko Ko and Mikami, 2005). We can learn, 
however, from related works done for other lan-
guages which have similarities to Myanmar. Many 
attempts have been made in Thai language proc-
essing for syllable and word segmentation. 
Poowarawan (1986) proposed a dictionary-based 
approach to Thai syllable separation. Thai syllable 
segmentation was considered as the first step to-
wards word segmentation and many of word seg-
mentation ambiguities were resolved at the level of 
syllable segmentation (Aroonmanakun, 2002). 
Thai syllable segmentation can be viewed as the 
problem of inserting spaces between pairs of char-
acters in the text and the character-level ambiguity 
of word segmentation can be reduced by extracting 
syllables whose structures are more well-defined 
(Sornil and Chaiwanarom, 2004). Most approaches 
                                                 
3 http://www.unicode.org/alloc/Pipeline.html 
to Thai word segmentation use a dictionary as their 
basis. However, the segmentation accuracy de-
pends on the quality of the dictionary used for 
analysis and unknown words can reduce the per-
formance. Theeramunkong and Usanavasin (2001) 
proposed a non dictionary-based approach to Thai 
word segmentation. A method based on decision 
tree models was proposed and their approach 
claimed to outperform some well-known diction-
ary-dependent techniques of word segmentation 
such as the maximum and the longest matching 
methods. 
3 Myanmar Alphabets 
In order to clarify the syllable structure, characters 
of the Myanmar script are classified into twelve 
categories. Each category is given a name and the 
glyphs and Unicode code points of characters be-
longing to each category are shown in Table 1.  
The Myanmar script consists of a total of 75 char-
acters. There are 34 consonant letters in Conso-
nants group, four medials in the Medials group and 
eight vowels in the Dependent Vowels group. 
Myanmar Sign Virama is used for stacking conso-
nant letters and it does not have a glyph, while 
Myanmar Sign Asat is used in devowelising proc-
ess (e.g. ???). There are three dependent various 
signs in Group F. The Group I consists of three 
independent vowels (?, ?, ?) and three inde-
pendent various signs (?, ?, ?). The characters 
in Group I can act as stand-alone syllables. Group 
E consists of four independent vowels (?, ?, ?, 
?) and Myanmar Symbol Aforementioned (?). 
Each of the independent vowels in group E has its 
own syllable but they can also combine with other 
signs to form a syllable (e.g. ??% ?). Myanmar 
Symbol Aforementioned in Group E can never 
stand alone and it is always written as ???? as a 
short form of ??????????. Myanmar Letter Great 
Sa is always preceded by a consonant and is never 
written alone (e.g. ????). There are ten Myanmar 
digits in the Digits group. The group P consists of 
two Myanmar punctuation marks. Myanmar script 
uses white space between phrases, which is taken 
into account in this study. Non-Myanmar charac-
ters are not included in this study.

Table 1. Classification of Myanmar Script 
 
4 Syllable Structure 
A Myanmar syllable consists of one initial 
consonant, zero or more medials, zero or more 
vowels and optional dependent various signs. 
Independent vowels, independent various signs and 
digits can act as stand-alone syllables. According 
to the Unicode standard, vowels are stored after the 
consonant. Therefore, Myanmar vowel sign E 
(U+1031) is stored after the consonant although it 
is placed before the consonant in rendering (e.g. 
??). Medials may appear at most three times in a 
syllable (e.g. ??i?). Vowels may appear twice in a 
syllable (e.g. ???). In a syllable, a second 
consonant may come together with an Asat for 
devowelising (e.g. ???). Each of the independent 
vowels in group E has its own syllable but they can 
also combine with other signs (consonants, 
dependent vowels, dependent various signs) to 
form a syllable (e.g. ??j?k, ??% ?, ??, ?l?????). The 
syllable structure of Myanmar script can be written 
in BNF (Backus-Naur Form) as follows: 
Syllable ::= C{M}{V}{F} | C{M}V+A | 
C{M}{V}CA[F] | E[CA][F] | I | D 
 
 
Figure 1. FSA for Syllable Structure 
 
A finite state machine or finite state automaton 
(FSA) can be employed to demonstrate the syllable 
structure of Myanmar script. A finite state machine 
is a model of behavior composed of a finite num-
ber of states, transitions between those states, and 
actions. The starting state is shown by a bold circle 
and double circles indicate final or accepting 
states. The above figure shows a finite state 
automaton that can realize a Myanmar syllable. 
Examples of Myanmar syllables and their equiva-
lent Unicode code points are shown in Table 2.

5 Syllable Segmentation Rules 
Typically, a syllable boundary can be determined 
by comparing pairs of characters to find whether a 
break is possible or not between them. However, in 
some cases it is not sufficient to determine a sylla-
ble boundary by just comparing two characters. 
The following sections explain these cases and 
give examples.  
5.1 Devowelising 
In one syllable, a consonant may appear twice but 
the second consonant is used for the devowelising 
process in conjunction with an Asat (U+103A 
MYANMAR SIGN ASAT). Therefore the charac-
ter after the second consonant should be further 
checked for an Asat. If the character after the sec-
ond consonant is an Asat, there should be no sylla-
ble break before the second consonant. 
 
        No break  
     
??? ? ?  ?  (elephant) 
C  C A 
  
   No break 
5.2 Syllable Chaining 
Subjoined characters are shown by using an invisi-
ble Virama sign (U+1039 MYANMAR SIGN VI-
RAMA) to indicate that the following character is 
subjoined and should take a subjoined form. In this 
case, if the character after the second consonant is 
an invisible Virama sign, there should be no sylla-
ble break before the second and third consonant. 
Although there are two syllables in a subjoined 
form, it is not possible to separate them in written 
form and they are therefore treated as one syllable. 
 
        No break 
 
??? ? ? ? ? ? ? (novel) 
  C C S  C  V 
 
No break 
 
54
5.3 Kinzi 
Kinzi is a special form of devowelised Nga 
(U+1004 MYANMAR LETTER NGA) with the 
following letter underneath, i.e., subjoined. In this 
case, if the character after the second consonant is 
an Asat and the next character after Asat is an in-
visible Virama sign (U+1039 MYANMAR SIGN 
VIRAMA) then there should be no syllable break 
before the second and third consonant. Kinzi also 
consists of two syllables but it is treated as one 
syllable in written form. 
 
 No break 
 
????? ?  ? ?  ?  ? - ? ? (blessing) 
  C C A S  C - C V 
 
No break 
5.4 Loan Words 
Usage of loan words can be found in Myanmar 
text. Although loan words do not follow the 
Myanmar syllable structure, their usage is common 
and the segmentation rules for these words are 
considered in this study. 
 
  No break 
 
???????????       ? ? ? ? ? - ?  ?  ?  ? ? ?  (Mars) 
                   C V F C A - C M V V C  A 
  
 No break 
5.5 Great Sa 
There should be no syllable break before great Sa 
(U+103F MYANMAR LETTER GREAT SA) as 
great Sa acts like a stacked ??  and devowelises the 
preceding consonant.  
 
   No break 
 
???? ? -  ? ?  ? (human) 
  C - C V G 
 
           No break 
5.6 Contractions 
There are usages of double-acting consonants in 
Myanmar text. The double-acting consonant acts 
as both the final consonant of one syllable and the 
initial consonant of the following syllable. There 
are two syllables in a contracted form but they can-
not be segmented in written form and there should 
be no syllable break between them. 
 
   No break 
 
???????? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? (man) 
  C  V  V   C A M V F 
 
No break 
6 Implementation 
Syllable segmentation rules are presented in the 
form of letter sequence tables (Tables 4-6). The 
tables were created by comparing each pair of 
character categories. However, it is not sufficient 
to determine all syllable breaks by comparing only 
two characters. In some cases, a maximum of four 
consecutive characters need to be considered to 
determine a possible syllable boundary. Two addi-
tional letter sequence tables were created for this 
purpose (Tables 5 and 6).  
Table 4 defines the break status for each pair of 
two consecutive characters. Table 5 and 6 define 
the break status for each pair of three and four con-
secutive characters, respectively. The symbol U in 
the Table 4 and 5 stands for undefined cases. Cases 
undefined in Table 4 are defined in the Table 5, 
and those undefined in Table 5 are then defined in 
Table 6. 
The syllable segmentation program obtains the 
break status for each pair of characters by compar-
ing the input character sequence with the letter se-
quence tables. The syllable break status and defini-
tions are shown in Table 3. The break status -1 in-
dicates a breach of canonical spelling order and a 
question mark is appended after the ambiguous 
character pair. The status 0 means there should be 
no syllable break after the first character. For break 
cases, a syllable breaking symbol (i.e. B in the 
flowchart) is inserted at each syllable boundary of 
the input string. The syllable segmentation process 
is shown in the flowchart in Figure 2.

7 Method and Results 
A syllable segmentation program was developed to 
evaluate the algorithm and segmentation rules.  
The program accepts the Myanmar text string and 
shows the output string in a segmented form. The 
program converts the input text string into equiva-
lent sequence of category form (e.g. CMCACV for 
??????) and compares the converted character se-
quence with the letter sequence tables to determine 
syllable boundaries. A syllable segmented Myan-
mar text string is shown as the output of the pro-
gram. The symbol "|" is used to represent the syl-
lable breaking point. In order to evaluate the accu-
racy of the algorithm, a training corpus was devel-
oped by extracting 11,732 headwords from Myan-
mar Orthography (Myanmar Language Commis-
sion, 2003). The corpus contains a total of 32,238 
Myanmar syllables. These syllables were tested in 
the program and the segmented results were manu-
ally checked. The results showed 12 errors of in-
correctly segmented syllables, thus achieving accu-
racy of 99.96% for segmentation. The few errors 
occur with the Myanmar Letter Great Sa ??? and 
the Independent Vowel ???. The errors can be fixed 
by updating the segmentation rules of these two 
characters in letter sequence tables. Some exam-
ples of input text strings and their segmented re-
sults are shown in Table 7.  
8 Conclusion 
Syllables are building blocks of words and syllable 
segmentation is essential for the language process-
ing of Myanmar script. In this study, a rule-based 
approach of syllable segmentation algorithm for 
Myanmar script is presented. The segmentation 
rules were created based on the characteristics of 
Myanmar syllable structure. A segmentation pro-
gram was developed to evaluate the algorithm. A 
test corpus containing 32,238 Myanmar syllables 
was tested in the program and 99.96% accuracy 
was achieved. From this study, we can conclude 
that syllable segmentation of Myanmar text can be 
implemented by a rule-based approach. While 
characters of non-Myanmar script are not consid-
ered in this study, the segmentation rules can be 
further extended to cover these characters. A com-
plete syllable segmentation algorithm for Myanmar 
script can be further implemented by applying this 
algorithm.
