Abstract 
In this article we present a method for combining different information retrieval models in order to increase the retrieval performance 
in a Speech Information Retrieval task. The formulas for combining the models are tuned on training data. Then the system is evaluated 
on test data. The task is particularly difficult because the text collection is automatically transcribed spontaneous speech, with many 
recognition errors. Also, the topics are real information needs, difficult to satisfy. Information Retrieval systems are not able to obtain 
good results on this data set, except for the case when manual summaries are included. 
 
1. Introduction  
Conversational speech such as recordings of interviews or 
teleconferences is difficult to search through. The 
transcripts produced with Automatic Speech Recognition 
(ASR) systems tend to contain many recognition errors, 
leading to low Information Retrieval (IR) performance 
(Oard et al, 2007). 
Previous research has explored the idea of combining 
the results of different retrieval strategies; the motivation is 
that each technique will retrieve different sets of relevant 
documents; therefore combining the results could produce 
a better result than any of the individual techniques. We 
propose new data fusion techniques for combining the 
results of different IR models. We applied our data fusion 
techniques to the Mallach collection (Oard et al, 2007) 
used in the Cross-Language Speech Retrieval (CLSR) task 
at Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2007. The 
Mallach collection comprises 8104 ?documents? which are 
manually-determined topically-coherent segments taken 
from 272 interviews with Holocaust survivors, witnesses 
and rescuers, totalling 589 hours of speech. Figure 1 shows 
the document structure in CLSR test collection, two ASR 
transcripts are available for this data, in this work we use 
the ASRTEXT2004A field provided by IBM research with 
a word error rate of 38%. Additionally, metadata fields for 
each document include: two sets of 20 automatically 
assigned keywords determined using two different kNN 
classifiers (AK1 and AK2), a set of a varying number of 
manually-assigned keywords (MK), and a manual 
3-sentence summary written by an expert in the field.  A set 
of 63 training topics and 33 test topics were generated for 
this task. The topics provided with the collection were 
created in English from actual user requests. Topics were 
structured using the standard TREC format of Title, 
Description and Narrative fields. To enable CL-SR 
experiments the topics were translated into Czech, German, 
French, and Spanish by native speakers; Figure 2 and 3 
show two examples for English and its translation in 
French respectively. Relevance judgments were generated 
using a search-guided procedure and standard pooling 
methods. See (Oard et al, 2004) for full details of the 
collection design.  
We present results on the automatic transcripts for 
English queries and translated queries (cross-language) 
for two combination methods; we also present results 
when manual summaries and manual keywords are 
indexed.

2. System Description  
Our Cross-Language Information Retrieval systems 
were built with off-the-shelf components. For the retrieval 
part, the SMART (Buckley, Salton, &Allan, 1992; Salton 
&Buckley, 1988) IR system and the Terrier (Amati &Van 
Rijsbergen, 2002; Ounis et al, 2005) IR system were 
tested with many different weighting schemes for 
indexing the collection and the queries.  
SMART was originally developed at Cornell 
University in the 1960s. SMART is based on the vector 
space model of information retrieval. We use the standard 
notation: weighting scheme for the documents, followed 
by dot, followed by the weighting scheme for the queries, 
each term-weighting scheme is described as a 
combination of term frequency, collection frequency, and 
length normalization components where the schemes are 
abbreviated according to its components variations (n no 
normalization, c cosine, t idf, l log, etc.) We used nnn.ntn, 
ntn.ntn, lnn.ntn, ann.ntn, ltn.ntn, atn.ntn, ntn.nnn , 
nnc.ntc, ntc.ntc, ntc.nnc, lnc.ntc, anc.ntc, ltc.ntc, atc.ntc 
weighting schemes (Buckley, Salton, &Allan, 1992; 
Salton &Buckley, 1988);  lnn.ntn performs very well in 
CLEF-CLSR 2005 and 2006 (Alzghool &Inkpen, 2007; 
Inkpen, Alzghool, &Islam, 2006); lnn.ntn means that lnn 
was used for documents and ntn for queries according to 
the following formulas:  
0.1)ln(nln += tfweight        (1) 
tn
Ntfweight logntn ?=     (2)      
where tf denotes the term frequency of a term t in the 
document or query, N denotes the number of documents 
in the collection, and nt denotes the number of documents 
in which the term t occurs.  
Terrier was originally developed at the University of 
Glasgow. It is based on Divergence from Randomness 
models (DFR) where IR is seen as a probabilistic process 
(Amati &Van Rijsbergen, 2002; Ounis et al, 2005). We 
experimented with the In_expC2 (Inverse Expected 
Document Frequency model with Bernoulli after-effect 
and normalization) weighting model, one of Terrier?s 
DFR-based document weighting models.  
Using the In_expC2 model, the relevance score of a 
document d for a query q is given by the formula: 
                  (3) ?
?
=
qt
dtwqtfqdsim ),(.),(
where qtf is the frequency of term t in the query q, and w(t,d) 
is the relevance score of a document d for the query term t, 
given by:

- tfne is the normalized within-document frequency of the 
term t in the document d. It is given by the normalization 2 
(Amati &Van Rijsbergen, 2002; Ounis et al, 2005): 
)_1(log
l
lavgctftfn ee ?+?=     (6) 
where c is a parameter, tf is the within-document 
frequency of the term t in the document d, l is the 
document length, and avg_l is the average document 
length in the whole collection. 
We estimated the parameter c of the Terrier's 
normalization 2 formula by running some experiments on 
the training data, to get the best values for c depending on 
the topic fields used. We obtained the following values: 
c=0.75 for queries using the Title only, c=1 for queries 
using the Title and Description fields, and c=1 for queries 
using the Title, Description, and Narrative fields. We select 
the c value that has a best MAP score according to the 
training data. 
For translating the queries from French and Spanish 
into English, several free online machine translation tools 
were used. The idea behind using multiple translations is 
that they might provide more variety of words and 
phrases, therefore improving the retrieval performance. 
Seven online MT systems (Inkpen, Alzghool, &Islam, 
2006) were used for translating from Spanish and from 
French into English. We combined the outputs of the MT 
systems by simply concatenating all the translations. All 
seven translations of a title made the title of the translated 
query; the same was done for the description and narrative 
fields.  
We propose two methods for combining IR models. We 
use the sum of normalized weighted similarity scores of 15 
different IR schemes as shown in the following formulas: 
 
 ?
?
?+=
schemsIRi
iMAPr NormSimiWiWFusion )]()([1
34      (7) 
?
?
?=
schemsIRi
iMAPr NormSimiWiWFusion )(*)(2
34      (8)                         
where Wr(i) and WMAP(i) are experimentally determined 
weights based on the recall (the number of relevant 
documents retrieved) and precision (MAP score) values for 
each IR scheme computed on the training data. For 
example, suppose that two retrieval runs r1 and r2 give 0.3 
and 0.2 (respectively) as  MAP scores on training data; we 
normalize these scores by dividing them by the maximum 
MAP value: then WMAP(r1) is 1 and WMAP(r2) is 0.66 (then 
we compute the power 3 of these weights, so that one 
weight stays 1 and the other one decreases; we chose power 
3 for MAP score and power 4 for recall, because the MAP 
is more important than the recall). We hope that when we 
multiply the similarity values with the weights and take the 
summation over all the runs, the performance of the 
combined run will improve. NormSimi is the normalized 
similarity for each IR scheme. We did the normalization by 
dividing the similarity by the maximum similarity in the 
run. The normalization is necessary because different 
weighting schemes will generate different range of 
similarity values, so a normalization method should 
applied to each run.  Our method is differed than the work 
done by Fox and Shaw in (1994), and Lee in ( 1995); they 
combined the results by taking the summation of the 
similarity scores without giving any weight to each run. In 
our work we weight each run according to the precision 
and recall on the training data.  
3. Experimental Results 
We applied the data fusion methods described in section 2 
to 14 runs produced by SMART and one run produced by 
Terrier.  Performance results for each single run and fused 
runs are presented in Table 1, in which % change is given 
with respect to the run providing better effectiveness in 
each combination on the training data. The Manual 
English column represents the results when only the 
manual keywords and the manual summaries were used 
for indexing the documents using English topics, the 
Auto-English column represents the results when 
automatic transcripts are indexed from the documents, for 
English topics. For cross-languages experiments the 
results are represented in the columns Auto-French, and 
Auto-Spanish, when using the combined translations 
produced by the seven online MT tools, from French and 
Spanish into English. Since the result of combined 
translation for each language was better than when using 
individual translations from each MT tool on the training 
data (Inkpen, Alzghool, &Islam, 2006), we used only the 
combined translations in our experiments. 
Data fusion helps to improve the performance (MAP 
score) on the test data. The best improvement using data 
fusion (Fusion1) was on the French cross-language 
experiments with 21.7%, which is statistically significant 
while on monolingual the improvement was only 6.5% 
which is not significant. We computed these 
improvements relative to the results of the best 
single-model run, as measured on the training data. This 
supports our claim that data fusion improves the recall by 
bringing some new documents that were not retrieved by 
all the runs. On the training data, the Fusion2 method 
gives better results than Fusion1 for all cases except on 
Manual English, but on the test data Fusion1 is better than 
Fusion2. In general, the data fusion seems to help, 
because the performance on the test data in not always 
good for weighting schemes that obtain good results on 
the training data, but combining models allows the 
best-performing weighting schemes to be taken into 
consideration. 
The retrieval results for the translations from French 
were very close to the monolingual English results, 
especially on the training data, but on the test data the 
difference was significantly worse. For Spanish, the 
difference was significantly worse on the training data, 
but not on the test data.  
Experiments on manual keywords and manual 
summaries available in the test collection showed high 
improvements, the MAP score jumped from 0.0855 to 
0.2761 on the test data. 
4. Conclusion 
We experimented with two different systems: Terrier 
and SMART, with combining the various weighting 
schemes for indexing the document and query terms. We 
proposed two methods to combine different weighting 
scheme from different systems, based on weighted 
summation of normalized similarity measures; the weight 
for each scheme was based on the relative precision and 
recall on the training data. Data fusion helps to improve 
the retrieval significantly for some experiments 
(Auto-French) and for other not significantly (Manual 
English). Our result on automatic transcripts for English 
queries (the required run for the CLSR task at CLEF 
2007), obtained a MAP score of 0.0855. This result was 
significantly better than the other 4 systems that 
participated in the CLSR task at CLEF 2007(Pecina et al, 
2007). 
In future work we plan to investigate more methods of 
data fusion (to apply a normalization scheme scalable to 
unseen data), removing or correcting some of the speech 
recognition errors in the ASR content words, and to use 
speech lattices for indexing.
