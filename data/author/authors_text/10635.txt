Abstract. This paper describes an automatic summarization approach
that constructs a summary by extracting the significant sentences. The
approach takes advantage of the cooccurrence relationships between
terms only in the document. The techniques used are principal compo-
nent analysis (PCA) to extract the significant terms and singular value
decompostion (SVD) to find out the significant sentences. The PCA can
quantify both the term frequency and term-term relationship in the doc-
ument by the eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs. And the sentence-term matrix
can be decomposed into the proper dimensional sentence-concentrated
and term-concentrated marices which are used for the Euclidean dis-
tances between the sentence and term vectors and also removed the noise
of variability in term usage by the SVD. Experimental results on Korean
newspaper articles show that the proposed method is to be preferred
over random selection of sentences or only PCA when summarization is
the goal.

1 Introduction
Automatic text summarization is the process of reducing the length of text
documents, while retaining the essential qualities of the orginal. Many search
engines have tried to solve the problem of information overflowing by showing
either the title and beginning of of a document. However, such the title and
beginning are insufficient to decide the relevance of the documents which user
wants to search, and this is the reason that the text summarization is required
to resolve this problem.
The process of text summarization could consist of two phases: a document
interpretation phase and a summary generation phase. The primary goal of a
document interpretation phase is to find the main theme of a document and its

corresponding significant words. Since the significant words collectively repre-
sent the main theme of a document, it is important to find them more reason-
ably. For the purpose of this doing , the word frequency of a document might
be utilized[4,8]. But this approach is limited in that cooccurrence relationships
among words are not considered at all. In contrast to word frequency, the other
method by using WordNet or a thesaurus[2] makes good use of word relationships
such as NT(narrow term), RT(related term), and so on. However such resources
require a large cost to compile, and often represent too general relationships to
fit a specific domain.
In this paper, we propose a new summarization approach by both princi-
pal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) that
are called quantification methods or statistical analysis methods. PCA is uti-
lized to find significant words or terms in the document by term-relationships.
Since the necessary term-relationships can be acquired only from the given doc-
ument by linear transformation of PCA, the proposed method need not exploit
the additional information such as WordNet or a thesaurus. And the SVD is
used to extract the significant sentences. After performing SVD, a sentence-
term matrix is decomposed into three matrices; that is, a sentence-concentrated
matrix, a term-concentrated matrix, and a singular value matrix. The distances
between significant term vectors and sentence vectors can be calculated by using
a sentence-concentrated matrix and a term-concentrated matrix. The shorter
the distance is, the more important the sentence is. In a word, to produce the
summary of a document, we first identify significant terms by the term-term
relationships of being generated by PCA, and second extract the significant
sentences by the distances betweeen significant term vectors and all sentence
vectors.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 and 3 describe the way to identify
the significant terms by PCA, and extract the significant sentences by SVD,
respectively. Section 4 reports experimental results. A brief conclusion is given
in Section 5. And this paper enlarges [7] whose main content is to find out the
significant terms by PCA.
2 Significant Term Extraction by PCA
2.1 PCA Overview and Its Application
In this subsection, we will outline PCA which is adapted from [6] and which is
used to extract the significant terms in the document.
PCA is concerned with explaining the variance?covariance structure through
a few linear combinations of the original variables. Its general objective is data
reduction and interpretation. Algebraically, principal components are particular
linear combinations of the p random variables X1, X2, ? ? ? , Xp. Geometrically,
these linear combinations represent the selection of a new coordinate system
obtained by rotating the orginal system with X1, X2, ? ? ? , Xp as the coordinate
axes.
638 C. Lee, H. Park, and C. Ock
PCA uses the covariance matrix (i.e., term-term correlation or cooccurrence
matrix) instead of the obsevation-variable matrix (i.e., sentence-term matrix)
such as Table 2. Let ? be the covariance matrix associated with the random vec-
tor XT = [X1, X2, ? ? ? , Xp]. Let ? have the eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs (?1, e1),
(?2, e2), . . . , (?p, ep) where ?1 ? ?2 ? . . . ?p ? 0 . The ith principal compo-
nent(PC) is given by
Yi = e
T
i X = e1iX1 + e2iX2 + ? ? ? + epiXp, i = 1, 2, . . . , p (1)
The first PC is the linear combination with maximum variance, and has the
widest spread in a new coordinate system geometrically. Consequently, we can
say that it can cover the distribution of term frequency of a document as wide
as possible, and also say that it has the power of explanation of the distribution
as large as possible (but, not considering the meaning).
The PCs are uncorrelated and have variances equal to the eigenvalues of ?,
and the proportion of total population variance due to the ith PC, ?i, is
?i =
?i
?1 + ?2 + . . . + ?p
, i = 1, 2, . . . , p (2)
If most (80 ? 90%) of the total population variance, for large p, can be attributed
to the first one, two, or three components, then these components can ?replace?
the original p variables without much loss of information. The first i PCs have
also maximal mutual information with respect to the inputs among projections
onto all possible i directions, and mutual information is given by I(X, Y ) =
H(X) ? H(X |Y ) [5].
As we expected, all terms of the document are not necessary to represent the
content (i.e., term frequency distribution) of the document by using a few first i
PCs, because they have most of the total population variance and maximal mutual
information as noted earlier. In addition, since PCA exploits a covariance matrix,
we can use the term-term relationships by eigenvalues and eigenvectors without
additional information resources. In the next subsection, we will describe how to
extract the significant terms by eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs of a few first i PCs.
2.2 Extracting Significant Terms by Eigenvalue-Eigenvector Pairs
We assume that the candidates for the significant terms are confined only to
nouns occurred more than 2 times in a document. We also regard the sentences as
observations, the extracted nouns (terms) as variables, and the value of variables
as the number of occurrence of terms in each sentence (cf. cumulative frequency
of the document in [7] ) .
Table 1 shows the term list extracted from one of the Korean newspaper arti-
cles composed of 12 sentences, and all of these terms have the occurrences more
than twice in the document. Since the terms occurred just once are not reason-
able to be representative nouns, we do not consider such terms. In our sample
article, 9 terms are extracted for the cadidates for the significant ones as shown in
Table 1. The sample article has 12 sentences (observations) originally, but there

are 9 ones in sentence-term matrix as shown in Table 2. The only reason for this
difference was that the sentences, which did not include the 9 extracted terms at
all, were omitted. In Table 2, the column under the head X1 shows the freqeuncy
of X1, that is, X1 occurred once in first sentence, twice in second sentence, once in
eighth sentence. In Table 3, the 9 PCs are obtained after performning PCA with
the 9 variables. The column under the head PC1 shows the eigenvector of the
first PC, for instance,
???
PC1 = (?0.713, ?0.417, ? ? ? , 0.025, 0.111). Its eigenvalue
is 0.871, and its proportion of total population is 32.34% computed by Eq. (2).
There are two steps to extract the significant terms by eigenvales and eigen-
vectors as shown in Table 3. First we need to decide how many PCs are selected,
and second to find out how to express the each selected PC. In order to select a
few most salient PCs, we can make good use of cumulative ratio of eigenvalues.
For example, the first four PCs can justify more than 90% (91.28%) of the total
sample variance, we can choose them without much loss information. In other
words, sample variance is summarized very well by these four PCs and the data
from 9 observations on 9 variables can be reasonably reduced to 9 observations
on 4 PCs. Until now, we could not know what the selected PCs represent ex-
actly, but we could describe them by their coefficients approximately. A PC can
be represented by linear combination of variables multiplied by their respective
coefficient. For instance,

Since the coefficients represent the degree of relationship between variables and
a PC, the variables with coefficient higher than 0.5 can be reasonably used to
express the PC. When the PC has not such coefficient higher than 0.5, the
variable with the highest coefficient can be also used to represent the PC. For
example, in table 3, the correlation coefficient between PC1 and X3 is 0.303,
so X3 can be selected for the description of PC1. As the most part variance of
a document justified by some of the PCs, we selected variables which have a
strong correlation (? 0.5 or highest) with one of these PCs as significant terms.
In our example, the extracted significant terms from PC1 to PC4 are X3, X6
and X7.
3 Significant Sentence Extraction by SVD
3.1 SVD Overview and Its Application
We will give an outline of SVD adapted from [3,9] and how to make good use of
extracting the significant sentences.
Let A be any rectangular matrix, for instance an S ? T matrix of sentences
and terms, such as Table 2. The matrix A can be written as the product of an
S?R column-orthogonal matrix U , an R?R daigonal matrix W with positive or
zero elements (i.e., the singular values), and the transpose of a T ?R orthogonal
matrix V . Here, R is the rank of the matrix A (R ? min(S, T )). The SVD
decompositon is shown in Eq. (4).
A = U ? W ? V T (4)
where UT U = I, V T V = I, and W is the diagonal matrix of singualr val-
ues. In contrast to our usage of SVD, [3] used term-document matrix: our
Significant Sentence Extraction by Euclidean Distance 641
sentence-term matrix can be regarded as the transpose of term-document ma-
trix, since the documents can be thought of the sentences in the summarization
fields.
In this regard, the matrix A can be regarded as the sentence-term matrix
like Table 2, U as the sentence-concentrated matrix whose number of rows is
equal to the number of rows of the matrix A, and V as the term-concentrated
matrix whose number of rows is equal to the number of columns of the matrix
A. Then, the sentence vector si is defined as si = (ui1, ui2, ? ? ? , uiR) where R is
the rank of the matrix A. As before, the vector for a term tj is represented by
tj = (vj1, vj2, ? ? ? , vjR). Consequently, both the sentence and term vectors can
be used to calculate the distances between them.
Actually the reduced dimensionality can be used instead of the full rank, R,
by the cumulative ratio of the singular values. The cumulative ratio, ?k, can
be calculated by Eq. (5). When the ?k is more than 90%, k can be selected
for the reduced dimensionality. And this is large enough to capture most of the
important underlying structure in association of sentences and terms, and also
small enough to remove the noise of variability in term usage.
?k =
?k
i=1 wi
w1 + w2 + . . . + wR
, k = 1, 2, . . . , R (5)
To extract the significant sentences, in the first step, the Euclidean distances
can be computed between all the sentence vectors and the significant term vec-
tors (not all the term vectors). In this regard, the shorter the distance is, the
more important the sentence is, since the significant terms can be described as
representative words of a document. In the second step, the sentences are ex-
tracted by means of these Euclidean distances, and then these are included in
the summary in the order of their sequences. And the number of the included
sentences is depend on the compression rate of user?s need.
3.2 Extracting Significant Sentences by the Decomposed Matrices
In this subsection, we will illustrate how to extract the significant sentences by
examples. In [7], the importance of each sentence is computed by repeatedly
summing 1 for each occurrence of significant terms in the sentence. However,
the proposed method can be regarded as more formal or reasonable, since the
Euclidean distance between vectors is used to calculate the degree of importance
of each sentence.
Computing the SVD of the sentence-term matrix as shown in Table 2 re-
sults in the following three matrices for U ?, W ?, V ?. The matrices are reduced
by the cumulative ratio of the singular values computed by Eq. (5). Since the
first six singular values can justify 92.31% of the total, the 9-dimension can
be reduced to 6-dimension. Thus, the sentence-concentrated matrix, U ?, and
the term-concentrated matrix, V ?, can be represented only by 6-dimensional
vectors. The U ? and V ? are the vectors for the 9 sentences and 9 terms re-
spectively. The diagonal matrix W ? shows the first six values (originally, nine
values).

The Euclidean distances between the significant term vectors and the sen-
tence vectors can be computed by above two matrices, V ? and U ?, to extract
the significant sentences. The significant term vectors are the third, sixth and
seventh rows in the V ?. The significant sentence by X3, for instance, is the third
sentence of the document, since the distance between them is the shortest. All
the distances from X3, X6 and X7 vectors are shown in Table 4. Consequently,
the three significant sentences (third, fifth and sixth) can be included in the
summary of our sample article. When the number of the selected sentences are
less than that of user?s need, the summary can be supplemented with the other
sentences by their distances.
4 Experiments
We compared the proposed method with both only PCA[7] and random selection
of sentences.
The [7] selected the significant sentences by the appearance of the signifi-
cant terms. The [7] also exploited from one to three consecutive sentences for
the observation of PCA; however, the performance of extracting the significant
sentences was similar. In this paper, we used each sentence within a document
for the observation of PCA.
To extract sentences randomly, first, random numbers amounting to 30% of
the total number of sentences in a document were created, and then the sentences
were extracted by these random numbers.
We tried out the proposed method with two ways. First, the sentences were
extracted by the distances of each significant term as described in subsection

3.2. Second, the sentences were selected by all the distances of all the signif-
icant terms. In Table 5, ?All? and ?Each? denote the latter and the former,
respectively.
We used 127 documents of Korean newspaper articles for the evaluation,
which were compiled by KISTI(Korea Institute of Science & Technology In-
formation). Each document consists of orginal article and manual summary
amounting to 30% of the source text. We regarded the sentences within this
manual summary as correct ones.
We use three measures to evaluate the methods: precision, recall, and F-
measure. Let
? Count(SystemCorrect) denote the number of correct sentences that the sys-
tem extracts.
? Count(SystemExtract) denote the number of sentences that the system ex-
tracts.
? Count(Correct) denote the number of correct sentences provided in the test
collection.
The measures are defined respectively as follows.

Table 5 shows that, by means of F-measure, the proposed method has im-
proved the performance by about 2% ? 3.3% over only PCA, and by about 12%
? 13.3% over random selection. Table 5 also shows that the ?Each? method is
superior to ?All?. Furthermore, the performance of using PCA is better than
that of using term frequency or a thesaurus [7].
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we have proposed a summarization approach that constructs a
summary by extracting sentences in a single document. The particular tech-
niques used are PCA and SVD for extracting the significant terms and sentences
respectively.
PCA can quantify the information on both the term frequency and the term-
term cooccurrence in the document by the eigenvalue-eigenvector pairs. These
pairs were used to find out the significant terms among the nouns in the docu-
ment. In addition, these terms can be regarded as those extracted by relation-
ships between terms in the document, since PCA exploits the variance-covariance
structure.
In contrast to PCA, SVD has the inforamtion on the sentences and terms after
computing it of sentence-term matrix. In this regard, we can use the decomposed
matrices to calculate the distances between the sentence and term vectors, and
to make an effective removal of the noise of variability in term usage.
Experimental results on Korean newspaper articles show that the proposed
method is superior to the methods of both random selection and only using
PCA, and that extracting sentences by the distances per each term is better
performance than extracting by all the distances of all the terms.
In conclusion, the information on the cooccurrence relationships between
the terms by the PCA and the vector expressions of the sentences and terms
by the SVD can be helpful for the text summarization. Furthermore, the pro-
posed methods only exploited the pattern of the statistical occurrences within
a document without the additional resources like a thesaurus to find out the
relationships between the terms, and the proper dimension of the vectors.
