Abstract 
This paper reports about the development 
of a Named Entity Recognition (NER) sys-
tem for South and South East Asian lan-
guages, particularly for Bengali, Hindi, Te-
lugu, Oriya and Urdu as part of the 
IJCNLP-08 NER Shared Task
1
. We have 
used the statistical Conditional Random 
Fields (CRFs). The system makes use of 
the different contextual information of the 
words along with the variety of features 
that are helpful in predicting the various 
named entity (NE) classes. The system uses 
both the language independent as well as 
language dependent features. The language 
independent features are applicable for all 
the languages. The language dependent 
features have been used for Bengali and 
Hindi only. One of the difficult tasks of 
IJCNLP-08 NER Shared task was to iden-
tify the nested named entities (NEs) though 
only the type of the maximal NEs were 
given. To identify nested NEs, we have 
used rules that are applicable for all the 
five languages. In addition to these rules, 
gazetteer lists have been used for Bengali 
and Hindi. The system has been trained 
with Bengali (122,467 tokens), Hindi 
(502,974 tokens), Telugu (64,026 tokens), 
Oriya (93,173 tokens) and Urdu (35,447 
tokens) data. The system has been tested 
with the 30,505 tokens of Bengali, 38,708 
tokens of Hindi, 6,356 tokens of Telugu,

24,640 tokens of Oriya and 3,782 tokens of 
Urdu. Evaluation results have demonstrated 
the highest maximal F-measure of 53.36%, 
nested F-measure of 53.46% and lexical F-
measure of 59.39% for Bengali.   
1 Introduction 
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an impor-
tant tool in almost all Natural Language Proc-
essing (NLP) application areas. Proper identifi-
cation and classification of named entities are 
very crucial and pose a very big challenge to 
the NLP researchers. The level of ambiguity in 
named entity recognition (NER) makes it diffi-
cult to attain human performance.     
NER has drawn more and more attention 
from the named entity (NE) tasks (Chinchor 
95; Chinchor 98) in Message Understanding 
Conferences (MUCs) [MUC6; MUC7]. The 
problem of correct identification of named enti-
ties is specifically addressed and benchmarked 
by the developers of Information Extraction 
System, such as the GATE system (Cunning-
ham, 2001). NER also finds application in 
question-answering systems (Maldovan et al, 
2002) and machine translation (Babych and 
Hartley, 2003).  
The current trend in NER is to use the ma-
chine-learning approach, which is more attrac-
tive in that it is trainable and adoptable and the 
maintenance of a machine-learning system is 
much cheaper than that of a rule-based one. 
The representative machine-learning ap-
proaches used in NER are HMM (BBN?s Iden-
tiFinder in (Bikel, 1999)), Maximum Entropy 
33
(New York University?s MENE in (Borthwick, 
1999)), Decision Tree (New York University?s 
system in (Sekine 1998), SRA?s system in 
(Bennet, 1997) and Conditional Random Fields 
(CRFs) (Lafferty et al, 2001; McCallum and 
Li, 2003).       
There is no concept of capitalization in Indian 
languages (ILs) like English and this fact makes 
the NER task more difficult and challenging in 
ILs. There has been very little work in the area of 
NER in Indian languages. In Indian languages par-
ticularly in Bengali, the work in NER can be found 
in (Ekbal and Bandyopadhyay, 2007a) and  (Ekbal 
and Bandyopadhyay, 2007b). These two systems 
are based on the pattern directed shallow parsing 
approach. An HMM-based NER in Bengali can be 
found in (Ekbal et al, 2007c). Other than Bengali, 
the work on NER can be found in (Li and 
McCallum, 2004) for Hindi. This system is based 
on CRF.  
In this paper, we have reported a named entity 
recognition system for the south and south east 
Asian languages, particularly for Bengali, Hindi, 
Telugu, Oriya and Urdu. Bengali is the seventh 
popular language in the world, second in India and 
the national language of Bangladesh. Hindi is the 
third popular language in the world and the na-
tional language of India. Telugu is one of the popu-
lar languages and predominantly spoken in the 
southern part of India. Oriya and Urdu are the 
other two popular languages of India and widely 
used in the eastern and the northern part, respec-
tively. The statistical Conditional Random Field 
(CRF) model has been used to develop the system, 
as it is more efficient than HMM to deal with the 
non-independent and diverse overlapping features 
of the highly inflective Indian languages. We have 
used a fine-grained named entity tagset
2
, defined as 
part of the IJCNLP-08 NER Shared Task for 
SSEA. The system makes use of the different con-
textual information of the words along with the 
variety of orthographic word level features that are 
helpful in predicting the various named entity 
classes. In this work, we have considered language 
independent features as well as the language de-
pendent features. Language independent features 
include the contextual words, prefix and suffix in-
formation of all the words in the training corpus, 
several digit features depending upon the presence 
                                                
 
2
http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/ner-ssea-08/index.cgi?topic=3  
and/or the number of digits in a token and the fre-
quency features of the words. The system consid-
ers linguistic features particularly for Bengali and 
Hindi. Linguistic features of Bengali include the 
set of known suffixes that may appear with named 
entities, clue words that help in predicating the lo-
cation and organization names, words that help to 
recognize measurement expressions, designation 
words that help in identifying person names, the 
various gazetteer lists like the first names, middle 
names, last names, location names and organiza-
tion names. As part of linguistic features for Hindi, 
the system uses only the lists of first names, middle 
names and last names along with the list of words 
that helps to recognize measurements. No linguis-
tic features have been considered for Telugu, Oriya 
and Urdu. It has been observed from the evaluation 
results that the use of linguistic features improves 
the performance of the system. A number of ex-
periments have been carried out to find out the 
best-suited set of features for named entity recog-
nition in Bengali, Hindi, Telugu, Oriya and Urdu.  
2 Conditional Random Fields 
Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al, 
2001) are undirected graphical models, a special 
case of which corresponds to conditionally trained 
probabilistic finite state automata. Being 
conditionally trained, these CRFs can easily 
incorporate a large number of arbitrary, non-
independent features while still having efficient 
procedures for non-greedy finite-state inference 
and training. CRFs have shown success in various 
sequence modeling tasks including noun phrase 
segmentation (Sha and Pereira, 2003) and table 
extraction (Pinto et al, 2003).     
CRFs are used to calculate the conditional 
probability of values on designated output nodes 
given values on other designated input nodes. The 
conditional probability of a state sequence 
1, 2, , TS s s s given an observation 
sequence 1 2,, ....., )TO o o o  is calculated as: 
1 ,
1
1
( | ) exp( ( , , )),
T
k k t t
o
t k
P s o f s s o t
Z
where
1 ,( , , )k t tf s s o t is a feature function whose weight 
k is to be learned via training. The values of the 
feature functions may range between ..... , 
but typically they are binary. To make all 
34
conditional probabilities sum up to 1, we must 
calculate the normalization 
factor, 0 1 ,
1
exp( ( , , ))
T
s k k t t
t k
Z f s s o t , 
which, as in HMMs, can be obtained efficiently by 
dynamic programming. 
To train a CRF, the objective function to be 
maximized is the penalized log-likelihood of the 
state sequences given observation sequences: 
2
( ) ( )
2
1
log( ( | ))
2
N
i i
k
i k
L P s o , 
where, {
( ) ( )
,
i i
o s } is the labeled training 
data. The second sum corresponds to a zero-mean,  
2
-variance Gaussaian prior over parameters, 
which facilitates optimization by making the like-
lihood surface strictly convex. Here, we set pa-
rameters 
 
to maximize the penalized log-
likelihood using Limited-memory BFGS (Sha and 
Pereira, 2003), a quasi-Newton method that is sig-
nificantly more efficient, and which results in only 
minor changes in accuracy due to changes in .  
When applying CRFs to the named entity 
recognition problem, an obsevation sequence is a 
token of a sentence or document of text and the 
state sequence is its corresponding label sequence. 
While CRFs generally can use real-valued 
functions, in our experiments maximum of the 
features are binary. A feature function 
1 ,( , , )k t tf s s o t has a value of 0 for most cases and 
is only set to be 1, when 1,t ts s are certain states 
and the observation has certain properties. We 
have used the C
++ 
based OpenNLP CRF++ pack-
age
3
, a simple, customizable, and open source im-
plementation of Conditional Random Fields 
(CRFs) for segmenting /labeling sequential data. 
3 Named Entity Recognition in Indian 
Languages 
Named Entity Recognition in Indian languages 
(ILs) is difficult and challenging as capitalization 
is not a clue in ILs. The training data were pro-
vided for five different Indian languages, namely 
Bengali, Hindi, Telugu, Oriya and Urdu in Shakti 
Standard Format
4
. The training data in all the lan-
                                                
3

http://shiva.iiit.ac.in/SPSAL 2007/ssf.html  
guages were annotated with the twelve NE tags, as 
defined for the IJCNLP-08 NER shared task taget
5
. 
Only the maximal named entities and not the inter-
nal structures of the entities were annotated in the 
training data. For example, mahatma gandhi road 
was annotated as location and assigned the tag 
?NEL? even if mahatma and gandhi  are named 
entity title person (NETP) and person name (NEP) 
respectively, according to the IJCNLP-08 shared 
task tagset. These internal structures of the entities 
were to be identified during testing. So, mahatma 
gandhi road will be tagged as mahatma /NETP 
gandhi/NEP road/NEL. The structure of the tagged 
element using the SSF form will be as follows:  
1 (( NP <ne=NEL>  
1.1 (( NP <ne=NEP> 
1.1.1 (( NP  <ne=NETP> 
1.1.1.1 mahatma 
)) 
1.1.2 gandhi 
)) 
1.2 road 
)) 
3.1 Training Data Preparation for CRF  
Training data for all the languages required some 
preprocessing in order to use in the Conditional 
Random Field framework. The training data is 
searched for the multiword NEs. Each component 
of the multiword NE is searched in the training set 
to find whether it occurs as a single-word NE. The 
constituent components are then replaced by their 
NE tags (NE type of the single-word NE). For ex-
ample, mahatma gandhi road/NEL will be tagged 
as mahatma/NETP gandhi/NEP road/NEL if the 
internal components are found to appear with these 
NE tags in the training set. Each component of a 
multiword NE is also checked whether the compo-
nent is made up of digits only. If a component is 
made up digits only, then it is assigned the tag 
?NEN?. Various gazetteers for Bengali and Hindi 
have been also used in order to identify the internal 
structure of the NEs properly.  The list of gazet-
teers, which have been used in preparing the train-
ing data, is shown in Table 1. 
The individual components (not occurring as a 
single-word NE in the training data) of a multi-
word NE are searched in the gazetteer lists and

assigned the appropriate NE tags. Other than NEs 
are marked with the NNE tags. The procedure is 
given below:  
Gazetteer list Number of entries 
First person name in Ben-
gali 
27,842 
Last person name in Ben-
gali 
5,288 
Middle name in Bengali 1,491 
Person name designation

947 
Location name in Bengali 7,870 
First person name in Hindi 1,62,881 
Last person name in Hindi 3,573 
Middle name in Hindi 450 
Cardinals in Bengali,

urement in Bengali, Hindi

Table 1. Gazetteer lists used during training data 
preparation  
 Step 1: Search the multiword NE in the training 
data 
Step 2: Extract each component from the mult-
word NE. 
Step 3: Check whether the constituent individual 
component (except the last one) appears in the 
training data as a single-word NE. 
Step 4: If the constituent NE appears in the training 
data as a single-word NE then 
Step 4.1: Assign the NE tag, extracted from the 
single-word NE, to the component of the multi-
word NE. 
else 
Step 4.2: Search the component in the gazetteer 
lists and assign the appropriate NE tag. 
Step 4.2.1: If the component is not found to appear 
in the gazetteer list then assign the NE tag of the 
maximal NE to the individual component.  
For example, if mahatma gandhi road is tagged 
as NEL, i.e., mahatma gandhi road/NEL then each 
component except the last one (road ) of this mult-
word NE is searched in the training set to look for 
it?s appearance (Step 3). Gazetteer lists are 
searched in case the component is not found in the 
training set (Step 4.2). If the components are found 
either in the training set or in the gazetteer list, 
then mahatma gandhi road/NEL will be tagged as: 
mahatma/NETP gandhi/NEP road/NEL. 
3.2 Named Entity Features 
Feature selection plays a crucial role in CRF 
framework. Experiments were carried out to find 
out most suitable features for NE tagging task. The 
main features for the NER task have been identi-
fied based on the different possible combination of 
available word and tag context. The features also 
include prefix and suffix for all words. The term 
prefix/suffix is a sequence of first/last few charac-
ters of a word, which may not be a linguistically 
meaningful prefix/suffix. The use of prefix/suffix 
information works well for highly inflected lan-
guages like the Indian languages. In addition, vari-
ous gazetteer lists have been developed to use in 
the NER task particularly for Bengali and Hindi. 
We have considered different combination from 
the following set for inspecting the best feature set 
for the NER task: 
 F={
1 1
,..., , , ,...,
i m i i i i n
w w w w w , |prefix| n, 
|suffix| n, previous NE tag, POS tags, First word, 
Digit information, Gazetteer lists} 
     Following is the details of the set of features 
that were applied to the NER task: 
 
Context word feature: Previous and next words 
of a particular word might be used as a feature. We 
have considered the word window of size five, i.e., 
previous and next two words from the current word 
for all the languages.  
Word suffix: Word suffix information is helpful 
to identify NEs. A fixed length word suffix of the 
current and surrounding words might be treated as 
feature. In this work, suffixes of length up to three 
the current word have been considered for all the 
languages. More helpful approach is to modify the 
feature as binary feature. Variable length suffixes 
of a word can be matched with predefined lists of 
useful suffixes for different classes of NEs. For 
Bengali, we have considered the different suffixes 
that may be particularly helpful in detecting person 
(e.g., -babu, -da, -di etc.). 
36
Word prefix: Prefix information of a word is also 
helpful. A fixed length prefix of the current and the 
surrounding words might be treated as features. 
Here, the prefixes of length up to three have been 
considered for all the language. 
Rare word: The lists of most frequently occurring 
words in the training sets have been calculated for 
all the five languages. The words that occur more 
than 10 times are considered as the frequently oc-
curring words in Bengali and Hindi. For Telugu, 
Oriya and Urdu, the cutoff frequency was chosen 
to be 5. Now, a binary feature ?RareWord? is de-
fined as: If current word is found to appear in the 
frequent word list then it is set to 1; otherwise, set 
to 0.   
First word: If the current token is the first word of 
a sentence, then this feature is set to 1. Otherwise, 
it is set to 0. 
Contains digit: For a token, if it contains digit(s) 
then the feature ?ContainsDigit? is set to 1. This 
feature is helpful for identifying the numbers.  
Made up of four digits: For a token if all the char-
acters are digits and having 4 digits then the fea-
ture ?FourDigit? is set to 1. This is helpful in iden-
tifying the time (e.g., 2007sal) and numerical (e.g., 
2007) expressions. 
Made up of two digits: For a token if all the char-
acters are digits and having 2 digits then the fea-
ture ?TwoDigit? is set to 1. This is helpful for iden-
tifying the time expressions (e.g., 12 ta, 8 am, 9 pm) 
in general. 
Contains digits and comma: For a token, if it con-
tains digits and commas then the feature ?Con-
tainsDigitsAndComma? is set to 1. This feature is 
helpful in identifying named entity measurement 
expressions (e.g., 120,45,330 taka) and numerical 
numbers (e.g., 120,45,330) 
Contains digits and slash: If the token contains 
digits and slash then the feature ?ContainsDigi-
tAndslash? is set to 1. This helps in identifying 
time expressions (e.g., 15/8/2007). 
Contains digits and hyphen: If the token contains 
digits and hyphen then the feature ?ContainsDigit-
sAndHyphen? is set to 1. This is helpful for the 
identification of time expressions (e.g., 15-8-2007). 
Contains digits and period: If the token contains 
digits and periods then the feature ?ContainsDigit-
sAndPeriod? is set to 1. This helps to recognize 
numerical quantities (e.g., 120453.35) and meas-
urements (e.g., 120453.35 taka). 
Contains digits and percentage: If the token con-
tains digits and percentage symbol then the feature 
?ContainsDigitsAndPercentage? is set to 1. This 
helps to recognize measurements (e.g., 120%). 
Named Entity Information: The NE tag of the 
previous word is also considered as the feature, i.e., 
the combination of the current and the previous 
output token has been considered. This is the only 
dynamic feature in the experiment. 
Gazetteer Lists: Various gazetteer lists have been 
created from a tagged Bengali news corpus (Ekbal 
and Bandyopadhyay, 2007d) for Bengali. The first, 
last and middle names of person for Hindi have 
been created from the election commission data
6
. 
The person name collections had to be processed in 
order to use it in the CRF framework. The simplest 
approach of using these gazetteers is to compare 
the current word with the lists and make decisions. 
But this approach is not good, as it can?t resolve 
ambiguity. So, it is better to use these lists as the 
features of the CRF. If the current token is in a par-
ticular list, then the corresponding feature is set to 
1 for the current/previous/next token; otherwise, 
set to 0. The list of gazetteers is shown in Table 2. 
3.3 Nested Named Entity Identification 
One of the important tasks of the IJCNLP-NER 
shared task was to identify the internal named enti-
ties within the maximal NEs. In the training data, 
only the type of the maximal NEs were given. In 
order to identify the internal NEs during testing, 
we have defined some rules. After testing the un-
annotated test data with the CRF based NER sys-
tem, it is searched to find the sequence of NE tags. 
The last NE tag in the sequence is assigned as the 
NE tag of the maximal NE. The NE tags of the 
constituent NEs may either be changed or may not 
be changed. The NE tags are changed with the help 
of rules and various gazetteer lists. We identified 
NEM (Named entity measurement), NETI (Named 
entity time expressions), NEO (Named entity or-
ganization names), NEP (Named entity person 
names) and NEL (Named entity locations) to be 
the potential NE tags, where nesting could occur. 
A NEM expression may contain NEN, an NETI 
may contain NEN, an NEO may contain NEP/ 
NEL, an NEL may contain NEP/NETP/NED and 
an NEP may contain NEL expressions. The nested

NEN tags could be identified by simply checking 
whether it contains digits only and checking the 
lists of cardinal and ordinal numbers.

 Table 2. Named entity gazetteer list   
The procedure for identifying the nested NEs are 
shown below: 
Step1: Test the unannotated test set. 
Step 2: Look for the sequence of NE tags. 
Step 3: All the words in the sequence will belong     
to a maximal NE. 
Step 4: Assign the last NE tag in the sequence to 
the maximal NE. 
Step 5: The test set is searched to look whether 
each component word appears with a NE tag.  
Step 6: Assign the particular NE tag to the compo-
nent if it appears in the test set with that NE tag. 
Otherwise, search the gazetteer lists as shown in 
Tables 1-2 to assign the tag. 
4 Evaluation 
The evaluation measures used for all the five lan-
guages are precision, recall and F-measure. These 
measures are calculated in three different ways: 
(i). Maximal matches: The largest possibles 
named entities are matched with the reference data. 
(ii). Nested matches: The largest possible as 
well as nested named entities are matched. 
(iii). Maximal lexical item matches: The lexical 
items inside the largest possible named entities are 
matched. 
(iv). Nested lexical item matches: The lexical 
items inside the largest possible as well as nested 
named entities are matched.  
5 Experimental Results 
The CRF based NER system has been trained and 
tested with five different Indian languages namely, 
Bengali, Hindi, Telugu, Oriya and Urdu data.  The 
training and test sets statistics are presented in Ta-
ble 3. Results of evaluation as explained in the 
previous section are shown in Table 4. The F-
measures for the nested lexical match are also 
shown individually for each named entity tag sepa-
rately in Table 5. 
Experimental results of Table 4 show that the 
CRF based NER system performs best for Bengali 
with maximal F-measure of 55.36%, nested F-
measure of 61.46% and lexical F-measure 59.39%. 
The system has demonstrated the F-measures of 
35.37%, 36.75% and 33.12%, respectively for 
maximal, nested and lexical matches. The system 
has shown promising precision values for Hindi. 
But due to the low recall values, the F-measures 
get reduced. The large difference between the re-
call and precision values in the evaluation results 
of Hindi indicates that the system is not able to 
retrieve a significant number of NEs from the test 
38
data. In comparison to Hindi, the precision values 
are low and the recall values are high for Bengali. 
It can be decided from the evaluation results that 
system retrieves more NEs in Bengali than Hindi 
but involves more errors. The lack of features in 
Oriya, Telugu and Urdu might be the reason be-
hind their poor performance.

Table 4. Evaluation for Specific NE Tags (F-
Measures for nested lexical match) [NF: Nothing 
found]  
Experimental results of Table 5 show the F-
measures for the nested lexical item matches for 
individual NE tags. For Bengali, the system has 
shown reasonably high F-measures for NEP, NEL 
and NEM tags and medium F-measures for NETP, 
NETI, NEO and NETO tags. The overall F-
measures in Bengali might have reduced due to 
relatively poor F-measures for NETE, NEN, NEA 
and NED tags. For Hindi, the highest F-measure 
obtained is 85.4% for NEN tag followed by NETI, 
NED, NEM, NEA, NEL and NEP tags. In some 
cases, the system has shown better F-measures for 
Hindi than Bengali also. The system has performed 
better for NEN, NED and NEA tags in Hindi than 
all other languages. 
6 Conclusion  
We have developed a named entity recognition 
system using Conditional Random Fields for the 
five different Indian languages, namely Bengali, 
Hindi, Telugu, Oriya and Urdu. We have consid-
ered the contextual window of size five, prefix and 
suffix of length upto three of the current word, NE 
information of the previous word, different digit 
features and the frequently occurring word lists. 
The system also uses linguistic features extracted 
from the various gazetteer lists for Bengali and 
Hindi. Evaluation results show that the system per-
forms best for Bengali. The performance of the 
system for Bengali can further be improved by in-
cluding the part of speech (POS) information of the 
current and/or the surrounding word(s). The per-
formance of the system for other languages can be 
improved with the use of different linguistic fea-
tures as like Bengali.  
The system did not perform as expected due to 
the problems faced during evaluation regarding the 
tokenization. We have tested the system for Ben-
gali with 10-fold cross validation and obtained im-
pressive results.
