Abstract
Question classification plays an important role
in question answering. Features are the key to
obtain an accurate question classifier. In con-
trast to Li and Roth (2002)?s approach which
makes use of very rich feature space, we pro-
pose a compact yet effective feature set. In
particular, we propose head word feature and
present two approaches to augment semantic
features of such head words using WordNet.
In addition, Lesk?s word sense disambigua-
tion (WSD) algorithm is adapted and the depth
of hypernym feature is optimized. With fur-
ther augment of other standard features such
as unigrams, our linear SVM and Maximum
Entropy (ME) models reach the accuracy of
89.2% and 89.0% respectively over a standard
benchmark dataset, which outperform the best
previously reported accuracy of 86.2%.
1 Introduction
An important step in question answering (QA) and
other dialog systems is to classify the question to
the anticipated type of the answer. For example, the
question of Who discovered x-rays should be classi-
fied into the type of human (individual). This infor-
mation would narrow down the search space to iden-
tify the correct answer string. In addition, this infor-
mation can suggest different strategies to search and
verify a candidate answer. For instance, the classifi-
cation of question What is autism to a definition type
question would trigger the search strategy specific
for definition type (e.g., using predefined templates
like: Autism is ... or Autism is defined as...). In fact,
the combination of QA and the named entity recog-
nition is a key approach in modern question answer-
ing systems (Voorhees and Dang, 2005).
The question classification is by no means trivial:
Simply using question wh-words can not achieve
satisfactory results. The difficulty lies in classify-
ing the what and which type questions. Considering
the example What is the capital of Yugoslavia, it is
of location (city) type, while What is the pH scale
is of definition type. Considering also examples (Li
and Roth, 2006) What tourist attractions are there in
Reims, What are the names of the tourist attractions
in Reims, What do most tourists visit in Reims, What
attracts tourists to Reims, and What is worth seeing
in Reims, all these reformulations are of the same
answer type of location. Different wording and syn-
tactic structures make it difficult for classification.
Many QA systems used manually constructed sets
of rules to map a question to a type, which is not effi-
cient in maintain and upgrading. With the increasing
popularity of statistical approaches, machine learn-
ing plays a more and more important role in this
task. A salient advantage of machine learning ap-
proach is that one can focus on designing insightful
features, and rely on learning process to efficiently
and effectively cope with the features. In addition, a
learned classifier is more flexible to reconstruct than
a manually constructed system because it can be
trained on a new taxonomy in a very short time. Ear-
lier question classification work includes Pinto et al
(2002) and Radev et at. (2002), in which language
model and Rappier rule learning were employed
respectively. More recently, Li and Roth (2002)
have developed a machine learning approach which
uses the SNoW learning architecture (Khardon et al,
927
1999). They have compiled the UIUC question clas-
sification dataset 1 which consists of 5500 training
and 500 test questions. The questions in this dataset
are collected from four sources: 4,500 English ques-
tions published by USC (Hovy et al, 2001), about
500 manually constructed questions for a few rare
classes, 894 TREC 8 and TREC 9 questions, and
also 500 questions from TREC 10 which serve as the
test dataset. All questions in the dataset have been
manually labeled by them according to the coarse
and fine grained categories as shown in Table 3, with
coarse classes (in bold) followed by their fine class
refinements. In addition, the table shows the dis-
tribution of the 500 test questions over such cate-
gories. Li and Roth (2002) have made use of lexical
words, part of speech tags, chunks (non-overlapping
phrases), head chunks (the first noun chunk in a
question) and named entities. They achieved 78.8%
accuracy for 50 fine grained classes. With a hand-
built dictionary of semantically related words, their
system is able to reach 84.2%.
The UIUC dataset has laid a platform for the
follow-up research. Hacioglu and Ward (2003) used
linear support vector machines with question word
bigrams and error-correcting output to obtain accu-
racy of 80.2% to 82.0%. Zhang and Lee (2003)
used linear SVMs with all possible question word
grams, and obtained accuracy of 79.2%. Later Li
and Roth (2006) used more semantic information
sources including named entities, WordNet senses,
class-specific related words, and distributional sim-
ilarity based categories in question classification
task. With all these semantic features plus the syn-
tactic ones, their model was trained on 21?500 ques-
tions and was able to achieve the best accuracy of
89.3% on a test set of 1000 questions (taken from
TREC 10 and TREC 11) for 50 fine classes. Most
recently, Krishnan et al (2005) used a short (typ-
ically one to three words) subsequence of question
tokens as features for question classification. Their
model can reach the accuracy of 86.2% using UIUC
dataset over fine grained question categories, which
is the highest reported accuracy on UIUC dataset.
In contrast to Li and Roth (2006)?s approach
which makes use of a very rich feature set, we
propose to use a compact yet effective feature set.
In particular, we propose head word feature and

present two approaches to augment semantic fea-
tures of such head words using WordNet. In addi-
tion, Lesk?s word sense disambiguation (WSD) al-
gorithm is adapted and the depth of hypernym fea-
ture is optimized. With further augment of other
standard features such as unigrams, we can obtain
accuracy of 89.2% using linear SVMs, or 89.0% us-
ing ME for 50 fine classes.
2 Classifiers
In this section, we briefly present two classifiers,
support vector machines and maximum entropy
model, which will be employed in our experiments.
These two classifiers perform roughly identical in
the question classification task.
2.1 Support Vector Machines
Support vector machine (Vapnik, 1995) is a useful
technique for data classification. Given a training set
of instance-labeled pairs (xi, yi), i = 1, . . . , l where
xi ? Rn and y ? {1,?1}l , the support vector ma-
chines (SVM) require the solution of the following
optimization problem: minw,b,? 12wTw+C
?l
i=1 ?i
subject to yi(wT?(xi) + b) ? 1 ? ?i and ?i ? 0.
Here training vectors xi are mapped into a higher
(maybe infinite) dimensional space by the function
?. Then SVM finds a linear separating hyperplane
with the maximal margin in this higher dimensional
space. C > 0 is the penalty parameter of the er-
ror term. Furthermore, K(xi,xj) ? ?(xi)T?(xi) is
called the kernel function. There are four basic ker-
nels: linear, polynomial, radial basis function, and
sigmoid. In the question classification context, xi
is represented by a set of binary features, for in-
stance, the presence or absence of particular words.
yi ? {1,?1} indicates wether a question is of a
particular type or not. Due to the large number of
features in question classification, one may not need
to map data to a higher dimensional space. It has
been commonly accepted that the linear kernel of
K(xi,xj) = xiTxi is good enough for question
classification. In this paper, we adopt the LIBSVM
(Chang and Lin, 2001) implementation in our exper-
iments.
2.2 Maximum Entropy Models
Maximum entropy (ME) models (Berger et al,
1996; Manning and Klein, 2003), also known as
928
log-linear and exponential learning models, provide
a general purpose machine learning technique for
classification and prediction which has been suc-
cessfully applied to natural language processing in-
cluding part of speech tagging, named entity recog-
nition etc. Maximum entropy models can inte-
grate features from many heterogeneous informa-
tion sources for classification. Each feature corre-
sponds to a constraint on the model. In the context of
question classification, a sample feature could be the
presence of a particular word associated with a par-
ticular question type. The maximum entropy model
is the model with maximum entropy of all models
that satisfy the constraints. In this paper, we adopt
Stanford Maximum Entropy (Manning and Klein,
2003) implementation in our experiments.
3 Features
Each question is represented as a bag of features
and is feeded into classifiers in training stage. We
present five binary feature sets, namely question wh-
word, head word, WordNet semantic features for
head word, word grams, and word shape feature.
The five feature sets will be separately used by the
classifiers to determine their individual contribution.
In addition, these features are used in an incremental
fashion in our experiments.
3.1 Question wh-word
The wh-word feature is the question wh-word in
given questions. For example, the wh-word of
question What is the population of China is what.
We have adopted eight question wh-words, namely
what, which, when, where, who, how, why, and rest,
with rest being the type does not belong to any of
the previous type. For example, the question Name
a food high in zinc is a rest type question.
3.2 Head Word
Li and Roth (2002;2006) used head chunks as fea-
tures. The first noun chunk and the first verb chunk
after the question word in a sentence are defined
as head chunks in their approach. Krishnan et al
(2005) used one contiguous span of tokens which is
denoted as the informer span as features. In both
approaches, noisy information could be introduced.
For example, considering the question of What is a
group of turkeys called, both the head chunk and in-
former span of this question is group of turkeys. The
word of turkeys in the chunk (or span) contributes to
the classification of type ENTY:animal if the hyper-
nyms of WordNet are employed (as described in next
section). However, the extra word group would in-
troduce ambiguity to misclassify such question into
HUMAN:group, as all words appearing in chunk are
treated equally. To tackle this problem, we pro-
pose the feature of head word, which is one single
word specifying the object that the question seeks.
In the previous example What is a group of turkeys
called, the head word is exactly turkeys. In doing
so, no misleading word group is augmented. An-
other example is George Bush purchased a small in-
terest in which baseball team. The head chunk, in-
former span and head word are baseball team, base-
ball team and team respectively. The extra word
baseball in the head chunk and informer span may
lead the question misclassified as ENTY:sport rather
than HUM:group. In most cases, the head chunk
or informer span include head words. The head
chunk feature or informer span feature would be
beneficiary so long as the useful information plays a
stronger role than the misleading one. Nevertheless,
this is not as effective as the introduction of one head
word.
To obtain the head word feature, a syntactic parser
is required. A syntactic parser is a model that out-
puts the grammatical structure of given sentences.
There are accurate parsers available such as Cha-
niak parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005), Stan-
ford parser (Klein and Manning, 2003) and Berkeley
parser (Petrov and Klein, 2007), among which we
use the Berkeley parser 2 to help identify the head
word. Figure 1 shows two example parse trees for
questions What year did the Titanic sink and What is
the sales tax in Minnesota respectively.
Collins rules (Collins, 1999) can be applied to
parse trees to extract the syntactic head words. For
example, the WHNP phrase (Wh-noun phrase) in
the top of Figure 1 takes its WP child as its head
word, thus assigning the word what (in the bracket)
which is associated with WP tag to the syntactic
head word of WHNP phrase. Such head word as-
signment is carried out from the bottom up and the
word did is extracted as the head word of the whole
question. Similarly, the word is is extracted as the

syntactic head word in the bottom of Figure 1.
Collins head words finder rules have been modi-
fied to extract semantic head word (Klein and Man-
ning, 2003). To better cover the question sentences,
we further re-define the semantic head finder rules
to fit our needs. In particular, the rules to find the
semantic head word of phrases SBARQ (Clause in-
troduced by subordinating conjunction), SQ (sub-
constituent of SBARQ excluding wh-word or wh-
phrase), VP (verb phrase) and SINV (declarative
sentence with subject-aux inversion) are redefined,
with the head preference of noun or noun phrase
rather than verb or verb phrase. The new head
word assignments for the previous two examples are
shown in Figure 2.
If the head word is any of name, type or kind etc,
post fix is required to identify the real head word if
necessary. In particular, we compile a tree pattern
as shown in the left of Figure 3. If this pattern is
matched against a given parse question parse tree,
the head word is re-assigned to the head word of NP
node in the tree pattern. For example, the initial head
word extracted from parse tree of question What is
the proper name for a female walrus is name. As
such parse tree (as shown partially in the right of
Figure 3) matches the compiled tree pattern, the post
operation shall fix it to walrus, which is the head
word of the NP in the tree pattern. This post fix helps
classify the question to ENTY:animal.

In addition to the question head word as described
above, we introduce a few regular expression pat-
terns to help question head word identification. Note
that these patterns depend on the question type tax-
onomy as shown in Table 3. For example, consid-
ering the questions of What is an atom and What
are invertebrates, the head word of atom and in-
vertebrates do not help classify such questions to
DESC:def. To resolve this, we create a binary fea-
ture using a string regular expression which begins
with what is/are and follows by an optional a, an, or
the and then follows by one or two words. If a ques-
tion matches this regular expression, a binary feature
(a placeholder word is used in implementation, for
instance DESC:def 1 in this case) would be inserted
to the feature set of the question. This feature, if it
is beneficial, would be picked up by the classifiers
(SVMs or MEs) in training. We list all regular ex-
pression patterns which are used in our experiments
as following:
DESC:def pattern 1 The question begins with what is/are and follows
930
by an optional a, an, or the and then follows by one or two words.
DESC:def pattern 2 The question begins with what do/does and ends
with mean.
ENTY:substance pattern The question begins with what is/are and
ends with composed of/made of/made out of.
DESC:desc pattern The question begins with what does and ends
with do.
ENTY:term The question begins with what do you call.
DESC:reason pattern 1 The question begins with what causes/cause.
DESC:reason pattern 2 The question begins with What is/are and
ends with used for.
ABBR:exp pattern The question begins with What does/do and ends
with stand for.
HUM:desc pattern The question begins with Who is/was and follows
by a word starting with a capital letter.
It is worth noting that all these patterns serve as
feature generators for given questions: the feature
becomes active if the pattern matches the ques-
tions. The algorithm to extract question head word
is shown in Algorithm 1. There is no head word
returned for when, where or why type questions, as
these hw-words are informative enough; the inclu-
sion of other words would introduce noisy informa-
tion. If the question is of type how, the word follow-
ing how is returned as head word. The patterns are
then attempted to match the question if it is of type
what or who. If there is a match, the placehold word
for such pattern (e.g., HUM:desc for HUM:desc pat-
tern) is returned as head word. If none of the above
condition is met, the candidate head word is ex-
tracted from the question parse tree using the rede-
fined head finder rules. Such extracted head word is
returned only if it has noun or noun phrase tag; oth-
erwise the first word which has noun or noun phrase
tag is returned. The last step is a back up plan in
case none of the previous procedure happens.
3.3 WordNet Semantic Feature
WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is a large English lexicon
in which meaningfully related words are connected
via cognitive synonyms (synsets). The WordNet is
a useful tool for word semantics analysis and has
been widely used in question classification (Krish-
nan et al, 2005; Schlaefer et al, 2007). A natural
way to use WordNet is via hypernyms: Y is a hy-
pernym of X if every X is a (kind of) Y. For exam-
ple, the question of What breed of hunting dog did

the Beverly Hillbillies own requires the knowledge
of animal being the hypernym of dog. In this paper,
we propose two approaches to augment WordNet se-
mantic features, with the first augmenting the hyper-
nyms of head words as extracted in previous section
directly, and the second making use of a WordNet
similarity package (Seco et al, 2004), which implic-
itly employs the structure of hypernyms.
3.3.1 Direct Use of Hypernyms
In WordNet, senses are organized into hierarchies
with hypernym relationships, which provides a nat-
ural way to augment hypernyms features from the
original head word. For example, the hierarchies for
a noun sense of domestic dog is described as: dog
? domestic animal ? animal, while another noun
sense (a dull unattractive unpleasant girl or woman)
is organized as dog ? unpleasant woman ? un-
pleasant person. In addition, a verb sense of dog is
organized as dog ? pursue ? travel. In our first ap-
proach, we attempt to directly introduce hypernyms
for the extracted head words. The augment of hyper-
nyms for given head word can introduce useful in-
formation, but can also bring noise if the head word
or the sense of head word are not correctly identi-
fied. To resolve this, three questions shall be ad-
dressed: 1) which part of speech senses should be
augmented? 2) which sense of the given word is
needed to be augmented? and 3) how many depth
931
are required to tradeoff the generality (thus more
informative) and the specificity (thus less noisy).
The first question can be answered by mapping
the Penn Treebank part of speech tag of the given
head word to its WordNet part of speech tag, which
is one of POS.NOUN, and POS.ADJECTIVE,
POS.ADVERB and POS.VERB. The second ques-
tion is actually a word sense disambiguation (WSD)
problem. The Lesk algorithm (Lesk, 1986) is a clas-
sical algorithm for WSD. It is based on the assump-
tion that words in a given context will tend to share
a common topic. A basic implementation of the The
Lesk algorithm is described as following:
1. Choosing pairs of ambiguous words within a
context
2. Checks their definitions in a dictionary
3. Choose the senses as to maximize the number
of common terms in the definitions of the cho-
sen words
In our head word sense disambiguation, the context
words are words (except the head word itself) in the
question, and the dictionary is the gloss of a sense
for a given word. Algorithm 2 shows the adapted
Lesk algorithm which is employed in our system.
Basically, for each sense of given head word, this
Algorithm 2 Head word sense disambiguation
Require: Question q and its head word h
Ensure: Disambiguated sense for h
1: int count = 0
2: int maxCount = -1
3: sense optimum = null
4: for each sense s for h do
5: count = 0
6: for each context word w in q do
7: int subMax = maximum number of common words in s
definition (gloss) and definition of any sense of w
8: count = count + sumMax
9: end for
10: if count > maxCount then
11: maxCount = count
12: optimum = s
13: end if
14: end for
15: return optimum
algorithm computes the maximum number of com-
mon words between gloss of this sense and gloss of
any sense of the context words. Among all head
word senses, the sense which results in the maxi-
mum common words is chosen as the optimal sense
to augment hypernyms later. Finally the third ques-
tion is answered via trail and error based on evaluat-
ing randomly generated 10% data from the training
dataset. Generally speaking, if the identification of
the head word is not accurate, it would brings signif-
icant noisy information. Our experiments show that
the use of depth six produces the best results over
the validation dataset. This indirectly proves that our
head word feature is very accurate: the hypernyms
introduction within six depths would otherwise pol-
lute the feature space.
3.3.2 Indirect Use of Hypernyms
In this approach, we make use of the WordNet
Similarity package (Seco et al, 2004), which im-
plicitly employs WordNet hypernyms. In particu-
lar, for a given pair of words, the WordNet similar-
ity package models the length of path traveling from
one word to the other over the WordNet network.
It then computes the semantic similarity based on
the path. For example, the similarity between car
and automobile is 1.0, while the similarity between
film and audience is 0.38. For each question, we
use the WordNet similarity package to compute the
similarity between the head word of such question
and each description word in a question categoriza-
tion. The description words for a question category
are a few words (usually one to three) which explain
the semantic meaning of such a question category
3
. For example, the descriptions words for category
ENTY:dismed are diseases and medicine. The ques-
tion category which has the highest similarity to the
head word is marked as a feature. This is equal to
a mini question classifier. For example, as the head
word walrus of question What is the proper name
for a female walrus has the highest similarity mea-
sure to animals, which is a description word of cat-
egory ENTY:animal, thus the ENTY:animal is in-
serted into the feature set of the given question.
3.4 N-Grams
An N-gram is a sub-sequence of N words from a
given question. Unigram forms the bag of words
feature, and bigram forms the pairs of words fea-
ture, and so forth. We have considered unigram, bi-
gram, and trigram features in our experiments. The
reason to use such features is to provide word sense
3available at http://12r.cs.uiuc.edu/?cogcomp/Data/QA/QC
/definition.html
932
disambiguation for questions such as How long did
Rip Van Winkle sleep, as How long (captured by
wh-word and head word features) could refer to ei-
ther NUM:dist or NUM:period. The word feature of
sleep help determine the NUM:period classification.
3.5 Word Shape
Word shape in a given question may be useful for
question classification. For instance, the question
Who is Duke Ellington has a mixed shape (begins a
with capital letter and follows by lower case letters)
for Duke, which roughly serves as a named entity
recognizer. We use five word shape features, namely
all upper case, all lower case, mixed case, all digits,
and other. The experiments show that this feature
slightly boosts the accuracy.
4 Experimental Results
We designed two experiments to test the accuracy
of our classifiers. The first experiment evaluates the
individual contribution of different feature types to
question classification accuracy. In particular, the
SVM and ME are trained from the UIUC 5500 train-
ing data using the following feature sets: 1) wh-
word + head word, 2) wh-word + head word + direct
hypernym, 3) wh-wod + head word + indirect hyper-
nym, 4) unigram, 5) bigram, 6) trigram, and 7) word
shape. We set up the tests of 1), 2) and 3) due to the
fact that wh-word and head word can be treated as a
unit, and hypernym depends on head word. In the
second experiment, feature sets are incrementally
feeded to the SVM and ME. The parameters for both
SVM and ME classifiers (e.g., the C in the SVM)
are all with the default values. In order to facilitate
the comparison with previously reported results, the
question classification performance is measured by
accuracy, i.e., the proportion of the correctly classi-
fied questions among all test questions.
4.1 Individual Feature Contribution
Table 1 shows the question classification accuracy
of SVM and ME using individual feature sets for
6 coarse and 50 fine classes. Among all feature
sets, wh-word + head word proves to be very infor-
mative for question classification. Our first Word-
Net semantic feature augment, the inclusion of di-
rect hypernym, can further boost the accuracy in the
fine classes for both SVM and ME, up to four per-

cent. This phenomena conforms to Krishnan et al
(2005) that WordNet hypernym benefits mainly on
the 50 fine classes classification. Li and Roth (2006)
made use of semantic features including named en-
tities, WordNet senses, class-specific related words,
and distributional similarity based categories. Their
system managed to improve around 4 percent with
the help of those semantic features. They reported
that WordNet didn?t contribute much to the system,
while our results show that the WordNet signifi-
cantly boosts the accuracy. The reason may be that
their system expanded the hypernyms for each word
in the question, while ours only expanded the head
word. In doing so, the augmentation does not intro-
duce much noisy information. Notice that the inclu-
sion of various depth of hypernyms results in differ-
ent accuracy. The depth of six brings the highest ac-
curacy of 85.4% and 85.6% for SVM and ME under
50 classes, which is very competitive to the previ-
ously reported best accuracy of 86.2% (Krishnan et
al., 2005).
Our second proposed WordNet semantic feature,
the indirect use of hypernym, does not perform as
good as the first approach; it only contributes the
accuracy gain of 1.8 and 1.6 in the fine classes for
SVM and ME respectively. The reason may be two
fold: 1) the description words (usually one to three
words) of question categories are not representative
enough, and 2) the indirect use of hypernyms via
the WordNet similarity package is not as efficient as
direct use of hypernyms.
Among the surface words features, unigram fea-
ture perform the best with accuracy of 80.4% for
SVM under 50 classes, and 88.0% for SVM under
6 classes. It is not surprising that the word shape
933
feature only achieves small gain in question classi-
fication, as the use of five shape type does not pro-
vide enough information for question classification.
However, this feature is treated as an auxiliary one to
boost a good classifier, as we will see in the second
experiment.
4.2 Incremental Feature Contribution
Based on the individual feature contribution, we
then trained the SVMs and MEs using wh-word,
head word, direct hypernyms (with depth 6) of head
word, unigram, and word shape incrementally. Table
2 shows the question classification accuracy (bro-
ken down by question types) of SVM and ME for 6
coarse and 50 fine classes. As can be seen, the main
difficulty for question classification lies in the what
type questions. SVM and ME perform roughly iden-
tical if they use the same features. For both SVM
and ME, the baseline using the wh-head word and
head word results in 81.4% and 82.0% respectively
for 50 fine class classification (92.0% and 92.2% for
6 coarse classes). The incremental use of hypernym
feature within 6 depths boost about four percent for
both SVM and ME under 50 classes, while slight
gain or slight loss for SVM and ME for 6 coarse
classes. The further use of unigram feature leads to
another three percent gain for both SVM and ME in
50 classes. Finally, the use of word shape leads to
another 0.6% accuracy increase for both SVM and
ME in 50 classes. The best accuracy achieved for
50 classes is 89.2% for SVM and 89.0% for ME.
For 6 coarse classes, SVM and ME achieve the best
accuracy of 93.4% and 93.6% respectively.
Our best result feature space only consists of
13?697 binary features and each question has 10 to
30 active features. Compared to the over feature size
of 200?000 in Li and Roth (2002), our feature space
is much more compact, yet turned out to be more
informative as suggested by the experiments.
Note that if we replace the bigram with unigram,
SVM and ME achieve the overall accuracy of 88.4%
and 88.0% respectively for 50 fine classes, and the
use of trigram leads SVM and ME to 86.6% and
86.8% respectively. The inclusion of unigram, bi-
gram and trigram together won?t boost the accu-
racy, which reflects the fact that the bigram and tri-
gram features cannot bring more information given
that unigram, wh-word and head word features are
present. This is because the useful information
which are supposed to be captured by bigram or tri-
gram are effectively captured by wh-word and head
word features. The unigram feature thus outper-
forms bigram and trigram due to the fact that it is
less sparse. In addition, if we replace the indirect
use of hypernym with the direct use of hypernym,
the overall accuracy is 84.6% and 84.8% for SVM
and ME respectively. All these experiments conform
to the individual features contributions as shown in
Table 1.
For a better understanding of the error distribu-
tion with respect to the 50 question categories, Ta-
ble 3 shows the precision and recall for each ques-
tion type in the best result (89.2%) using SVM.
It is not surprising that some of the categories are
more difficult to predict such as ENTY:other and
ENTY:product, while others are much easier such
as HUMAN:individual, since the former are more
semantically ambiguous than the latter.

lenge questions. For instance, the question What
is the proper name for a female walrus has been
correctly classified as ENTY:animal. However, it
still has nearly ten percent error rate for 50 fine
classes. The reason is three fold: 1) there are in-
herently ambiguity in classifying a question. For
instance, the question What is mad cow disease, it
could be either of type DESC:def or ENTY:dismed;
2) there are inconsistent labeling in the training data
and test data. For instance, What is the popula-
tion of Kansas is labeled with the type NUM:other
while What is the population of Arcadia , Florida
is labeled with type NUM:count. Another exam-
ple, What county is Chicago in is labeled with type
LOC:other while What county is Phoenix , AZ in is
labeled with type LOC:city; and 3) The parser can
produce incorrect parse tree which would result in
wrong head word extraction. For instance, the head
word extracted from What is the speed humming-
birds fly is hummingbirds (the correct one should be
speed), thus leading to the incorrect classification of
ENTY:animal (rather than the correct NUM:speed).
5 Conclusion
In contrast to Li and Roth (2006)?s approach which
makes use of very rich feature space, we proposed
a compact yet effective feature set. In particular,
we proposed head word feature and presented two

approaches to augment semantic features of such
head words using WordNet. In addition, Lesk?s
word sense disambiguation algorithm was adapted
and the depth of hypernym feature was optimized
through cross validation, which was to introduce
useful information while not bringing too much
noise. With further augment of wh-word, unigram
feature, and word shape feature, we can obtain ac-
curacy of 89.2% using linear SVMs, or 89.0% using
ME for 50 fine classes.
