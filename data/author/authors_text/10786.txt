Abstract 
In this paper, we propose a machine    
learning approach to rhetorical role       
identification from legal documents. In our 
approach, we annotate roles in sample 
documents with the help of legal experts 
and take them as training data.  Conditional 
random field model has been trained with 
the data to perform rhetorical role         
identification with reinforcement of rich 
feature sets. The understanding of structure 
of a legal document and the application of 
mathematical model can brings out an     
effective summary in the final stage. Other 
important new findings in this work         
include that the training of a model for one 
sub-domain can be extended to another 
sub-domains with very limited augmenta-
tion of feature sets. Moreover, we can     
significantly improve extraction-based 
summarization results by modifying the 
ranking of sentences with the importance 
of specific roles. 
1 Introduction 
With the availability of large number of colossal 
legal documents in electronic format, there is a 
rising need for effective information retrieval tools 
to assist in organizing, processing and retrieving 
this information and presenting them in a suitable 
user-friendly format. To that end, text summariza-
tion is an important step for many of these larger 
information management goals. In recent years, 
much attention has been focused on the problem of 
understanding the structure and textual units in 
legal judgments (Farzindar & Lapalme, 2004). In 
this case, performing automatic segmentation of a 
document to understand the rhetorical roles turns 
out to be an important research issue.  For instance, 
Farzindar (2004) proposed a text summarization 
method to manipulate factual and heuristic   
knowledge from legal documents. Hachey and 
Grover (2005) explored machine learning approach 
to rhetorical status classification by performing 
fact extraction and sentence extraction for        
automatic summarization of texts in the legal    
domain. They formalized the problem to extract 
most important units based on the identification of 
thematic structure of the document and determina-
tion of argumentative roles of the textual units in 
the judgment. They mainly used linguistic features 
to identify the thematic structures.   
   In this paper, we discuss methods for automatic 
identification of rhetorical roles in legal judgments 
based on rules and on machine learning techniques. 
Using manually annotated sample documents on 
three different legal sub-domains (rent control,   
income tax and sales tax), we train an undirected 
graphical model to segment the documents along 
different rhetorical structures. To represent the 
documents for this work, we mainly used features 
like cue words, state transition, named entity,    
position and other local and global features. The 
segmented texts with identified roles play a crucial 
part in re-ordering the ranking in the final          
extraction-based summary. The important         
sentences are extracted based on the term          
distribution model given in [Saravanan et al 
2006]. In   order to develop a generic approach to 
perform segmentation, we use a fixed set of seven 
rhetorical categories based on Bhatia?s (1993) 
genre analysis shown in Table 1.  
   Graphical Models are nowadays used in many 
text   processing  applications;   however  the  main

Rhetorical Roles Description 
 Identifying the case  (1) The sentences that are present in a judgment to identify the issues to be decided for a 
case. Courts call them as ?Framing the issues?. 
Establishing facts of the 
case  (2) 
The facts that are relevant to the present proceedings/litigations that stand proved, dis-
proved or unproved for proper applications of correct legal principle/law. 
Arguing the case   (3) Application of legal principle/law advocated by contending parties to a given set of 
proved facts. 
History of the case  (4) Chronology of events with factual details that led to the present case between parties 
named therein before the court on which the judgment is delivered. 
Arguments (Analysis ) (5) The court discussion on the law that is applicable to the set of proved facts by weighing 
the arguments of contending parties with reference to the statute and precedents that are 
available. 
Ratio decidendi    (6) 
(Ratio of the decision) 
Applying the correct law to a set of facts is the duty of any court. The reason given for 
application of any legal principle/law to decide a case is called Ratio decidendi in legal 
parlance. It can also be described as the central generic reference of text. 
Final decision  (7) 
(Disposal) 
It is an ultimate decision or conclusion of the court following as a natural or logical out-
come of ratio of the decision 
Table 1. The current working version of the rhetorical annotation scheme for legal judgments. 
 
focus has been performing Natural Language   
processing tasks on newspaper and research paper 
domains. As a novel approach, we have tried and 
implemented the CRF model for role identification 
in legal domain. In this regard, we have first      
implemented rule based approach and extend this 
method with additional features and a probabilistic 
model. In another study, CRF is used as a tool to 
model the sequence labeling problem for summari-
zation task (Shen at al., 2006). In our work, we are 
in the process of   developing a fully automatic 
summarization system for a legal domain on the 
basis of Lafferty?s (2001) segmentation task and 
Teufel & Moen?s (2004) gold standard approaches. 
Legal judgments are different in characteristics 
compared with articles reporting scientific research 
papers and other simple domains related to the 
identification of basic structures of a document. To 
perform a summarization methodology and find 
out important portions of a legal document is a 
complex problem (Moens, 2004). Even the skilled 
lawyers are facing difficulty in identifying the 
main       decision part of a law report. The genre 
structure identified for legal judgment in our work 
plays a crucial role in identifying the main decision 
part in the way of breaking the document in     
anaphoric chains. The sentence extraction task 
forms part of an automatic summarization system 
in the legal domain. The main focus of this paper is 
information extraction task based on the identified 
roles and methods of structuring summaries    
which  has considered  being a  hot  research  topic  
 
Most traditional rule learning algorithms are based 
on a divide-and-conquer strategy. SLIPPER 
[Cohen, 1999] is one of the standard rule learning 
algorithms used for information retrieval task. In 
SLIPPER, the ad hoc metrics used to guide the 
growing and pruning of rules are replaced with 
metrics based on the formal analysis of boosting 
algorithms. For each instance, we need to check 
each and every rule in the rule set for a given    
sentence. It takes more time for larger corpora 
 
 
(Yeh et al, 2005). Now we will discuss the       
importance of identifying rules in the data         
collection by various methods available for rule 
learning in the next section. 
2 Text Segmentation Algorithms 
We explain two approaches to text segmentation 
for identifying the rhetorical roles in legal       
judgments. The focus of the first approach is on a 
rule-based method with novel rule sets which we 
fine-tuned for legal domains. That is, we frame text 
segmentation as a rule learning problem. The    
proposed rule-based method can be enhanced with 
additional features and a probabilistic model. An 
undirected graphical model, Conditional Random 
Field (CRF) is used for this purpose. It shows   
significant improvement over the rule-based 
method. The explanation of these methods is given 
in the following sections. 
2.1 Rule-based learning algorithms 
482
compared to other rule learning algorithms even 
for  a  two-class  problem.  If  we  need to  consider  
more than two classes and to avoid overfitting of 
ensemble of rules, one has to think of grouping the 
rules in a rule set and some chaining mechanism 
has to be followed. Another rule learning algorithm 
RuleFit (Friedman & Popescu, 2005) generates a 
small comprehensible rule set which is used in   
ensemble learning with larger margin. In this case, 
overfitting may happen, if the rule set gets too 
large and thus some form of control has to be 
maintained. Our main idea is to find a preferably 
small set of rules with high predictive accuracy and 
with marginal execution time.   
   We propose an alternative rule learning strategy 
that concentrates on classification of rules and 
chaining relation in each rhetorical role (Table 1) 
based on the human annotation schemes. A chain 
relation is a technique used to identify co-     
occurrences of roles in legal judgments. In our   
approach, rules are conjunctions of primitive    
conditions. As used by the boosting algorithms, a 
rule set R can be any hypothesis that partitions the 
set of instance X into particular role categorization; 
the set of instances which satisfy any one of seven 
different set of categorized roles. We start by    
generating rules that describe the original features 
found in the training set. Each rule outputs 1 if its 
condition is met, 0 if it is not met.  Let us now   
define for a sample document X = (S1, S2,?.,Sm) 
of size m, we assume that the set of rules     
R = {r
             
    
The CRF model-based retrieval system designed in 
this paper will depict the way a human can summa-
rize a legal judgment by understanding the        
importance of roles and related contents.           
Conditional Random Fields is one of the recently 
emerging graphical models which have been used 
for text segmentation problems and proved to be 
one of the best available frame works compared to 
other existing models (Lafferty, 2001).  A      
judgment can be regarded as a sequence of        
sentences that can be segmented along the seven 
rhetorical roles where each segments is relatively 
coherent in content. We use CRF as a tool to 
model the text segmentation problem. CRFs are 
undirected graphical models used to specify the 
conditional probabilities of possible label          
sequences given an observation sequence. More-
over, the conditional probabilities of label         
sequences can depend on arbitrary, non independ-
ent features of the observation sequence, since we 
are not forming the model to consider the          
distribution of those dependencies. In a special 
case in which the output nodes of the graphical 
model are linked by edges in a linear chain, CRFs 
make a first-order Markov independence           
assumption with binary feature functions, and thus 
can be understood as conditionally-trained finite 
state   machines (FSMs) which are suitable for se-
quence labeling.            
    
                
 
   A linear chain CRF with parameters                   
C = {C1,r2,?} are applied to sample X, where each 
rule ri : X ? L  represents the mapping of     
sentences of X onto a rhetorical role and     
L = {L1,L2,?,L7}. Each Li represents a rhetorical 
role from the fixed set shown in Table 1. An     
outline of our method is given below.  
 
   Procedure Test (X) 
     {    Read test set 
           Read instances from sample X (instances  may  be 
            words,  N-grams or even full sentences) 
            Apply rules in R (with role categorization 
                       by maintaining chain relation) 
             For k = 1 to m sentences   
For i = 1, 2, ?. no. of instances in each sentence 
For j = 1 to 7      /* 7 identified roles */  
If there exist a rule which satisfies then  
       X(i,j)  gets a value  1    
Else 
   X(i,j) gets a value {1,0} based on chain relation 
 S(k) = L (argmax ?(X(i,j))) 
                                      j       i      
   } 
2.2 Conditional Random Fields and Features 
1,C2,?..} defines a  conditional probability 
for a label sequence l = l1,?..lw (e.g., Establishing 
facts of the case, Final decision, etc.) given an    
observed input sequence s = s1,?sW to be 
        1          w m 
    PC(l | s) = ---  exp[?? Ck fk (lt-1, lt. s, t)  ?.   (1) 
      Zs             t=1 k=1 
where Zs  is the normalization factor that makes the 
probability of all state sequences sum to one,             
fk (lt-1, lt, s, t) is one of  m feature functions which is 
generally binary valued and Ck is a learned weight 
associated with feature function. For example, a 
feature may have the value of 0 in most cases, but 
given the text ?points for consideration?, it has the 
value 1 along the transition where lt-1 corresponds 
to a state with the label identifying the case, lt   cor-
responds to a state  with the label  history of the 
case,  and  fk is  the feature  function  PHRASE=  
483
?points for consideration? belongs to s at position t 
in the sequence. Large positive values for Ck     
indicate a preference for such an event, while large 
negative values make the event unlikely and near 
zero for relatively uninformative features. These 
weights are set to maximize the conditional log 
likelihood of labeled sequence in a training set     
D = {( s
 
State Transition features - In CRFs, state        
transitions are also represented as features (Peng & 
McCullam, 2006). The feature function f
t, lt) : t = 1,2,?w), written as: 
 
         LC (D) =   ?log PC(li | si) 
                                           i 
                w m   
            =  ? (? ? Ck fk (lt-1, lt. s, t)  - log Zsi )...(2) 
                           i
       
t=1 k=1 
The training state sequences are fully labeled and 
definite, the objective function is convex, and thus 
the model is guaranteed to find the optimal weight 
settings in terms of LC (D). The probable labeling 
sequence for an input si can be efficiently     
calculated by dynamic programming using     
modified Viterbi algorithm. These implementa-
tions of CRFs are done using newly developed java 
classes which also use a quasi-Newton method 
called L-BFGS to find these feature weights     
efficiently. In addition to the following standard set 
of features, we also added other related features to 
reduce the complexity of legal domain. 
     
Legal vocabulary features - One of the simplest 
and most obvious set of features is decided using 
the basic vocabularies from a training data. The 
words that appear with capitalizations, affixes, and 
in abbreviated texts are considered as important 
features. Some of the phrases that include v. and 
act/section are the salient features for arguing the 
case and arguments categories. 
  
 
      
   
We have gathered a corpus of legal judgments up 
to the year 2006 which were downloaded from 
www.keralawyer.com specific to the sub-domains 
of rent control, income tax and sales tax. Using the 
manually annotated subset of the corpus (200 
judgments) we have performed a number of      
preliminary experiments to determine which 
method would be appropriate for role identifica-
tion. The annotated corpus is available from 
iil.cs.iitm.ernet.in/datasets. Even though, income 
tax and sales tax judgments are based on similar 
facts, the number of relevant legal sections /      
provisions are differ. The details and structure of 
judgments related to rent control domain are not 
the same compared to income tax and sales tax 
domains. Moreover, the roles like ratio decidendi 
and final decision occur many times spread over 
the full judgment in sales tax domain, which is 
comparatively different to other sub-domains.  We 
have implemented both the approaches on rent 
control domain successfully. We found that the 
other sub-domains need specific add-on features 
which improve the result by an additional 20%. 
Based on this, we have introduced additional     
features and new set of rules for the income tax 
and sales tax related judgments. The modified rule 
set and additional features are smaller in number, 
but  create  a  good impact  on the  rhetorical status  
Indicator/cue phrases ? The term ?cue phrase? 
indicates the key phrases frequently used which are 
the indicators of common rhetorical roles of the 
sentences (e.g. phrases such as ?We agree with 
court?, ?Question for consideration is?, etc.,). In 
this study, we encoded this information and     
generated automatically explicit linguistic features.    
Feature functions for the rules are set to 1 if they 
match words/phrases in the input sequence exactly.  
Named entity recognition - This type of     
recognition is not considered fully in summarizing     
scientific articles (Teufel & Moens, 2002).  But in 
our work, we included few named entities like   
Supreme Court, Lower court etc., and generate  
binary-valued entity type features which take the 
value 0 or 1 indicating the presence or absence of a 
particular entity type in the sentences. 
Local features and Layout features - One of the 
main advantages of CRFs is that they easily afford 
the use of arbitrary features of the input. One can 
encode abbreviated features; layout features such 
as position of paragraph beginning, as well as the 
sentences appearing with quotes, all in one     
framework.  
k (lt-1, lt. s, 
t) in Eq. (1) is a general function over states and 
observations. Different state transition features can 
be defined to form different Markov-order       
structures. We define state transition features    
corresponding to appearance of years attached with 
Section and Act nos. related to the labels arguing 
the case and arguments.

classification in   the  sales  tax   and  income   tax     
domains. It is common practice to consider human 
performances as an upper bound for most of the IR 
tasks, so in our evaluation, the performance of the 
system has been successfully tested by matching 
with human annotated documents. 
    Kappa (Siegal & Castellan, 1988) is an      
evaluation measure used in our work to compare 
the inter-agreement between sentences extracted 
by two human annotators for role identification in 
legal judgments. The value (K=0.803) shows the 
good reliability of human annotated corpus. The 
results given in Table 2 show that CRF-based and 
rule-based methods perform well for each role 
categories compared to SLIPPER method. CRF-
based method performs extremely well and paired 
t-test result indicates that it is significantly (p < 
.01) higher than the other two methods on     
rhetorical role identification for legal judgments 
belonging to  rent control, income tax and sales tax  
        Figure 1 shows that the distribution of the seven 
categories is very much skewed, with 60% of all 
sentences being classified as history of the case. 
Basically it includes the   remaining contents of the  
 Table 2. Precision, Recall and F-measure for seven rhetorical roles  
sub-domains. In this experiment, we also made an 
effort to understand the annotation of relevance of 
seven rhetorical categories.

document other than the six categories. In this 
case, we have calculated the distribution among 10  
judgments related to rent control documents.     
Figure 2 shows the rhetorical category distribution 
among the 10 different summaries from rent     
control domain. This shows that the resulting   
category distribution is far more evenly distributed 
than the one covering all sentences in Figure 1. 
Ratio of decidendi and final decision are the     
two most frequent categories in the sentences     
extracted from judgments. The label numbers men-
tioned in the Figures denote the rhetorical roles 
which as defined in Table 1. 
 
  
The automatic text summarization process starts 
with sending legal document to a preprocessing 
stage. In this preprocessing stage, the document is 
to be divided into segments, sentences and tokens. 
We have introduced some new feature identifica-
tion techniques to explore paragraph alignments. 
This process includes the understanding of        
abbreviated texts and section numbers and argu-
ments which are very specific to the structure of 
legal documents. The other useful statistical    
natural language processing tools, such as filtering 
out stop list words, stemming etc., are carried out 
in the preprocessing stage. The resulting            
intelligible words are useful in the normalization of 
terms in the term distribution model (Saravanan et 
al., 2006). During the final stage, we have altered 
the ranks or removed some of the sentences from 
the final summary based on the structure           
discovered using CRF. The summarization module 
architecture is shown in Figure 3.

    The application of term distribution model 
brings out a good extract of sentences present in a 
legal document to generate a summary. The      
sentences with labels identified during CRF      
implementation can be used with the term         
distribution model to give more significance to 
some of the sentences with specific roles.       
Moreover, the structure details available in this 
stage are useful in improving the coherency and 
readability among the sentences present in the 
summary.  
3 Legal Document Summarization 
Extraction of sentences in the generation of a 
summary at different percentage levels of text is 
one of the widely used methods in document   
summarization (Radev et al, 2002). For the legal 
domain, generating a summary from the original 
judgment is a complex problem. Our approach to 
produce the summary is extraction-based method 
which identifies important elements present in a 
legal judgment. The identification of the document 
structure using CRF-model categorizes the key 
ideas from the details of a legal judgment. The 
genre structure has been applied to final summary 
to improve the readability and coherence. In order 
to evaluate the effectiveness of our summarizer, we 
have applied four different measures to look for a 
match on the model summary generated by     
humans (head notes) from the text of the original 
judgments.  
  
Extrinsic and intrinsic are the two different   
evaluation strategies available for text summariza-
tion (Sparck Jones & Gablier, 1996). Intrinsic 
measure shows the presence of source contents in 
the summary. F-measure and MAP are two      
standard intrinsic measures used for the evaluation 
of our system-generated summary. We have also 
used ROUGE evaluation approach (Lin, 2004) 
which is based on n-gram co-occurrences between 
machine summaries and ideal human summaries.

3.2 Evaluation of  a summary 
486
In this paper, we have applied ROUGE-1 and 
ROUGE-2 which are simple n-gram measures. We  
compared our results with Microsoft, Mead    
Summarizer (Radev et al, 2003) and other two 
simple baselines: one which chooses 15% of 
words of the beginning of the judgment and      
second chooses last 10% of words of the judgment 
with human reference summaries. Both the     
baselines defined in this study are standard     
baselines for newspaper and research domains. 
The result shown in Table 3 highlights the better 
performances of our summarizer compared to 
other methods considered in this study.  We can 
see that the results of MEAD and WORD      
summaries are not at the expected level, while our 
summarizer is best in terms of all four evaluation 
measures. Results are clearly indicated that our 
system performs significantly better than the other 
systems for legal judgments. 
  
We would like to thank the legal fraternity for the 
assistance and guidance governs to us. Especially 
we express our sincere gratitude to the advocates 
Mr. S.B.C. Karunakaran and Mr. K.N. Somasunda-
ram for their domain advice and continuous     
guidance in understanding the structure of legal 
document and for hand annotated legal judgments.

4 Conclusion 
This paper describes a novel method for generating 
a summary for legal judgments with the help of 
undirected graphical models.  We observed that 
rhetorical role identification from legal documents 
is one of the primary tasks to understand the    
structure of the judgments. CRF model performs 
much better than rule based and other rule learning 
method in segmenting the text for legal domains. 
Our approach to summary extraction is based on 
the extended version of term weighting method. 
With the identified roles, the important sentences 
generated in the probabilistic model will be       
reordered or suppressed in the final summary. The 
evaluation results show that the summary     
generated by our summarizer is closer to the      
human generated head notes, compared to the other 
methods considered in this study. Hence the legal 
community will get a better insight without reading 
a full judgment. Moreover, our system-generated 
summary is more useful for lawyers to prepare the 
case history related to presently appearing cases.
