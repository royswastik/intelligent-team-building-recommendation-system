Since the Web by far represents the largest public repository of natural language texts, recent
experiments, methods, and tools in the area of corpus linguistics often use the Web as a corpus.
For applications where high accuracy is crucial, the problem has to be faced that a non-negligible
number of orthographic and grammatical errors occur in Web documents. In this article we in-
vestigate the distribution of orthographic errors of various types in Web pages. As a by-product,
methods are developed for efficiently detecting erroneous pages and for marking orthographic
errors in acceptable Web documents, reducing thus the number of errors in corpora and linguistic
knowledge bases automatically retrieved from the Web.
1. Introduction
The automated analysis of large corpora has many useful applications (Church and
Mercer 1993). Suitable language repositories can be used for deriving models of a
given natural language, as needed for speech recognition (Ostendorf, Digalakis,
and Kimball 1996; Jelinek 1997; Chelba and Jelinek 2002), language generation (Oh
and Rudickny 2000), and text correction (Kukich 1992; Amengual and Vidal 1998;
Strohmaier et al 2003b). Other corpus-based methods determine associations between
words (Grefenstette 1992; Dunning 1993; Lin et al 1998), which yields a basis for com-
puting thesauri, or dictionaries of terminological expressions and multiword lexemes
(Gaizauskas, Demetriou, and Humphreys 2000; Grefenstette 2001).
From multilingual texts, translation lexica can be generated (Gale and Church
1991; Kupiec 1993; Kumano and Hirakawa 1994; Boutsis, Piperidis, and Demiros 1999;
Grefenstette 1999). The analysis of technical texts is used to automatically build dictio-
naries of acronyms for a given field (Taghva and Gilbreth 1999; Yeates, Bainbridge, and
Witten 2000), and related methods help to compute dictionaries that cover the special
vocabulary of a given thematic area (Strohmaier et al 2003a). In computer-assisted lan-
guage learning (CALL), mining techniques for corpora are used to create individualized
and user-centric exercises for grammar and text understanding (Schwartz, Aikawa, and
Pahud 2004; Brown and Eskenazi 2004; Fletcher 2004a).
By Zipf?s law, most words, phrases, and specific grammatical constructions have
a very low frequency. Furthermore, the number of text genres and special thematic

areas that come with their own picture of language is large. This explains that most
of the aforementioned applications can only work when built on top of huge heteroge-
neous corpora. Since the Web represents by far the largest public repository for natural
language texts, and since Web search engines such as Google offer simple access to
pages where language material of a given orthographic, grammatical, or thematic kind
is found, many recent experiments and technologies use the Web as a corpus (Kehoe and
Renouf 2002; Morley, Renouf, and Kehoe 2003; Kilgarriff and Grefenstette 2003; Resnik
and Smith 2003; Way and Gough 2003; Fletcher 2004b).
One potential problem for Web-based corpus linguistics is caused by the fact that
words and phrases occurring in Web pages are sometimes erroneous. Typing errors
represent one widespread phenomenon. Many Web pages, say, in English, are written
by non-native speakers, or by persons with very modest language competence. As a
consequence, spelling errors and grammatical bugs result. The character sets that are
used for writing Web pages are often not fully adequate for the alphabet of a given
language, which represents another systematic source for inaccuracies. Furthermore, a
small number of texts found in the Web is obtained via optical character recognition
(OCR), which may again lead to garbled words. As a consequence of these and other
error sources, the Web contains a considerable number of ?bad? pages with language
material that is inappropriate for corpus construction.
In one way or the other, all the aforementioned applications are affected by these
inadequacies. While the problem is probably not too serious for approaches that merely
collect statistical information about given language items, the construction of dictio-
naries and related linguistic knowledge bases?which are, after all, meant to be used
in different scenarios of automated language processing?becomes problematic if too
many erroneous entries are retrieved from Web pages. Obviously, in computer-assisted
language learning it is a principal concern that words and phrases from the Web that
are presented to the user are error free.
In discussions we found that problems resulting from erroneous language material
in Web pages for distinct applications are broadly acknowledged (see also Section 4.4 of
Kilgarriff and Grefenstette [2003]). Still, to the best of our knowledge, a serious analysis
of the frequency and distribution of orthographic errors in the Web is missing, and no
general methods have been developed that help to detect and exclude pages with too
many erroneous words. In this article we first report on a series of experiments that try
to answer the following questions:
1. What are important types of orthographic errors found in Web pages?
2. How frequent are errors of a given kind? For a given error level
(percentage of erroneous tokens) ?, which percentage of Web pages
exceeds error level ??
3. How do these figures depend on the language, on the thematic area,
and on the genre of the Web pages that are considered? How do
these figures depend on the document format of the Web pages that
are considered?
We then look at the problem indicated above.
4. Which methods help to automatically detect Web pages with many
orthographic errors?
Which methods help to mark orthographic errors found in Web pages?
296
Ringlstetter, Schulz, and Mihov Orthographic Errors in Web Pages
To answer questions 1?3, we retrieved and analyzed a collection of large English
and German corpora from the Web, using suitable queries to Web search engines. In our
error statistics we wanted to distinguish between (1) ?general? Web pages collected
without any specific thematic focus on the one hand and Web pages from specific
thematic areas on the other hand, and (2) between Web pages written in HTML and
Web documents written in PDF. To cover the first difference, for both languages we
retrieved two general corpora as well as a number of corpora for specific thematic
areas. All these corpora only contain HTML pages. A parallel series of general cor-
pora was collected that are composed of PDF documents. Details are provided in
Section 2.
Special Vocabulary. Web pages often contain tokens that do not belong to the standard
vocabulary of the respective language. Typical categories are, for example, special
names, slang, archaic language, expressions from foreign languages, and special ex-
pressions from computer science/programming. Classification and detection of special
vocabulary is outside the scope of the present article. Since sometimes a clear separation
between special vocabulary and errors is difficult, we briefly come back to this problem
in Section 5.4.
Proper Errors. Focusing on garbled standard vocabulary, tokens may be seriously dam-
aged in an ?unexplainable? way. Most of the remaining errors can be assigned to one of
the four classes mentioned above:
 typing errors (i.e., errors caused by a confusion of keys when typing a
document),
 spelling errors (?cognitive? errors resulting from insufficient language
competence),
 errors resulting from inadequate character encoding, and
 OCR errors.
In order to estimate the number of errors of a given kind in the corpora, special
error dictionaries were built. These dictionaries, which only list garbled words of
a given language that do not accidentally represent correct words, try to cover a
high number of the conventional errors of each type that are typically found in Web
pages and other documents. Section 3 motivates the use of error dictionaries for er-
ror detection. Details of the construction of the error dictionaries are discussed in
Section 4.
In Section 5, we estimate the number of orthographic errors in the corpora that
remain undetected because they do not occur in the error dictionaries. We also estimate
the percentage of correct tokens of the corpora that are erroneously treated as errors
since they appear in the error dictionaries. Our results show that the number of tokens
of a text that appear in the error dictionaries can be considered as a lower approximation
of the number of real orthographic errors.
In Section 6, we describe the distribution of orthographic errors of the types dis-
tinguished above in the general test corpora, counting occurrences of entries of the
error dictionaries. Section 7 summarizes the most important differences that arise when
using PDF corpora, or corpora for special thematic areas. Section 8 presents various
297
Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 3
results that illuminate the relationship between the error rate of a document and
its genre.
In our experiments we observed in all corpora a rich spectrum of error rates, ranging
from perfect documents to a small number of clearly unacceptable pages. This moti-
vates the design of filters that efficiently recognize and reject pages with an error rate
beyond a user-specified threshold. The construction of appropriate filters is described
in Section 9, where we also demonstrate the effect of using these filters, comparing
the figures obtained in Section 6 with the corresponding figures for filtered corpora.
Filters work surprisingly well due to a Zipf-like distribution of error frequencies in
Web pages.
In Section 10, we present two experiments that exemplify how the methods de-
veloped in the article may in fact help to improve corpus-based methods. The general
question of how deeply distinct methods from computational linguistics based on Web
corpora are affected by orthographic errors in Web pages and to what extent the meth-
ods developed in the article help to remedy these deficiencies are too complex to be
discussed here.
The main insights and contributions are summarized in the Conclusion (Section 11)
where we also comment on future work and on some practical difficulties one has to
face when collecting and analyzing large corpora from the Web.
2. Corpora
The basis for the evaluations described below is a collection of corpora, each composed
of Web pages retrieved with Web search engines (Google/AllTheWeb). In order to
study how specific features of a language might influence the distribution of ortho-
graphic errors, all corpora were built up in two variants. The English and German
variant, respectively, contain Web pages that were classified as English and German Web
pages by the search engine. As described above, for both languages we collected general
corpora with Web pages without any thematic focus and, in addition, corpora that cover
five specific thematic areas to be described below. Statements on the ?representative-
ness? of corpora derived from the Web are notoriously difficult. The composition of
corpora retrieved with Web search engines depends on the kind of queries that are used,
on the ranking mechanisms of the engine, and on the details of the collection strategy.
We mainly concentrated on simple queries and straightforward collection strategies.
Still, the large number of subcorpora and pages that were evaluated should guarantee
that accidental results are avoided.
2.1 General Web Corpora
In a first attempt, we tried to obtain a general German HTML corpus using the mean-
ingless query der die das, i.e., the three German definite articles. However, queries
of this and a similar form did not lead to satisfactory results: As a consequence of
Google?s ranking mechanism, which prefers ?authorities? (Brin and Page 1998), mainly
portals of big organizations, companies, and others were retrieved. These pages are
often dominated by graphical elements. Portions of text are usually small and carefully
edited, which means that orthographic errors are less frequent than in other ?less
official? pages.
To achieve a more realistic scenario we randomly generated quintuples, each col-
lecting five terms of the 10,000 top frequent German words. We used Google to retrieve
298
Ringlstetter, Schulz, and Mihov Orthographic Errors in Web Pages
10 pages per query (quintuple) until we obtained 1,000 pages. A considerable number
of the URLs were found to be inactive. After conversion to ASCII and a preliminary
analysis of error rates with methods described below, some of the remaining pages were
found to contain very large lists of general keywords, including many orthographic
errors. Apparently these lists and errors were only added to improve the ranking of
the page in search engines, even for ill-formed queries. We excluded these pages. The
remaining documents represent the ?primary? general German HTML corpus. Since we
wanted to know how results depend on the peculiarities of the selected set of pages, a
second series of queries of the same type was sent to Google to retrieve a ?secondary?
general German HTML corpus with a completely disjoint set of pages.
Similar procedures were used to obtain a primary and a secondary general English
HTML corpus, a general German PDF corpus, and a general English PDF corpus. The
translation from PDF to ASCII was found to be error prone, in particular for German
documents (cf. Gartner 2003). Due to this process, some converted PDF documents
were seriously damaged. Since we focus on errors in original Web pages (as opposed
to converted versions of such pages), these files were excluded as well. We found
these pages when computing error rates based on error dictionaries as described in
Sections 6 and 7.
The number of Web pages and the number of normal tokens (i.e., tokens composed
of standard letters only) in the resulting six corpora are shown in Table 1. Numbers (1)
and (2) stand for the primary and secondary corpora, respectively.
2.2 Web Corpora for Specific Thematic Areas
We looked at the thematic areas ?Middle Ages,? ?Holocaust,? ?Fish,? ?Mushrooms,?
and ?Neurology.? The given selection of topics tries to cover scientific areas as well as
history and hobbies.
Simple Crawl. A first series of corpora was collected by sending a query with 25
?terminological? keywords mechanically found in a small corpus of the given area to
the AllTheWeb search engine and collecting the answer set. For example, the queries
mushrooms mushroom pine edible harvesting morels harvested harvesters dried
chanterelle matsutake poisonous flavor chanterelles caps fungi drying stuffing
humidity varieties boletes recipes spores conifers pickers

were respectively used for collecting the corpora Mushrooms E and Neurology E. The
ranking mechanism of AllTheWeb prefers pages containing hits for several keywords
of a disjunctive query. Since this form of corpus construction is straightforward, not all
pages in the resulting corpora belong to the given thematic area.
Refined Crawl. We wanted to see how results are affected when using less naive crawl-
ing methods. For the three areas ?Fish,? ?Mushrooms,? and ?Neurology,? the sec-
ondary corpora were retrieved using the following refined procedure: Starting from
a small tagged seed corpus for the given domain, we mechanically extracted termino-
logical open compounds for English (Sornlertlamvanich and Tanaka 1996; Smadja and
McKeown 1990) and compound nouns for German. Examples are amino group, action
potential, defense mechanism (English, neurology), truffle species, morel areas, harvesting tips
(English, mushrooms), Koffeinstoffwechsel, and Eisenkonzentration (German, neurology).
Each of these expressions was sent as a query to Google. From each answer set we
collected a maximum of 30 top-ranked hits (many answer sets were smaller). For each
document in the resulting corpus, the similarity with the seed corpus was controlled,
using a cosine measure (in practice, almost all documents passed the similarity filter).
Our method can be considered as a variant of Baroni and Bernardini?s (2004) and leads
to corpora with a strong thematic focus.
The statistics for all thematic corpora are summarized in Table 2. Numbers (1) and
(2) stand for corpora crawled with the simple and the refined crawling strategy, respec-
tively. The numbers indicate one interesting effect: Documents in the thematic corpora
obtained with the refined crawling strategy turned out to be typically rather short. Since
we only used the 30 top-ranked documents for each single query, this probably points
to a special feature of Google?s ranking mechanism. A manual inspection of hundreds
of documents for both the simple and the refined crawl did not lead to additional
insights.
3. Error Detection
For detecting orthographic errors of a particular type in texts, two naive base methods
may be distinguished.
1. A representative list of errors of the respective type is created and
manually checked. Each token of the text appearing in the list represents
an error (lower approximation).
2. A spell checker or a large-scale dictionary is used to detect ?suspicious?
words (error candidates). For each such token W we manually check
if W really represents an error and we determine its type (upper
approximation).
For large corpora, both methods have serious deficiencies. With Method 1, only a small
percentage of all errors is detected. On this basis, it is difficult to estimate the real
number of errors. When using Method 2, the number of tokens that have to be manually

checked becomes too large. In practice, a large number of error candidates represent
correct tokens. This is mainly due to special names and other types of nonstandard
vocabulary found in Web pages, as mentioned in the introduction.
We decided to use a third strategy, which can be considered as a synthesis and
compromise between the above two approaches. As a starting point, we took stan-
dard dictionaries of English, D(English); German, D(German); French, D(French);
and Spanish, D(Spanish); and a dictionary of geographic entities, D(Geos); a dictio-
nary of proper names, D(Names); and a dictionary of abbreviations and acronyms,
D(Abbreviations).1 The number of entries in the dictionaries is described in Table 3.
The German dictionary contains compound nouns, which explains the large number
of entries.
From these standard dictionaries, we derived special error dictionaries that were
used in the experiments described later. First, for each of the four error types mentioned
above we manually collected a number of general patterns that ?explain? possible
mutations from correct words to erroneous entries. In a second step, these patterns were
used to garble the words of the given background dictionaries. Third, garbled words
that were found to correspond to correct words (entries of the above dictionaries) were
excluded (filtering step). Collecting the remaining erroneous strings, we obtained large
error dictionaries for each type of orthographic error.
Experiments described in Section 5 show that our error dictionaries cover the major
part of all orthographic errors occurring in the English and German Web pages. At
1 These dictionaries are nonpublic. They have been built up at the Centre for Information and Language
Processing (CIS) during the last two decades (Maier-Meyer 1995; Guenthner 1996). Each entry comes
with a frequency value that describes the number of occurrences in a 1.5-terabyte subcorpus of the Web
from 1999. Dictionaries for French and Spanish were included to improve the filtering step. Suitable
dictionaries for other languages were not available.
301

the same time, the number of tokens that are erroneously treated as errors due to the
unavoidable incompleteness of the filtering step remains acceptable. On this basis, an
estimate of the number of conventional orthographic errors occurring in Web pages is
possible, counting the number of occurrences of entries of the error dictionaries.2 Before
we comment on these points, we describe the construction of the error dictionaries in
more detail. In the remainder of the article, by Dconv we denote the union of all the
conventional dictionaries listed above.
4. Construction of Error Dictionaries
For the construction of error dictionaries, the most important error patterns for each
type of error were determined. For typing errors and errors caused by character en-
coding problems, error patterns were obtained analytically. For spelling errors and
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) errors, important mutation patterns were col-
lected empirically. As a general rule, all error dictionaries were restricted to entries of
length >4. Many tokens of length ?4 occurring in texts represent acronyms, special
names, and abbreviations, and it is difficult to mechanically distinguish between this
special kind of vocabulary and errors.
4.1 Error Dictionaries for Typing Errors
Typing errors can be partitioned into transpositions, deletions, substitutions, and inser-
tions. Transpositions of two letters occur if two keys are hit in the wrong order. Deletions
result if a key is not properly pushed down. Substitutions occur if a neighbor key is
pressed down instead of the intended one. Horizontal and vertical shifts of fingers may
be distinguished. If a finger hits the middle between two keys, a neighbor key may be
pressed in addition to the intended one. The wrong letter may occur before or after the
correct letter.
Transpositions, deletions, substitutions, and insertions cover most of the typing
errors discussed in the literature (Kukich 1992). We ignored homologous errors, that
is, substitutions that are traced back to a confusion of the left and right hand. Since
2 Note that we do not capture false friends, that is, garbled strings that accidentally represent correct
words of the dictionary. Detection of false friends is known to be notoriously difficult and outside the
scope of this article.
302
Ringlstetter, Schulz, and Mihov Orthographic Errors in Web Pages
there are many possible positions for both hands, this kind of error leads to large
confusion sets.
Since we did not find other patterns in the texts, only mutation variants that are
exclusively composed of standard letters (as opposed to digits and other special sym-
bols) were taken into account. Furthermore, since typing errors in general do not affect
the first letter of a word,3 we left this letter unmodified. We analyzed the number of
mutated variants of a given word. Both for the American and for the German keyboard
we have approximately 16l variants for a word of length l. This shows that the above
patterns for typing errors are very productive. It is not possible to garble all the words
of our background dictionary for constructing the error dictionaries. For the generation
of the dictionary of English typing errors, Derr(English,typing), we took the 100,000
entries of the English background dictionary with the highest frequency. Applying the
above mutation patterns we generated 10,785,675 strings. After removal of duplicates
and deletion of words in Dconv (filtering step), we obtained 9, 427, 051 entries for the
dictionary Derr(English,typing).
The same procedure was used for creating the dictionary of German typing errors,
Derr(German,typing). Since the average length of German words is large, we obtained
13, 656, 866 entries.
4.2 Error Dictionaries for Spelling Errors
English. In order to find the most characteristic patterns for English spelling errors, a
bootstrapping procedure was used to compute an initial list of errors. We started with
the misspelled English words verry, noticable, arguement, and inteligence. For each term
we retrieved 20 Web documents. After conversion to ASCII we computed the list of all
normal tokens occurring in these documents. The resulting list was sorted by frequency,
and words in Dconv were filtered out. After a manual selection of new errors with high
Google counts, the procedure was iterated until we did not find new erroneous words
with high frequency. During the bootstrapping procedure, we also found Web pages
that listed some ?common misspelled words? of English. The most frequent errors
mentioned in these lists were also added. Table 4 presents some strings that were found
with a large number of Google hits.4
Most of the errors that we found can be traced back to a rule set partially described
in Table 5. The full rule set contains 95 rules. We applied each rule to D(English),
introducing one error at the first possible position, for each entry of the appropriate
form. As a result we obtained a list with 1,223,128 garbled strings. After applying the
standard filtering procedure, we obtained the dictionary Derr(English,spell) of English
spelling errors with 1,202,997 entries.
German. Similarly as for English, we built an initial error list. Bootstrapping was started
with the misspelled German terms na?hmlich, addresse, resourcen, and vorraus. Table 6
shows some of the resulting German words, the misspelled variant, and the number
of Google hits of the garbled version. From the initial error list, we obtained a set of 65
rules partially described in Table 7. We applied these rules to D(German), introducing
one error for each entry of the appropriate form. Each rule was applied to each entry
using the first possible position for mutation. For example, for the lexical entry Adresse of

the German standard dictionary we obtained the following error terms: adrese, ahdresse,

large size is mainly caused by the rules for reduplication of consonants, which are
not restricted by word context. The filtering procedure led to an error dictionary with
18, 970, 716 entries.

4.3 Error Dictionaries for OCR Errors
As a starting point we used a list of typical OCR errors that we found in a corpus with
200 pages of OCR output (Ringlstetter 2003). Error types are shown in Table 8.

English. The error dictionary Derr(English,ocr) was generated by applying to the en-
tries of D(English) the transformation rules listed in Table 8. The transformation of
D(English) with its 315, 300 entries led to a list of 1,697,189 entries. The filtering pro-
cedure where we erase words from Dconv led to the error dictionary Derr(English, ocr)
with 1, 532, 741 entries. Table 9 shows some of the most frequent English words, the
transformation result, and the number of Google hits of the garbled variant.
German. When scanning German texts, vowels a?, o?, and u? are often replaced by
their counterparts a, o, u. However, even more frequently, this kind of replacement
occurs as the result of a character encoding problem (see below). Since we wanted
to avoid having our statistics for OCR errors being heavily overloaded with errors
caused by character encoding problems, we did not add these patterns to the list of
typical OCR errors for German texts. This means that we applied to D(German) the
transformation rules mentioned in Table 8. The transformation of D(German) with its
2, 235, 136 entries led to a list of 11, 623, 989 strings. After filtering, we obtained the error
dictionary Derr(German,ocr) with 10, 608, 635 entries. Table 10 shows some frequent
German words, the transformation result, and the number of Google hits of the garbled
variant.

4.4 Error Dictionaries with Erroneous Character Encoding of German Words
In character sets used for the encoding of Web pages, often the German letters A?, O?, U?,
a?, o?, u?, and ? (?sharp s?) are not available. In many of these cases, vocals are replaced,
following the substitution scheme (e-transformation):
A? ? Ae, O? ? Oe, U? ? Ue, a? ? ae, o? ? oe, u? ? ue.
In other Web pages, the aforementioned vocals are replaced using the following scheme:
A? ? A, O? ? O, U? ? U, a? ? a, o? ? o, u? ? u.
This transformation, which is typically found in Web pages written by non-native
speakers of German, will be called -transformation.
Table 11 shows some transformed terms of the top 1,000 German words and gives
the number of Google hits for correct and incorrect spellings. The right-hand side of
the table gives the corresponding numbers for PDF documents. The numbers show that
misspellings caused by e-transformation are a widespread phenomenon. Note that the
quality of PDF corpora is much better in this respect.
When applying the e- or -transformation, letter ? is typically replaced by ss
(s-transformation). For two reasons, the distinction between ? and ss is a delicate matter.
Since the Swiss spelling is ss, a string representing an erroneous German word may be a
correct Swiss word. To make things even more complicated, the correct spelling of many
German words has been changed during the so-called ?Rechtschreibereform? some
years ago, which affected the selection between ? and ss (e.g., Mi?versta?ndnis became
Missversta?ndnis). Still (and unofficially), the old spelling variant is broadly used. In what
follows, a token written with ss that is officially written with ? is treated as an error.
We built two error dictionaries respectively representing errors introduced via
e-transformation and -transformation. All vowels of the form a?, o?, u? (or upper-case
variants) in the German dictionary were replaced by their images under the respective
transformation. Letter ? occurring in the entries was categorically replaced by ss. For
the e-transformation we obtained a list of 436, 198 strings. The filtering procedure led to
an error dictionary Derr(German, enc-e) with 432, 987 entries.
Applying the -transformation and the usual filtering step, we generated the error
dictionary Derr(German,enc-) with 407, 013 entries. A considerable number of well-
formed words was generated and filtered out. The rules of German morphology yield a
307
Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 3
partial explanation: For so-called strong verbs some paradigmatic forms only differ by
a mutation of vowels (mo?chte-mochte).
An extra error dictionary Derr(German,enc-s) was built by replacing ? by ss in
German dictionary entries without occurrences of vocals A?, O?, U?, a?, o?, u?. The dictionary
has 42, 340 entries.
4.5 Summary and Maximal Error Dictionaries
Using the union of all error dictionaries for both languages, we constructed the maximal
error dictionaries Derr(English,all) and Derr(German,all). Table 12 summarizes the sizes
of all error dictionaries.
5. Error Overproduction and Underproduction
Before we analyze the number of tokens in the corpora that represent entries of the
error dictionaries, we comment on the limitations of this kind of analysis. Obviously,
not all orthographic errors of a given type occur in the respective error dictionary
(underproduction). On the other hand, some tokens classified as errors by the error
dictionary might in fact be correct words (overproduction) due to the incompleteness of

Ringlstetter, Schulz, and Mihov Orthographic Errors in Web Pages
the final filtering step in the construction of the error dictionaries. From the construction
of the error dictionaries we may expect that incompleteness/underproduction is mainly
caused by
 missing patterns for spelling errors and OCR errors, and
 the fact that we do not seriously damage words when constructing the
error dictionaries.
For both English and German, to estimate under/overproduction of the error dictio-
naries, the primary general HTML corpus was split into four subclasses. The class
Best contains all documents where the number of hits (tokens representing entries
of the maximal error dictionary) per 1,000 tokens is ?1. For class Good (Bad, Worst,
respectively), the number of hits per 1,000 tokens is 1?5 (5?10, >10, respectively). The
number of documents in each class is found in Tables 13 and 14.
5.1 Estimating Underproduction
To estimate underproduction of the English error dictionaries, the English general
HTML corpus was split into subfiles, each containing 300 tokens. We then randomly
selected such subfiles and analyzed the proper errors found in these portions. Since
we wanted to avoid an unbalanced selection where most errors are from the doc-
ument class Worst, a maximum of three errors from each subfile was used for the
analysis. Error candidates were found with the help of a spell checker and using
our standard dictionaries as a second control. Slang and special vocabulary were
not used for the statistics. We also excluded errors where two words were merged.
We found that most of the latter errors were caused by the conversion process from
HTML to ASCII. Each candidate was manually controlled; in difficult cases we con-
sulted Merriam-Webster Online. We continued the search until 1,000 proper errors were
isolated. From these, 624 (62.4%) turned out to be entries of the maximal English error
dictionary.
Table 13 refines these statistics and shows the number of errors and the percentage
of errors found in the error dictionary for the four quality classes of documents. As a
tendency, recall of the error dictionary is better in ?bad? documents.
The same procedure was used for German and confirmed this tendency. From 1,000
errors in the German general HTML corpus, 638 (63.80%) were found in the maximal
German error dictionary. The statistics for the four quality classes of documents is
presented in Table 14.
5.2 Estimating Overproduction
In our first experiment with English texts we found that a considerable number of hits
corresponded to special names introduced in the documents. Many of these names are
artificial (e.g., Hitty). In order to avoid all difficulties with special names we decided
to restrict the error analysis in English texts to words starting with a lowercase letter.
In each of the four classes, 1,000 hits of this form were randomly selected. We then
manually checked which of these tokens represent correct words, reading contexts and
consulting Merriam-Webster Online in difficult cases.
The results are presented in Table 15 and show a clear tendency. The percentage of
proper errors is larger in documents with a large number of hits. In the class Worst, 95%

Best 229 60 29 48.33
of all hits are proper errors; in the class Best, only 60% of the hits represent orthographic
errors. Most of the remaining hits could be assigned to one of the following categories:
correct standard expressions (missing entries of the standard dictionaries), names and
geographic expressions, foreign language expressions, archaic and literary word forms,
and abbreviations. The number of hits in each category is found in Table 15. The large
number of standard words among the hits in the class Best is caused by an incomplete-
ness of our English dictionary, which does not always contain both the British and the
American spelling variants.
In the German general HTML corpus, where we could not restrict the experiment
to tokens starting with a lowercase letter, a more shallow picture is obtained (Table 16).
For the classes Best (61% proper errors), Good (62% proper errors), and Worst (88%
proper errors), results are similar to the English case and confirm the above-mentioned
general tendency. Due to the large number of names, foreign language expressions, and
archaic/literary word forms that are found in class Bad, we here have only 56% proper
errors. The results show that overproduction could be considerably reduced when filter-
ing error dictionaries with better standard dictionaries for geographic entities, personal
names, foreign language expressions, and archaic and literary word forms.

5.3 Summary So Far
From the above percentages we obtain a naive estimate for the ratio between the real
number of errors and the number of hits of the error dictionaries, which is presented in
Table 17. The results show that the number of hits can be seen as a lower approximation
of the real number of errors. The ratio between both numbers is larger for English. It
does not differ dramatically between the distinct quality classes. However, since both
over- and underproduction are larger for ?good? documents, error estimates for these
classes come with a larger degree of uncertainty.
5.4 Difficulties
The above analysis turned out to be much more time-consuming and difficult than
it might appear. One problem is caused by the fact that nonstandard vocabulary and
errors do not represent disjoint categories. Orthographic errors are sometimes ?abused?
as slang expressions. A separation between archaic/foreign language expressions and
orthographic errors is often only possible when taking the sentence context into
account. These and other examples explain that demarcation issues are sometimes
difficult to solve. The construction of special dictionaries for slang, foreign language
expressions, special names, and archaic word forms represents an important step
for future work. Using these dictionaries in the filtering step of the construction of
the error dictionaries, overproduction may probably be reduced in a significant way.
Furthermore, these dictionaries should help to detect Web pages with nonstandard
vocabulary of a particular type.

6. Distribution of Orthographic Errors in the General HTML Corpora
We define the error rate of a text with respect to an error dictionary Derr as the average
number of entries of Derr that are found among 1,000 tokens of the text. In this section
we describe the distribution of error rates for all types of errors in the general HTML
corpora. Experiments for other corpora are summarized in the following section. The
results of the previous section indicate that the error rate represents a reasonable lower
approximation for the real number of errors per 1,000 tokens in the document. Incom-
pleteness of the rule sets for generating spelling errors and OCR errors should be kept
in mind. Recall that in English documents, only words starting with a lowercase letter
are taken into account.
6.1 Distribution of Error Rates for Orthographic Errors
In the first test, we consider orthographic errors, that is, errors of arbitrary type. Ac-
cordingly, error rates for documents are computed with respect to the maximal error
dictionaries. For a coarse survey, as in the previous section, we distinguish four quality
classes Best, Good, Bad, Worst, respectively, covering pages with error rates in the
intervals [0, 1), [1, 5), [5, 10), and [10,?).
English. The histograms in Figure 1 show the percentage of documents in each class in
the primary (left-hand side) and secondary (right-hand side) English corpora. Remark-
ably, the differences between the two corpora are almost negligible. In both cases, most
documents belong to class Best; only a small percentage of documents belongs to classes
Bad and Worst.
Table 18 presents the average error rate for various document classes. As to the
length of documents in the corpora, drastic differences exist. We did not find a cor-
relation between document length and error rates, with the following eye-catching
exception: small (larger) documents of an excellent quality tend to have an error rate
0 (close to 0, but >0).5 In order to avoid a dominating influence of long documents,
we simply computed the arithmetic mean of all error rates obtained for the single
documents. The class Best 80% collects 80% of all documents with lowest error rate,
and similarly for the class Best 90%.
Note that a significant difference exists between the average rate for all documents
(2.47, 2.24, respectively) and the means for the Best 80% classes (0.67, 0.68, respectively).
These numbers point to an effect that will be found again in other figures and exper-
iments: The large majority of all documents in the corpora have a very good quality.
Yet, at the ?bad end? of the spectrum we find a considerable number of unacceptable
documents with a very large number of errors. The phenomenon becomes even more
apparent in Figure 2 (left diagram) where we depict the error rates of all documents.
In what follows we often describe mean error rates for all documents and for the class
Best 80%. When comparing distinct corpora, the two values help to see if deviations
concern the class of all documents or if they are rather caused by a small number of
?bad? documents.
Note also that all corresponding average error rates obtained for the primary and
secondary corpora are almost identical. This gives at least some evidence to the conjec-
5 This explains the special effect seen in Figures 14 and 15 where the refined crawl produces many short
documents.

rates for orthographic errors.
ture that for corpora crawled with similar queries and collection strategies, error rates
will not differ too much. As we see next, the situation for the German corpora is more
complex.
German. The histogram in Figure 3 shows the percentage of documents in each class
of the primary (left-hand side) and secondary (right-hand side) German corpora. A
large number of documents belongs to class Good. We now find a larger difference
between the primary and secondary corpora. Several phenomena might be responsible.
As mentioned above, for the German corpora we did not restrict the analysis to tokens
starting with a lowercase letter. Hence, documents with many names can cause special
effects and lead to differences between corpora. Second, errors caused by encoding
of special characters represent an important extra source for errors in German docu-
ments where numbers may vary from one corpus to another. This is seen in Table 20
where we analyze all error types occurring in the primary and secondary German
corpus. The means for e-transformation are 0.62 for the primary corpus and 1.40 for the
secondary corpus.
The average error rates obtained for distinct documents classes of the German
corpus, which are presented in Table 19, show that
 for all classes we have more errors than in the English documents, and
 for different corpora, sometimes nontrivial deviations must be expected.

829 documents, mean error rate 2.47) and the German (right diagram, 618 documents, mean
error rate 3.86) general HTML corpora. On the x-axis, documents are ordered by error rates;
documents with high rates are found on the right-hand side. In the left diagram, 7 documents
with error rates ranging from 42.99 to 64.22 have been omitted to simplify scaling. In the right
diagram, one document with error rate 40.07 is omitted.
A more detailed picture of the error rates in the primary German corpus is given
in Figure 2 (right diagram). The two curves of the figure show that despite the afore-
mentioned differences between English and German, basic features of the error rate
distribution are very similar.
6.2 Error Rates for Particular Error Classes
Typographic Errors. The most widespread subclass of errors found in the corpora
are typographic errors. For the primary English corpus, as many as 2.31 of 2.47 hits
(93.5%) can be classified as typing errors.6 The percentage is lower in the German corpus
(2.15/3.86, 55.7%) where e-transformation, -transformation, and s-transformation rep-
resent additional important sources for errors (see below). In absolute numbers, error
rates for typographic errors observed in the two corpora are similar.
The histograms in Figure 4 show the percentage of documents with error rates for
typographic errors in the four intervals [0, 1), [1, 5), [5, 10), and [10,?) for the primary
and secondary English corpora (upper diagrams of Figure 4) and the corresponding
German corpora (lower diagrams of Figure 4). Note again the close similarity between
the two English corpora. The detailed distribution curves, which are similar to the
curves obtained for orthographic errors in Figure 2, are omitted.
Spelling Errors. The two diagrams in Figure 5 show that the error rates found in
the primary English corpus (mean 0.39) are similar to the ones found in the primary
German corpus (mean 0.45). The results presented in Section 5.1 indicate that our error
dictionaries for spelling errors are incomplete. Hence the real number of spelling errors
is probably larger. We also computed error rates for spelling errors in the secondary

corpora; results are presented in Table 20. The tendency observed earlier for ortho-
graphic errors was confirmed: the difference between the two English corpora (mean
0.39 versus mean 0.38) is negligible; for the two German corpora, the difference is larger
(mean 0.45 versus mean 0.58).
OCR Errors. The diagrams in Figure 6 show that most documents do not contain any
OCR errors. Of course this result is not surprising. Probably not all errors that contribute
to the two diagrams are really caused by wrong character recognition. Although some
of the documents with the highest errors were explicitly marked to contain scanned

text, it is natural to assume that the total number of such documents in the corpus is
very small. Ambiguous error types might explain some of the errors found in Figure 6;
see the discussion below. As a matter of fact, the number of OCR errors will grow when
analyzing corpora with many OCRed pages.

e-transformation and -transformation. Figures 7 and 8 show some interesting differ-
ences between the use of both transformations in German Web pages. In the primary
German corpus, e-transformation errors are concentrated in a small class of documents
(documents with rank >480) where we have a nontrivial number of occurrences, lead-
ing to a mean error rate of 0.62. The mean error rate for -transformation is much
smaller (0.19). Still, there are more documents containing an -transformation error.
This indicates that e-transformation is applied more systematically. The small plateau
in Figure 7 is generated by some portion of text that was found in several documents.
The error rates that arise when applying e-transformation in a completely systematic
way are typically larger. In the corpus we found some documents of this kind; since the
rates are too high, these documents are not depicted in the figure.
We also looked for e- and -transformation errors in the documents of the En-
glish general HTML corpus. These errors, which mutate German words, only occur

in a small number of English documents. Whereas German writers strongly prefer the
e-transformation in situations where the correct characters are not available, we find a
clear preference for the -transformation in the English documents.
s-Transformation. Figure 9 shows the distribution of error rates for s-transformation
in the primary German general HTML corpus. Since the corpus contains some Swiss
documents, where ??? is categorically written ?ss? (cf. Section 4.4), the high mean (0.76)
has to be relativized.
Overview. Table 20 summarizes the error rates of all types of errors in the general HTML
corpora. The numbers show that not all errors can be traced back to a unique error
type.

318
Ringlstetter, Schulz, and Mihov Orthographic Errors in Web Pages
6.3 Summary So Far
For both languages, the large majority of all documents has a small number of ortho-
graphic errors. On the other hand, at the ?bad end? of the spectrum, a considerable
number of unacceptable documents with high error rates is found. Mean values for
error rates are strongly influenced by the latter documents; the average error rate for
the Best 80% class is usually much lower. The latter rate should also be considered when
comparing results obtained for two corpora.
Phenomena observed in English corpora seem to be more stable than those for
German: Results obtained for the primary and the secondary English general HTML
corpus are almost identical. Differences between the two German corpora may partially
be explained by names occurring in texts and by special character encoding problems.
Table 20 illustrates this effect, showing the mean error rates for all error types in the
primary and secondary HTML corpora.
The most important error class are typographic errors. In the German documents,
e-transformation and s-transformation represent another typical error source. Whereas
the number of spelling errors is significant, OCR errors do not play an essential role.
Interestingly, the basic form of the distribution curves in Figure 2 is found again in
all corresponding curves for other error types and other corpora (see also Figures 14
and 15); although the absolute numbers for error rates and details are of course distinct.
The close similarity of all distribution curves is striking and gives some evidence to the
assumption that relevant features of the error rate distribution are stable, regardless of
the corpora that are investigated.
7. Differences for Special Corpora
We summarize the error rates that we found in PDF corpora and in corpora for special
thematic fields. In Figures 14 and 15, we present a small selection of distribution curves
for error rates. Similarities of the distribution curves mentioned in the previous section
should also be noted.
7.1 Distribution of Orthographic Errors in the General PDF Corpora
Figure 10 presents the mean error rates for distinct error types found in the general
PDF and (primary) HTML corpus for English. The results show that PDF documents in
general have a better quality than HTML documents. Whereas we have a mean error
rate of 2.47 for orthographic errors in the HTML documents, the corresponding mean
is only 1.38 for PDF. For the Best 80% documents the means are 0.67 (HTML) and 0.38
(PDF).
In principle, the same tendency was observed in the documents of the parallel
German corpora. However, special effects polluted the picture. As we mentioned in
Section 2.1, the conversion of the German PDF documents to ASCII is very error
prone. Although we excluded all converted documents that were obviously garbled
by the conversion, we also found in the remaining documents examples of errors that
were caused by the conversion process. In this sense, the error rates in the original
PDF documents are probably smaller. Mean error rates are 2.15 (HTML) versus 2.04
(PDF) for typographic errors, 0.45 versus 0.41 for spelling errors, 0.13 versus 0.09
for OCR errors, 0.62 versus 0.07 for e-transformation errors, and 0.19 versus 0.16 for
-transformation errors. Since the conversion tool categorically replaces letter ??? by

?ss?, a very high number of s-transformation errors led to the effect that the overall
mean error rate for the German PDF (3.95) is even larger than the rate for the German
HTML (3.86).
7.2 Distribution of Orthographic Errors in Distinct Thematic Corpora
Figure 11 describes the average error rates for orthographic errors and spelling errors
in the English corpora. In almost all thematic areas, mean error rates are larger than
the corresponding means in the general corpora; the differences are significant and
remarkable. With a mean error rate of 2.05 (0.30) for orthographic (spelling) errors,
the English Neurology corpus is very clean and represents an exception. For the Fish
corpus, even the mean error rate for the Best 80% subclass is 2.72. We conjecture that
corpora that are collected without a special thematic focus often contain a large number
of ?professional? and carefully edited Web pages. Web pages for special thematic areas

the simple strategy (cf. Section 2.2). Black rectangles represent mean error rates for the Best 80%
subclass.
320
Ringlstetter, Schulz, and Mihov Orthographic Errors in Web Pages
are perhaps less ?publicity oriented.? Furthermore, as a rule of thumb, documents in
thematic fields related to hobbies (e.g. Fish) contain more orthographic errors than
documents in scientific fields (Holocaust, Neurology). Corpora with a focus on history
seem to occupy a middle position.
In the German corpora we have the means for orthographic/spelling error rates
presented in Table 21; numbers in brackets refer to the Best 80% subclass. The second
column shows that, by and large, the ranking order for thematic areas induced by mean
error rates observed in the English corpora is found again in the German part. The
German corpus Neurology, with its high error rate, does not follow this line. The high
means for the Best 80% subclasses in the German corpora are remarkable and show that
the low quality is not caused by a small number of bad documents.
7.3 Differences between the Two Crawling Strategies
Table 22 summarizes the differences for the English corpora retrieved with the simple
strategy on the one hand and the corpora retrieved with the refined strategy on the other
hand. Numbers represent average error rates for the corpora. Numbers in brackets refer
to the Best 80% subclass.
Surprisingly, all corpora crawled with the refined strategy always have a better
(smaller) average error rate than those retrieved with the simple strategy, pointing to
a significant difference between the two types of collection strategies. An analysis of the
document genres found in the two types of corpora presented in Section 8 offers a good
explanation; see Table 26.
Table 21
Mean error rates for orthographic errors and spelling errors in thematic German corpora.

Neurology G 6.94 (4.48) 7.08 (2.86) 0.51 (0.26) 0.47 (0.00)
Figures 14 and 15 show that the corpora crawled with the refined strategy have a
large number of documents with error rate 0. This special effect is caused by the large
number of short documents that are obtained. For example, the mean length of all the
documents with error rate 0 in the corpus Fish E (2) is 322 (number of lowercase normal
tokens), whereas the average length of the documents in the corpus Fish E (1) is 14,196
(cf. Table 2).
The relative order between the three thematic fields was not affected by the crawling
strategy. For both crawls, the Neurology corpus achieves the best results, followed by
Mushrooms and Fish. The excellent quality of the Best 80% classes obtained with the
refined crawl are remarkable.
For the German variant of the corpora, as Table 23 shows, a more shallow picture
is obtained. For two thematic areas, the simple crawl even leads to lower error rates,
although the difference is small. The ranking order between the three thematic areas
obtained from the two crawls is not the same.
Figure 14 presents the error rates for orthographic errors in the English HTML
corpora Fish, Mushrooms, and Neurology, comparing the simple strategy (left-hand
side diagrams) with the refined strategy (right-hand side diagrams). Figure 15 gives
the error rates for spelling errors in the German HTML corpora Fish, Mushrooms, and
Neurology, again comparing the simple and the refined strategies.
7.4 Summary So Far
PDF corpora were found to have lower error rates. Corpora covering pages from non-
scientific thematic areas often have higher error rates than corpora crawled without a
fixed thematic focus. Error rates in the corpora are influenced by the crawling strategy.
For English texts, refined crawling strategies that collect pages with a strong thematic
focus seem to produce better corpora.
8. Error Rates and Document Genre
Classifying Web documents by genre (Kessler, Nunberg, and Schu?tze 1997; Finn and
Kushmerick 2003; Dimitrova et al 2003) represents one possible way to improve Web
search techniques. Web-based corpus linguistics may benefit from these techniques
since they enable a better control of the kind of language material that is added to
a collection. In this section we want to see which kind of correlation exists between
the error rates observed in a document and its genre. After manual inspection of

hundreds of Web pages, we decided to use the following set of document genres for
our investigations:
 The class Prof contains all Web pages with professional texts from
organizations, enterprises, and administrations. Also, scientific texts,
professional literature, and fiction are added to this class.
 The class Priv contains private homepages and texts written from a
personal point of view. A clue term is the personal pronoun I. Texts of this
form may dominate in a Web page run by an organization. In this case, the
page was classified as Priv.
 The class Chat contains chat and related collections of private statements
and contributions such as guest books, mailing lists, and so forth.

Distribution of error rates in documents (passed/rejected) by the filter F3 for threshold ? = 5
(English test corpus). The left (right) diagram describes the distribution of documents passed
(rejected) by the filter. The average error rate for accepted (rejected) documents is 1.08 (16.81).
 The class Junk contains documents where the language is ?polluted,? for
example, by large lists of erroneous keywords, lists of foreign language
expressions, dominating subparts only consisting of program code, archaic
language, and so forth.
 The class Other contains all other documents. In practice we tried to assign
to each document one of the above four classes, and most documents in
the class Other are (almost) empty files.
Even with this small number of classes, separation issues were sometimes difficult to
address. We did not introduce finer subclasses since we expected that the number of
ambiguous and problematic cases would be multiplied.
Our experiments on document genre were restricted to English corpora. We looked
at the primary general English HTML corpus and on the English corpora for the
domains Fish, Mushrooms, and Neurology. For each of the latter three domains, both
the corpus obtained with the simple crawling strategy and the corpus retrieved with the
refined crawl were taken into account. Hence, a total of 7 corpora were investigated.
8.1 Genre Distribution of the Four Quality Classes
For each corpus, all documents in the classes Worst and Bad were manually classi-
fied, assigning one of the classes Prof, Priv, Chat, Junk, or Other to the document.
From the classes Good and Best, 100 documents were randomly selected and clas-
sified in the same way. Table 24 presents the classification results for the primary
English general HTML corpus. Not surprisingly, classes Chat and Junk dominate at
the bad end of the quality spectrum, whereas class Prof dominates for good doc-
uments. The same tendency was found for all corpora, although the percentage of
Prof documents in distinct quality classes was often larger. To add one further typical
example, Table 25 presents the result for the corpus Fish E (1) retrieved with the simple
crawling strategy. Note that even for the Bad class, 50.62% of the documents are of
type Prof.

side) refer to corpora retrieved with the simple crawling strategy. Letters (2) (diagrams on the
right-hand side) stand for the refined crawling strategy. From the refined crawl (right-hand
sides) a large number of documents without any error hit is obtained. Corpora crawled with the
refined strategy typically contain a large number of short documents (cf. Sections 2.2 and 7.3),
and short documents of good quality often have an error rate 0. A comparison along the vertical
dimension illuminates differences between the three thematic areas: corpora Fish E contain more
errors than corpora Mushrooms E, which contain more errors than the corpora Neurology E.
Mean error rates are 7.08/3.39 [Fish E (1)/Fish E (2)]; 4.10/2.58 [Mushrooms E (1)/Mushrooms E
(2)]; and 2.05/1.77 [Neurology E (1)/Neurology E (2)]. In the diagrams, some documents with
high error rates are omitted to simplify scaling.

corpora retrieved with the simple crawling strategy. Letters (2) (diagrams on the right-hand

short documents without any hits in the error dictionaries. See the discussion in Section 7.3.
Similarly as for English HTML, corpora Fish G contain more errors than corpora Mushrooms G,
which contain more errors than the corpora Neurology G. Mean error rates are 1.35/1.00
[Fish G (1)/Fish G (2)]; 0.78/0.76 [Mushrooms G (1)/Mushrooms G (2)]; and 0.51/0.47
[Neurology G (1)/Neurology G (2)]. In the diagrams, some documents with high error rates
are omitted to simplify scaling.

8.2 Genre Distribution: Simple Crawl versus Refined Crawl
The analysis of genres presented in Table 26 illuminates an important difference be-
tween the thematic corpora retrieved with the simple and the refined crawling strategy:
In the latter corpora, the percentage of documents of type Chat and Junk is lower;
differences are significant. At the same time, corpora retrieved with the refined strategy
contain more documents of type Prof. We conjecture that the open compounds that
were used in the queries for the refined crawl (cf. Section 2.2) represent a kind of ?high-
level language expressions? that are typically used in a professional or scientific context.
With the above background, it is not surprising that the refined crawling strategy leads
to better error rates.
8.3 Error Rates for Genres
Table 27 presents estimates for the mean error rates obtained for the distinct document
genres in the seven corpora. These numbers represent estimates since not all documents

of the classes Good and Best were classified. In all corpora, the mean error rate for class
Prof is better than the rate for class Priv, which is better than the rate for class Chat.
The results indicate that the error rate of a document might be an interesting feature
for genre classification: High error rates typically point to documents of the genres Junk
and Chat; excellent error rates typically point to documents of type Prof. Results for
the Neurology corpora indicate that ?scientific Chat/Junk? may come with low error
rates.
8.4 Summary So Far
An obvious correlation exists between the genre of a document and its error rate. Error
rates might be used as one feature for genre classification. The analysis of genres helps
one to understand the differences between corpora retrieved with distinct crawling
strategies and the error rates observed in the corpora.
9. Filtering Methods
The figures seen in the previous sections show that corpora collected from the Web
typically contain a non-negligible number of documents with an unacceptable number
of orthographic errors. We now turn to the question of how to use error dictionaries for
recognizing and filtering Web pages with a high percentage of errors, thus excluding
them from the corpus construction process. The question of what should be considered
as a ?high percentage? has to be answered for each application. Generally speaking we
would like to exclude at least those documents that are found at the right end of the
diagrams presented in the previous sections.
Definition
By a filter, we mean a pair F = ?D,?? consisting of an error dictionary, D, and a
filter threshold, ?. The filter rejects a text document (Web page) T iff the average
number of entries of D that are found among 1,000 tokens of T exceeds ?.
As a matter of fact, we may use the maximal error dictionaries for filtering. For
some applications, small error dictionaries, which occupy less space and are easier
to handle, may be advantageous. The results presented below show that when one
uses a more rigid filter threshold ?, the filtering effect achieved with ?small? error
dictionaries is very similar to the effect when using the maximal error dictionaries.
With an obvious interpolation, this observation supports the assumption that the
328
Ringlstetter, Schulz, and Mihov Orthographic Errors in Web Pages
incompleteness of our maximal error dictionaries does not seriously reduce their fil-
tering capacities.
9.1 Distribution of Error Frequencies
Since error dictionaries are necessarily incomplete in the sense that not all possible
errors can be covered, it is natural to ask if filters of the above-mentioned form
can work. We shall see below that even filters with small error dictionaries are use-
ful. The reason is that the frequency of orthographic errors in the Web follows a
Zipf-like7 distribution. Since a relatively small number of erroneous tokens already
covers a substantial number of all error occurrences, it should not be surprising that
even small error dictionaries help to identify pages with many errors. In Figure 12, we
show the logarithmic frequencies of errors in a 1.4-terabyte subcorpus retrieved from the
Web in 1999 (?Web-in-a-box?). The upper diagram shows the distribution of all errors
from the maximal English error dictionary, Derr(English,all), in English Web pages. Only
errors with at least two occurrences are covered. Similarly the lower diagram shows the
distribution of errors from Derr(German,all) in German Web pages.
9.2 Basic Filter Scenario
Suppose we are given a collection of Web pages, C. We may fix a user-defined threshold
? in terms of the average number of errors per 1,000 tokens that we are willing to accept
in a document to be added to our corpus. A document where the average number of
errors per 1,000 tokens does not exceed ? is called acceptable, other documents are
called unacceptable. In practice, since we cannot count real errors, a token is considered
erroneous if and only if it occurs in one of our error dictionaries. In Section 5, we have
seen that the number of entries of the error dictionary found in a text yields a lower
approximation for the real number of errors.
In terms of information retrieval, acceptable documents can be considered as rele-
vant documents that we would like to retrieve for ?query? ?. To extend this analogy,
we define the answer set of a filter F w.r.t. C as the set of all documents in C that are
passed by F . With these notions we may now define the parameters? precision and
recall.
Definition
Let ?, C, and F as above. The precision of F with respect to ? and C is the
percentage of acceptable documents in the answer set of F . The recall of F with
respect to ? and C is the number of acceptable documents in the answer set of F
divided by the number of all acceptable documents in C.
In the remainder of the section, we define and evaluate filters for the English and
German general HTML corpora, which are denoted CE and CG, respectively. We consider
three user-defined thresholds: ? = 10, ? = 5, and ? = 1. The first bound is meant to
exclude a small number of documents with an extraordinary number of orthographic
errors. The second bound is more ambitious. The third bound might be used in
7 Zipf?s law describes the frequency of words in large corpora. It states that the i-th most frequent word
appears as many times as the most frequent one divided by i?, for some constant ? ? 1.
329
Computational Linguistics Volume 32, Number 3
situations where high accuracy is needed and we want to retrieve only documents with
a negligible number of orthographic errors.
9.3 Automated Filter Construction
We define a hierarchy of filters
F1 = ?D1,?1?,F2 = ?D2,?2?,F3 = ?D3,?3?, . . .
Filters Fk with higher index k generally lead to better results. On the negative side, they
are more complex in terms of the number of entries of Dk. In the following description
we generally assume that a user-defined threshold ? has been fixed. For simplicity, we
refer to the construction of filters for the English corpus, CE. The same construction was
used, mutatis mutandis, for CG. All filters are computed automatically on the basis of
training data. For training, two inputs were used.
1. Ranked error list. We computed a list of all entries of the maximal English
error dictionary, Derr(English,all), that occur at least twice in the corpus
Web-in-a-box (cf. Section 9.1). The list was ordered by descending
frequency of occurrence, as in Figure 12. The resulting ranked error list
contains 1, 175, 894 entries.
2. 2. Training corpus. The corpus CE was randomly split into a training
subcorpus (427 documents) and a test subcorpus (407 documents).8
From the training corpus, all documents were excluded that did not
contain at least five distinct errors from the ranked error list, leaving
384 documents.
Definition of Filters. The error dictionary Dk for filter Fk was defined as the minimal
initial segment S of the ranked error list such that each unacceptable document in the
training corpus contains at least k distinct entries of the segment S. The threshold ?k
was defined as the minimal average number of occurrences of entries of Dk per 1,000
tokens in an unacceptable document of the training corpus. These entries need not
be distinct.
Clearly, with the given threshold we achieve a precision of 100% on the training
corpus. The philosophy behind this selection of a threshold is simple: We do not want
to add any unacceptable document to the corpus to be built. Precision is much more
important than recall, as long as a substantial number of documents is retrieved. As
a matter of fact, we cannot expect a 100% precision on the test corpus. However, our
results show that the loss of precision is not significant.
9.4 Filtering Results for English General HTML Corpus
In what follows we consider the three user-defined thresholds ? = 10, ? = 5, and ? = 1.
For each of the filters F1 = (D1,?1), . . . ,F5 = (D5,?5), as defined earlier, Table 28 shows
8 The distinct sizes of both corpora seem to indicate that the random selection was not perfectly balanced.
We ignored this problem, which does not influence the construction.

and the precision and recall values achieved with the filter on the training and test

Baselines. When treating the complete test corpus as a ?naive? answer set (recall 100%),
we obtain
1. for ? = 10, a precision of 94.76%, corresponding to 380 acceptable and 21
unacceptable documents,
2. for ? = 5, a precision of 87.28%, corresponding to 350 acceptable and 51
unacceptable documents.
3. for ? = 1, a precision of 57.10%, corresponding to 229 acceptable and 172
unacceptable documents.
For ? = 10, with a precision (recall) of 99.40% (87.63%) on the test corpus, the filter
F3 represents a good compromise between size and quality. Precision is almost optimal.
The answer set for the filter contains only one unacceptable document with an error rate
of 13.24, which is very close to the threshold.
For ? = 5, using the filter F3 we obtain a precision (recall) of 97.47% (97.42%). An
inspection of the nine unacceptable documents in the answer set of the filter shows that
they come very close to the bound ? = 5. Note that error dictionaries D1, D2, and D3
are larger than the corresponding dictionaries for the threshold k = 10 due to the larger
number of unacceptable documents in the training corpus.
For ? = 1, using the filter F3 we obtain a precision (recall) of 97.02% (85.58%). There
are six unacceptable documents in the answer set, all with an error rate below 2. The
numbers in Table 28 show how a more rigid (smaller) filter threshold compensates for

the reduced size of error dictionaries essentially without sacrificing precision and with
a modest loss of recall. To illustrate the effect of filtering, yet from another perspective,
Figure 13 presents the distribution of error rates (number of entries from the maximal
English error dictionary Derr(English,all) per 1,000 tokens) in the answer set and in the
set of documents rejected by the filter F3 constructed for the user-defined threshold ? =
5. The filter was evaluated on the test subcorpus. The figure shows that almost all docu-
ments passed (rejected) by the filter have an error frequency below (beyond) 5 errors per
1,000 tokens.
9.5 Filtering Results for the German General HTML Corpus
For computing the ranked error list, a list with the frequencies of 18, 624, 436 tokens in
German Web pages was used. Via intersection with the list of all entries of the maximal
German error dictionary, Derr(German,all), we obtained a ranked error list with 454, 709
entries. The training and test corpora contain 314 and 308 documents, respectively, from
the German general HTML corpus. Since the results are similar to the English case,
we only point to some differences. Frequencies decrease more rapidly in the German
ranked error list, as may be seen in Figure 12. In the German list, the top-ranked part is
dominated by e/-transformation errors and errors where the letter ? is replaced by ss.
The 10 top-ranked entries and their frequencies are shown in Table 29. This special class
of frequent errors leads to small filter dictionaries. For example, the filter dictionary for
? = 10, k = 5 has 16,277 entries, and the dictionary for ? = 5, k = 5 has 127,023 entries.
On the other hand, the recall values achieved with the dictionaries in general are lower
than in the English case.
10. Example Applications
Obviously, the methods described above are very useful for all corpus tools that visually
present linguistic data from Web pages (words, n-grams, concordances, phrases, sen-
tences, aligned bilingual material, etc.) to the user. Filters help to exclude inappropriate
pages. In the remaining data, tokens that represent entries of the error dictionaries can
be marked. Depending on the application, the system may then decide to suppress this
material or to add a warning when presenting it. In the remainder of this section, two
case studies are presented that demonstrate the usefulness of filtering techniques and
error dictionaries in distinct applications.
10.1 Text Correction with Crawled Dictionaries
It has often been observed that fixed handcrafted dictionaries only have a modest
coverage when applied to new texts and corpora.9 Still, for various text processing tasks,
dictionaries with high coverage are needed. The generation of crawled dictionaries that
collect the vocabulary of appropriate Web pages is one way to obtain a better coverage.
As a matter of fact, the quality of these dictionaries suffers from orthographic errors in
the analyzed pages. Using the above filters helps to reduce the number of errors that are
9 Kukich (1992) describes an experiment by Walker and Amsler (1986): ?Nearly two thirds (61%) of the
words in the Merriam-Webster Seventh Collegiate Dictionary did not appear in an eight million word corpus
of New York Times news wire text, and, conversely, almost two-thirds (64%) of the words in the text were
not in the dictionary.?

imported. In order to further improve a crawled dictionary, we may either eliminate all
words that represent entries of the error dictionaries, or we may mark these words for
a manual inspection. In what follows we report on an experiment in the area of lexical
text correction where these techniques improved:
1. the quality of crawled dictionaries by avoiding erroneous entries,
2. the accuracy of lexical text correction achieved with these dictionaries,
using a high-level text correction system (Strohmaier et al 2003a, 2003b).
Correction Strategy. Ignoring details, we used the following correction strategy10: For
each token11 of the input text, the most similar words are retrieved from the dictionary
as a set of correction candidates. In many cases the token will be found in the dictionary
and represents a correction candidate with optimal similarity. Based on (1) the similarity
between text token and correction candidate and (2) the frequency of the correction
candidate in a corpus, each candidate receives a score. If the score of the best candidate
exceeds a given threshold ?, the token is replaced by this candidate. In the other case, the
token is left unmodified. A good balance between similarity and frequency information
in the score is obtained via training. The threshold, which is also optimized via training,
guarantees that the input token is only replaced if additional confidence is available
that the best correction candidate in fact represents the corrected version of the token.
In the experiment described below, the system was trained on a corpus for the domain
Mushrooms. The evaluation corpus is from the domain Fish. Hence, the two corpora
are disjoint and cover distinct thematic areas. More details on the correction system can
be found in Strohmaier et al (2003b).
Garbled Input Text for Correction. We collected 10 texts from the domain Fish, all
containing a nontrivial number of errors. Texts were retrieved from the Web, using
queries to Google with spelling errors, such as fish anglers infomation realy. We checked
that the texts do not contain paragraphs that are also found in the documents of the
corpora Fish E introduced in Section 2.2. The concatenation of the 10 texts was used as

input to the text correction system. For the evaluation, a corrected version of the full text
was manually created. The full text contains 17,697 tokens of which 418 (2.36%) were
found to be erroneous.
Background Dictionaries for Correction. As a baseline, a first crawled dictionary
Dcrawl with 505,652 entries was built, collecting all words from the documents in the
corpus Fish E (1). A second dictionary D+Fcrawl used only those pages that were not
rejected by the filter for threshold ? = 2, based on the maximal English error dic-
tionary Derr(English,all).12 In this case, 324 documents passed the filter, whereas 186
were rejected. In this case we obtained 291,065 entries. Deleting in D+Fcrawl all words that
represent entries of Derr(English,all), a third dictionary D
+F+ED
crawl with 269,079 entries was
computed.
Note that we did not extend D+Fcrawl and D
+F+ED
crawl by analyzing an additional set of
filtered Web pages. Hence, D+Fcrawl is in fact a subdictionary of Dcrawl, and similarly for
D+F+EDcrawl and D
+F
crawl. This explains why the coverage of D
+F
crawl (D
+F+ED
crawl ) is smaller than
the coverage of Dcrawl (D
+F
crawl); see below. With an extended filtered crawl, even better
coverage and accuracy results would probably be possible.
Evaluation Results. We then compared the lexical coverage (percentage of tokens of
the correct version of the input text found in the dictionary) and correction accuracy
(percentage of correct tokens after automated correction) for each of the three dictio-
naries. The results are presented in Table 30. The accuracy of the input text is 97.64%.
The fifth column gives the improvement in accuracy, taking the input text as a baseline.
The last column mentions the number of erroneous tokens in the text that are found in
the respective error dictionary.
Note that the use of the filtered corpus leads to a measurable improvement in
correction accuracy. The second step in which we eliminate all entries of the error
dictionaries in the correction dictionary leads to an additional gain.
Overproduction and Underproduction of the Error Dictionary. As mentioned above,
418 tokens of the input text represented proper errors. From these, 254 (60.77%) turned
out to be entries of the maximal English error dictionary Derr(English,all). Note that
this value for underproduction is very compatible with our estimates in Section 5.
Remarkably, only seven of the correct tokens of the input text occurred in the error
dictionary.
Analyzing the Effect of Using Filters and Error Dictionaries. The most important error
source in the correction process are erroneous tokens of the text that?by accident?
represent entries of the crawled dictionaries. Using the above strategy, these false
friends are only replaced by another word w of the correction dictionary if overwhelm-
ing frequency information is available that leads to a preference of w after computing
the balanced score for similarity and frequency. The dictionary Dcrawl contains 262 of the
418 erroneous tokens of the text. The dictionary D+Fcrawl, which collects the vocabulary
of filtered pages, contains only 92 erroneous tokens. After eliminating all entries of the
maximal error dictionary, the new dictionary D+F+EDcrawl contains only 49 false friends.
Note that the latter tokens represent errors not contained in the error dictionary. A
very interesting additional number is the following: when eliminating in Dcrawl all
12 Other filter thresholds for ? = 1, 0.5, and 0 were also tested and led to very similar accuracy values.

the entries that are found in Derr(English,all), the resulting dictionary contains 105
erroneous tokens of the text. This shows that the filtering step eliminates 56 (= 105 ? 49)
erroneous tokens of the text that are not found in the error dictionary and proves that
a two-step procedure?first using filters for crawling pages, then eliminating entries of
error dictionaries afterwards?leads to optimal results.
10.2 Generating Translation Data from Parallel Corpora
Parallel texts represent an important resource for automatic acquisition of bilingual
dictionaries. Since only a small number of large parallel corpora are available, which
are moreover specialized both with respect to form and contents, the Web represents
an important archive for mining parallel texts (Resnik and Smith 2003). When building
up bilingual dictionaries for machine translation, or when presenting parallel phrases
to users, correctness is an important issue. Hence, it is interesting to see how error
dictionaries help to reduce errors in parallel corpora. Our methods can be applied to
any kind of parallel corpus. For our experiments we used the freely available Europarl
corpus.13 The corpus covers the proceedings of the European Parliament 1996?2001 in
11 official languages of the European Union. We only analyzed the English and German
versions of the parallel texts. The 488 documents in the corpus are of an excellent quality.
Our goal was to find English and German texts with a nontrivial number of errors (if
any) and to detect these errors. Since the overproduction of error dictionaries in very
accurate texts is high, the problem is challenging. The maximal error dictionaries for
the two languages were used to determine the error rate of each document. Table 31
shows the twenty documents with the highest error rates for both the English and the
German subcollection of the corpora. Columns 4 and 5 describe the number of tokens
that represent entries of the respective error dictionary and the number of real errors
among these hits. The results show that when analyzing very accurate texts, the error
rate is not always a safe indicator for a corresponding number of real errors. Still, the
experiment isolates 246 real errors, only looking at 40 documents. When collecting
translation correspondences, we may simply discard all phrases/sentences with a hit
in an error dictionary, together with their aligned counterparts. Many translation pairs
with errors will be avoided. Given the length of the documents, the number of hits of
the error dictionaries is small, hence the loss of recall is not essential. In this way our

11. Conclusion
In this article we investigated the distribution of orthographic errors of distinct types in
the English and German Web. Experiments based on a variety of very large error dic-
tionaries showed that Web corpora typically contain a non-negligible number of pages
336
Ringlstetter, Schulz, and Mihov Orthographic Errors in Web Pages
with an unacceptable number of orthographic errors. Typing errors represent the most
important subclass. In German Web pages, errors resulting from character encoding
problems represent another important category. In our experiments, PDF documents
were found to contain less orthographic errors than HTML documents, and corpora
covering specific thematic areas were found to contain more errors than collections of
?general? pages without such a focus. Some differences were remarkable; in particular,
our corpora for special thematic areas related to hobbies contain many pages with a
high number of orthographic errors. We also found that mean error rates are influenced
by the collection strategy. Specific crawling strategies help to avoid chat and junk while
attracting professional documents. Since document genre and error rates are correlated,
refined crawling strategies may help to reduce mean error rates.
Error dictionaries, even subdictionaries of modest size, can be used as filters that
help to detect and eliminate pages with many orthographic errors. Filters with user-
defined thresholds work well for both languages. Obviously, the possibility of deleting
pages with many orthographic errors and of marking all entries of error dictionaries
in the remaining documents opens a wide range of interesting applications in distinct
areas of corpus linguistics. To exemplify possible applications we showed how to im-
prove the quality of Web-crawled dictionaries for text correction. With these filtered dic-
tionaries, higher values for correction accuracy were obtained than with those directly
obtained from Web crawls. In a second experiment, we showed how error dictionar-
ies may be used to improve the automated collection of translation correspondences,
avoiding translation pairs with orthographic errors.
Going beyond corpus linguistics, it might be interesting to design (special modes of)
Web search engines where the error rate of a given document is used as one parameter
in the ranking of answers. In many search scenarios, answer documents with a large
number of orthographic errors appear to be less reliable, and the user might wish to
concentrate on ?professional? or carefully edited Web pages.
In our practical work we found that the collection and analysis of very large Web
corpora is difficult for many reasons. For example, it is not clear how to treat pages
with artificial vocabulary that is only introduced to obtain a better ranking. We learned
that often these junk lists are intensionally enriched with many orthographic errors to
obtain a better ranking, in particular for erroneous queries. In our experiments, some
of these pages were found immediately, looking at error rates, and excluded. Later,
when inspecting documents for genre classification, other less eye-catching examples
were found. Some portions of text occurred in several documents. The conversion of
Web pages into ASCII represents a potential source for new errors. In particular the
conversion of German PDF documents to ASCII turned out to be very error prone.
Nonstandard vocabulary (special names, foreign language expressions, archaic lan-
guage, programming code, slang, etc.) is another source that makes various pages
inappropriate for corpus construction.
One step for future work is the development of special dictionaries for frequent
foreign language expressions, archaic language, programming code, and slang. Special
dictionaries for these expressions would not only help to detect and exclude pages with
a high amount of nonstandard vocabulary, but they could also be used as additional
filters in the construction of error dictionaries. The results in Section 5.2 indicate that
the overproduction of our error dictionaries could be reduced in a significant way by
eliminating entries that represent expressions of the earlier-mentioned type. As a matter
of fact, new types of spelling errors were found during the experiments described
earlier. It might be interesting to enlarge the error dictionaries for spelling errors, taking
the new patterns into account.

We also found that enlarged error dictionaries that store with each garbled entry
the correct word from which it was derived are very useful for error correction. In
contrast to our first intuitions, the number of ambiguities arising from this correction
strategy is small, and the predictive power of enlarged error dictionaries is high.
More details on text correction with error dictionaries will be given in a forthcoming
paper.

Abstract
Most word segmentation methods em-
ployed in Chinese Information Retrieval
systems are based on a static dictionary
or a model trained against a manually
segmented corpus. These general seg-
mentation approaches may not be opti-
mal because they disregard information
within semantic units. We propose a novel
method for improving word-based Chi-
nese IR, which performs segmentation ac-
cording to the tightness of phrases. In
order to evaluate the effectiveness of our
method, we employ a new test collection
of 203 queries, which include a broad dis-
tribution of phrases with different tight-
ness values. The results of our experi-
ments indicate that our method improves
IR performance as compared with a gen-
eral word segmentation approach. The ex-
periments also demonstrate the need for
the development of better evaluation cor-
pora.
1 Introduction
What distinguishes Chinese Information Retrieval
from information retrieval (IR) in other languages
is the challenge of segmenting the queries and the
documents, created by the lack of word delimiters.
In general, there are two categories of segmenters:
character-based methods and word-based meth-
ods. Despite the superior performance of bigram
segmenters (Nie et al, 2000; Huang et al, 2000;
Foo and Li, 2004), word-based approaches con-
tinue to be investigated because of their applica-
tion in sophisticated IR tasks such as cross lan-
guage IR, and within techniques such as query ex-
pansion (Nie et al, 2000; Peng et al, 2002a).
Most word-based segmenters in Chinese IR are
either rule-based models, which rely on a lexi-
con, or statistical-based models, which are trained
on manually segmented corpora (Zhang et al,
2003). However, the relationship between the ac-
curacy of Chinese word segmentation and the per-
formance of Chinese IR is non-monotonic. Peng
et al (2002b) reported that segmentation meth-
ods achieving segmentation accuracy higher than
90% according to a manual segmentation standard
yield no improvement in IR performance. They
further argued that IR often benefits from splitting
compound words that are annotated as single units
by manual segmentation.
The essence of the problem is that there is no
clear definition of word in Chinese. Experiments
have shown only about 75% agreement among na-
tive speakers regarding the correct word segmen-
tation (Sproat et al, 1996). While units such as
??	? (peanut) and ???|? (match maker)
should clearly be considered as a single term in
Chinese IR, compounds such as ?????? (ma-
chine learning) are more controversial.1
Xu et al (2009) proposed a ?continuum hy-
pothesis? that rejects a clean binary classifica-
tion of Chinese semantic units as either compo-
sitional or non-compositional. Instead, they intro-
duced the notion of a tightness measure, which
quantifies the degree of compositionality. On
this tightness continuum, at one extreme are non-
1This issue is also present to a certain degree in languages
that do use explicit delimiters, including English (Halpern,
2000; McCarthy et al, 2003; Guenthner and Blanco, 2004).
55
compositional semantic units, such as ???
|? (match maker), and at the other end are se-
quences of consecutive words with no depen-
dency relationship, such as ??0??? (Shang-
hai where). In the middle of the spectrum are
compositional compounds such as ??????
(machine learning) and phrases such as ?thB
?? (legitimate income).
In this paper, we propose a method to ap-
ply the concept of semantic tightness to Chinese
IR, which refines the output of a general Chi-
nese word segmenter using tightness information.
In the first phase, we re-combine multiple units
that are considered semantically tight into single
terms. In the second phase, we break single units
that are not sufficiently tight. The experiments in-
volving two different IR systems demonstrate that
the newmethod improves IR performance as com-
pared to the general segmenter.
Most Chinese IR systems are evaluated on the
data from the TREC 5 and TREC 6 competi-
tions (Huang et al, 2000; Huang et al, 2003;
Nie et al, 2000; Peng et al, 2002a; Peng et al,
2002b; Shi and Nie, 2009). That data contains
only 54 queries, which are linked to relevancy-
judged documents. During our experiments, we
found the TREC query data is ill-suited for ana-
lyzing the effects of compound segmentation on
Chinese IR. For this reason, we created an addi-
tional set of queries based on the TREC corpus,
which includes a wide variety of semantic com-
pounds.
This paper is organized as follows. After sum-
marizing related work on Chinese IR and word
segmentation studies, we introduce the measure
of semantic tightness. Section 4 describes the in-
tegration of the semantic tightness measure into
an IR system. Section 5 discusses the available
data for Chinese IR evaluation, as well as an ap-
proach to acquire new data. Section 6 presents the
results of our method on word segmentation and
IR. A short conclusion wraps up and gives direc-
tions for future work.
2 Related Work
The impact of different Chinese word segmen-
tation methods on IR has received extensive at-
tention in the literature (Nie et al, 2000; Peng
et al, 2002a; Peng et al, 2002b; Huang et al,
2000; Huang et al, 2003; Liu et al, 2008; Shi
and Nie, 2009). For example, Foo and Li (2004)
tested the effects of manual segmentation and var-
ious character-based segmentations. In contrast
with most related work that only reports the over-
all performance, they provide an in-depth analysis
of query results. They note that a small test col-
lection diminishes the significance of the results.
In a series of papers on Chinese IR, Peng
and Huang compared various segmentation meth-
ods in IR, and proposed a new segmentation
method (Peng et al, 2002a; Peng et al, 2002b;
Huang et al, 2000; Huang et al, 2003). Their
experiments suggest that the relationship between
segmentation accuracy and retrieval performance
is non-monotonic, ranging from 44%-95%. They
hypothesize that weak word segmenters are able
to improve the accuracy of Chinese IR by break-
ing compound words into smaller constituents.
Shi and Nie (2009) proposed a probability-
based IR score function that combines a unigram
score with a word score according to ?phrase in-
separability.? Candidates for words in the query
are selected by a standard segmentation program.
Their results show a small improvement in com-
parison with a static combination of unigram and
word methods.
Liu et al (2008) is the research most similar
to our proposed method. They point out that cur-
rent segmentation methods which treat segmenta-
tion as a classification problem are not suitable
for Chinese IR. They propose a ranking support
vector machine (SVM) model to predict the inter-
nal association strength (IAS) between characters,
which is similar to our concept of tightness. How-
ever, they do not analyze their segmentation ac-
curacy with respect to a standard corpus, such as
Chinese Treebank. Their method does not reliably
segment function words, mistakenly identifying
?{|? (?s people) as tight, for example. Unlike
their approach, our segmentation method tackles
the problem by combining the tightness measure
with a general segmentation method.
Chinese word segmentation is closely related
to multiword expression extraction. McCarthy et
al. (2003) investigate various statistical measures
of compositionality of candidate multiword verbs.
56
Silva et al (1999) propose a new compositional-
ity measure based on statistical information. The
main difference with Xu et al?s measure is that
the latter is focused on word sense disambigua-
tion. In terms of multiword expressions in IR,
Vechtomova (2001) propose several approaches,
such as query expansion, to incorporating English
multiword expressions in IR. Braschler and Rip-
plinger (2004) analyze the effect of stemming and
decompounding on German text retrieval. How-
ever, Chinese compound segmentation in IR is a
thorny issue and needs more investigation for the
reasons mentioned earlier.
3 Semantic Tightness Continuum
We adopt the method developed by (Xu et al,
2009) for Chinese semantic unit tightness mea-
sure, which was shown to outperform the point-
wise mutual information method. For the sake
of completeness we briefly describe the basic ap-
proach here. The input of the measure is the prob-
ability distribution of a unit?s segmentation pat-
terns, i.e., potential segmentation candidates. The
output is a tightness value; the greater the value,
the tighter the unit. In this paper, we focus on 4-
gram sequences because 4-character compounds
are the most prominent in Chinese. There are
eight possible segmentations of any 4-character
sequence: ?ABCD,? ?A|BCD,? ?A|B|CD,? etc.
For a sequence of n characters, there are 2n?1 po-
tential segmentations. Equation 1 below defines
the tightness measure.
ratio =
?
??
??
?P t(s)
max(?P t(s1|s2))+ 1N
if ?P t(s) > ?
undef otherwise
(1)
In Equation 1, ?P t(s) stands for frequencies of
segmentation patterns of a potential semantic unit
s; Pt(s1|s2) is a pattern which segments the unit
s into two parts: s1 and s2; ? is a threshold to
exclude rare patterns; and N is a smoothing factor
which is set as the number of documents. Note
that when the first part of the denominator is zero,
the ratio of the unit will be very high. Intuitively,
the lack of certain separating patterns in the data
is evidence for the tightness of the units.
4 Application to Chinese IR
We propose a novel approach to segmentation
for Chinese IR which is based on the tight-
ness measure. Our segmenter revises the out-
put of a general segmenter according to the tight-
ness of units. The intuition behind our method
is that segmentation based on tightness of units
will lead to better IR performance. For exam-
ple, keeping ??CF? (Pinatubo) as a unit
should lead to better results than segmenting it
into ??(skin)|(include)|C(picture)|F(large)?.
On the other hand, segmenting the compositional
phrase ?)?)? (Kuwait country) into ?)?
(Kuwait)|)(country)? can improve recall. We
revise an initial segmentation in two steps: first,
we combine components that should not have
been separated, such as ??CF? (Pinatubo);
second, we split units which are compositional,
such as ?)?)? (Kuwait country).
In order to combine components, we first
extract 4-gram non-compositional compounds
whose tightness values are greater than a thresh-
old ?1 in a reference corpus, and then revise a
general segmenter by combining two separated
words if their combination is in the list. This ap-
proach is similar to the popular longest match first
method (LMF), but with segmentation chunks in-
stead of characters, and with the compound list
serving as the lexicon. For example, consider
a sequence ?ABCDEFGHIGK,? which a general
segmenter annotates as ?ABC|D|E|F|G|HI|GK.?
If our compound list constructed according to the
tightness measure contains {?DEFG?}, the re-
vised segmentation will be ?ABC|DEFG|HI|GK.?
Units of length less than 4 are segmented by using
the LMF rule against a dictionary.
In order to split a compositional unit, we set the
additional thresholds ?2, ?3, and ?4, and employ
the segmentation rules in Equation 2. The intu-
ition comes from the pattern lattice of a unit (Fig-
ure 1). For the patterns on the same level, the most
frequent pattern suggests the most reasonable seg-
mentation. For the patterns on different levels, the
frequency of each level indicates the tightness of
the unit.
57
Figure 1. The Lattice of the 8 Patterns.
if
v1 = ?Pt(ABCD)max(?Pt(A|BCD),?Pt(AB|CD),?Pt(ABC|D))+ 1N
> ?2
then ?ABCD? is one unit;
else if
v2 =
max(?Pt(A|BCD),?Pt(AB|CD),?Pt(ABC|D))+ 1N
max(?Pt(A|B|CD),?Pt(A|BC|D),?Pt(AB|C|D))+ 1N
> ?3
then ?ABCD? is segmented into two parts;
else if
v3 =
max(?Pt(A|B|CD),?Pt(A|BC|D),?Pt(AB|C|D))+ 1N
?Pt(A|B|C|D)+ 1N
> ?4
then ?ABCD? is segmented into three parts;
else
?ABCD? is segmented into four parts;
(2)
We apply the rules in Equation 2 to the se-
quence of 4-grams, with simple voting for select-
ing the segmentation pattern. For example, within
the sequence ?ABCDEF,? three 4-gram patterns
are considered: ?ABCD,? ?BCDE,? and ?CDEF.?
If only one of the 4-grams contains a segmentation
delimiter, the insertion of the delimiter depends
only upon that 4-gram. If two 4-grams contain the
same delimiter, the insertion of the delimiter de-
pends upon the two 4-grams. If the two 4-grams
disagree on the segmentation, a confidence value
is calculated as in Equation 3,
confidence = vi ? ?i+1, (3)
where i ? [1, 2, 3]. If three 4-grams contain the
same delimiter, voting is employed to decide the
segmentation. Returning to our example, suppose
that the first 4-gram is segmented as ?A|B|C|D,?
the second as ?BC|DE,? and the third as ?C|DE|F.?
Then the segmentation delimiter between ?A? and
?B? is inserted, but the delimiter between ?B? and
?C? depends on the confidence values of the first
two segmentation patterns. Finally, the delimiter
between ?C? and ?D? depends on the result of vot-
ing among the three 4-gram segmentations.
The two steps of combining and splitting can
either be applied in succession or separately. In
the former case, ?1 must be greater or equal to ?2.
In the remainder of this paper, we refer to the first
step as ?Tight Combine,? and to the second step
applied after the first step as ?Tight Split.? Note
that the second method can be used to segment
sentences directly instead of revising the output of
a general segmenter. This method, which we refer
to as ?Online Tight,? has the same shortcoming
as the method of Liu et al (2008), namely it fre-
quently fails to segment function words. For ex-
ample, it erroneously identifies ?{|? (?s people)
as tight. Therefore, we do not attempt to embed it
into the IR systems discussed in Section 6.
5 Test Collection
We analyzed the currently available Chinese test
collection of TREC, and found it unsuitable for
evaluating different strategies of compound seg-
mentation. One problem with the TREC data is
that the Chinese queries (topic titles) have too
many keywords. According to the output of ICT-
CLAS, a general segmenter, the average length of
Chinese queries is 12.2 words; in contrast, the av-
erage length of English ad-hoc queries in TREC-
5 and 6 (English topics 251-350) is 4.7. Even if
we use English translation of the Chinese queries
instead, the average length is still more than 7
words. The problem with long queries is that
they introduce complicating effects that interact
in ways difficult to understand. An example is
the co-occurrence between different keywords in
the base corpus. Sometimes a completely correct
segmentation causes a decrease in IR performance
because the score function assigns a higher score
to less important terms in a topic. For example,
for query 47 (Trec-6 dataset), ?9F5??C
F????????S??? (Philippines,
Mount Pinatubo, volcanic ash, magma, eruption),
preserving the unit Pinatubo makes the average
precision drop from 0.76 to 0.62 as compared to
the segmentation ??||C|F?. The score of the
58
unit is lower than that the sum of its components,
which results in a relatively low ranking for some
relevant documents. Another problem with the
TREC Chinese test collection is the small number
of queries (54). The number of of queries contain-
ing non-compositional words is smaller still. Sim-
ilarly, the other available corpus, NTCIR, com-
prises only 50 queries. In order to be confident of
our results, we would like to have a more substan-
tial number of queries containing units of varying
tightness.
Because of the shortcomings of available data
sets, we created our own test collection. There are
three components that define an IR test collection:
a query set, a corpus from which relevant docu-
ments are retrieved, and relevance judgements for
each query. Our criteria for gathering these com-
ponents are as follows.
First, the set of queries should contain both
tight queries and loose queries. For example,
there should be tight queries such as ???|?
(match maker), loose queries such as ??00?
(Shanghai customs), and queries with tightness
values in between, such as ?????? (machine
learning). Furthermore, the queries should be re-
alistic, rather than constructed by introspection.
In order to meet these requirements we randomly
chose 4-gram noun phrases (tagged by ICTCLAS)
from the TREC corpus. 51 queries are from a real
data set, the Sogou query logs2. The remaining
152 queries, which are selected manually based
on the initial 51 queries, represent queries that IR
system users are likely to enter. For example,
queries of locations and organizations are more
likely than queries such as ?how are you.? Fi-
nally, the queries should not be too general (i.e.,
resulting in too many relevant documents found),
nor too specific (no relevant documents). There-
fore, we selected the 4-grams which had the cor-
responding document frequency in the TREC cor-
pus between 30 and 300.
The second set of criteria concerns the rele-
vance judgements of documents. As our retrieval
corpus, we adopted the TREC Mandarin corpus,
which contains 24,959 documents. Because of re-
source limitation, we used the Minimum Test Col-

lection (MTC) method (Carterette et al, 2006).
The method pools documents in such a way that
the documents which are best for discriminating
between different IR systems are judged first. We
applied this method on a document set that con-
tains all of the top 100 results of 8 IR systems
(two score functions, tf*idf and BM25, 4 index-
ing methods, unigram, bigram, ICTCLAS seg-
mentation, and our Tight Combine segmentation).
The systems were implemented with the Lucene
framework (http://lucene.apache.org/).
The last criterion determines which document
is relevant to a query. Annotators? opinions vary
about whether a document is relevant to a topic.
Is having the query in a document enough to be
the criterion of relevance? For the query ?Bei-
jing airport,? should the document that contains
the sentence ?Chairman Mao arrived at the Bei-
jing airport yesterday,? be classified as relevant?
Since our goal is to analyze the relationship be-
tween Chinese word segmentation, and IR, we
use weak relevant judgements. It is more related
to score functions to distinguish weak relevance
from strong relevance, that is, whether the query
is the topic of the document. This means the above
document is judged as relevant for the query ?Bei-
jing airport.?
In summary, our own test collection has about
200 queries, and at least 100 judged documents
per query with the TREC corpus as our base cor-
pus3.
6 Experiments
We conducted a series of experiments in word-
based Chinese information retrieval, with the aim
of establishing which segmenter is best for CIR,
while pursuing the best segmentation performance
in terms of segmented corpus is not the main crux.
In this section, we first present the accuracy of dif-
ferent segmentation methods, and then discuss the
results of IR systems.
6.1 Chinese Word Segmentation
ICTCLAS is a Chinese segmentation tool built by
the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese
Academy of Sciences. Its segmentation model is a

class-based hidden Markov model (HMM) model
(Zhang et al, 2003). The segmenter is trained
from manually segmented corpus, which makes
it ignore both the tightness of units and unknown
words such as ??CF? (Pinatubo), which are
difficult to identify.
In this experiment, we segmented the Chinese
Treebank using ICTCLAS and our three methods
that employ the tightness measure. The evalua-
tion is based on the manual segmentation of the
corpus. We evaluated the methods on the entire
Treebank corpus, employing 10-cross validation
for result significance verification.
In order to measure the tightness of Chinese
semantic units, pattern distributions of every 4-
gram were extracted from the Chinese Gigaword
corpus. Tight Combine is the ICTCLAS refined
segmentation that employs the non-compositional
compound list from the Chinese Gigaword cor-
pus. The threshold for non-compositional com-
pound ?1 is set to 11. Tight Split is the refined
segmentation of Tight Combine using Equation 2.
Online Tight is the segmentation using Equation
2 directly. For Tight Split and Online Tight, we
employed a lexicon which contains 41,245 words,
and set the thresholds ?2, ?3, and ?4 to 11, 0.01,
and 0.01, respectively. The parameters ?1 and ?2
are set according to the observation that the per-
centage of non-compositional units is high when
the tightness is greater than 11 for all the 4-grams
in the Chinese Gigaword corpus. The other two
parameters were established after experimenting
with several parameter pairs, such as (1,1), (0.1,
0.1), and (0.1, 0.01). We chose the one with the
best segmentation accuracy according to the stan-
dard corpus.
Table 1 shows the mean accuracy result over the
10 folders. The accuracy is the ratio of the number
of correctly segmented intervals to the number of
all intervals. The result shows that our method
improves over the ICTCLAS segmentation result,
but the improvement is not statistically significant
(measured by t-test). The only significant result is
that Online tight is worse than other methods.
Surprisingly, there is a large gap between
Tight Split and Online Tight, although they em-
ploy the same parameters. It turns out the ma-
jor difference lies in the segmentation of function

words. Since it is based on ICTCLAS, Tight Split
does a good job in segmenting function words
such as verbal particles which represent past tense
??? and the nominalizer ?{.? Online Tight
tends to combine these words with the consecu-
tive one. For example, considering ????? (cu-
mulated), the Treebank and Tight Split segment it
into ???|?? (cumulate + particle); while On-
line Tight leaves it unsegmented.
6.2 IR Experiment Setup
We conducted our information retrieval experi-
ments using the Lucene package (Hatcher and
Gospodnetic, 2004). The documents and queries
were segmented by our three approaches before
indexing and searching process. In order to ana-
lyze the performance of our segmentation meth-
ods with different retrieval systems, we employed
two score functions: the BM25 function (Peng et
al., 2002b) 4; and BM25Beta (Function 4), which
prefers documents with more query terms.
Score(Q,D) ={
T
(1+?)?N
?T
i=0 score(ti, D) if T < N?N
i=0 score(ti, D) if T = N
(4)
In the above equation, score(ti, D) is the score
of the term ti in the document D. Although
we used BM25 as our base score function for
score(ti, D), it can be replaced by other score
functions, such as tf*idf, or a probability language
model. ? is a parameter to control a penalty com-
ponent for those documents that do not contain
all the query terms; T is the number of distinc-
tive query terms in the document; and N is the
number of query terms. The function penalizes
documents that do not contain all the query terms,

6.3 IR Experiment Results
Table 2 shows the comparison of our two seg-
menters to ICTCLAS on the IR task. The per-
formance of IR systems was measured by mean
average precision (MAP) of the query set. The re-
sults show that Tight Combine is better than the
ICTCLAS segmentation, especially when using
BM25. The relationship between Tight Split and
ICTCLAS is not clear.
In order to give a more in-depth analysis of
the word segmentation methods with respect to
the targeted phenomenon of semantic units, we
classified the 200 queries into three categories ac-
cording to their tightness as measured by func-
tion 1. The three classes are queries with tight-
ness in ranges [+?, 10), [10, 1), and [1, 0),
which contain 54, 41, and 108 queries respec-
tively. Queries in the range [+?, 10) are tight
queries, such as ?v?
