Abstract 
 
This paper deals with the relationship between weblog content and time. With the proposed temporal mutual information, we analyze 
the collocations in time dimension, and the interesting collocations related to special events. The temporal mutual information is 
employed to observe the strength of term-to-term associations over time. An event detection algorithm identifies the collocations that 
may cause an event in a specific timestamp. An event summarization algorithm retrieves a set of collocations which describe an event. 
We compare our approach with the approach without considering the time interval. The experimental results demonstrate that the 
temporal collocations capture the real world semantics and real world events over time.

Introduction 
Compared with traditional media such as online news 
and enterprise websites, weblogs have several unique 
characteristics, e.g., containing abundant life experiences 
and public opinions toward different topics, highly 
sensitive to the events occurring in the real world, and 
associated with the personal information of bloggers. 
Some works have been proposed to leverage these 
characteristics, e.g., the study of the relationship between 
the content and bloggers? profiles (Adamic & Glance, 
2005; Burger & Henderson, 2006; Teng & Chen, 2006), 
and content and real events (Glance, Hurst & Tornkiyo, 
2004; Kim, 2005; Thelwall, 2006; Thompson, 2003). 
In this paper, we will use temporal collocation to 
model the term-to-term association over time.  In the past, 
some useful collocation models (Manning & Sch?tze, 
1999) have been proposed such as mean and variance, 
hypothesis test, mutual information, etc. Some works 
analyze the weblogs from the aspect of time like the 
dynamics of weblogs in time and location (Mei, et al, 
2006), the weblog posting behavior (Doran, Griffith & 
Henderson, 2006; Hurst, 2006), the topic extraction (Oka, 
Abe & Kato, 2006), etc. The impacts of events on social 
media are also discussed, e.g., the change of weblogs after 
London attack (Thelwall, 2006), the relationship between 
the warblog and weblogs (Kim, 2005; Thompson, 2003), 
etc. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines 
temporal collocation to model the strength of term-to-term 
associations over time.  Section 3 introduces an event 
detection algorithm to detect the events in weblogs, and 
an event summarization algorithm to extract the 
description of an event in a specific time with temporal 
collocations. Section 4 shows and discusses the 
experimental results.  Section 5 concludes the remarks. 
Temporal Collocations 
We derive the temporal collocations from Shannon?s 
mutual information (Manning & Sch?tze, 1999) which is 
defined as follows (Definition 1). 
Definition 1 (Mutual Information) The mutual 
information of two terms x and y is defined as: 
)()(
),(log),(),(
yPxP
yxPyxPyxI =  
where P(x,y) is the co-occurrence probability of x and y, 
and P(x) and P(y) denote the occurrence probability of x 
and y, respectively. 
Following the definition of mutual information, we 
derive the temporal mutual information modeling the 
term-to-term association over time, and the definition is 
given as follows.  
 Definition 2 (Temporal Mutual Information) Given 
a timestamp t and a pair of terms x and y, the temporal 
mutual information of x and y in t is defined as: 
)|()|(
)|,(log)|,()|,(
tyPtxP
tyxPtyxPtyxI =
where P(x,y|t) is the probability of co-occurrence of terms 
x and y in timestamp t, P(x|t) and P(y|t) denote the 
probability of occurrences of x and y in timestamp t, 
respectively. 
To measure the change of mutual information in time 
dimension, we define the change of temporal mutual 
information as follows. 
Definition 3 (Change of Temporal Mutual 
Information) Given time interval [t1, t2], the change of 
temporal mutual information is defined as: 
12
12
21
)|,()|,(),,,(
tt
tyxItyxIttyxC ?
?=  
where C(x,y,t1,t2) is the change of temporal mutual 
information of terms x and y in time interval [t1, t2], I(x,y| 
t1) and I(x,y| t2) are the temporal mutual information in 
time t1 and t2, respectively. 
3. Event Detection 
Event detection aims to identify the collocations 
resulting in events and then retrieve the description of 
events. Figure 1 sketches an example of event detection. 
The weblog is parsed into a set of collocations. All 
collocations are processed and monitored to identify the 
plausible events.  Here, a regular event ?Mother?s day? 
and an irregular event ?Typhoon Chanchu? are detected.  
The event ?Typhoon Chanchu? is described by the words  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: An Example of Event Detection
?Typhoon?, ?Chanchu?, ?2k?, ?Eye?, ?Path? and 
?chinaphillippine?.  
The architecture of an event detection system includes 
a preprocessing phase for parsing the weblogs and 
retrieving the collocations; an event detection phase 
detecting the unusual peak of the change of temporal 
mutual information and identifying the set of collocations 
which may result in an event in a specific time duration; 
and an event summarization phase extracting the 
collocations related to the seed collocations found in a 
specific time duration. 
The most important part in the preprocessing phase is 
collocation extraction. We retrieve the collocations from 
the sentences in blog posts. The candidates are two terms 
within a window size. Due to the size of candidates, we 
have to identify the set of tracking terms for further 
analysis. In this paper, those candidates containing 
stopwords or with low change of temporal mutual 
information are removed. 
In the event detection phase, we detect events by 
using the peak of temporal mutual information in time 
dimension.  However, the regular pattern of temporal 
mutual information may cause problems to our detection. 
Therefore, we remove the regular pattern by seasonal 
index, and then detect the plausible events by measuring 
the unusual peak of temporal mutual information. 
If a topic is suddenly discussed, the relationship 
between the related terms will become higher. Two 
alternatives including change of temporal mutual 
information and relative change of temporal mutual 
information are employed to detect unusual events. Given 
timestamps t1 and t2 with temporal mutual information 
MI1 and MI2, the change of temporal mutual information 
is calculated by (MI2-MI1). The relative change of 
temporal mutual information is calculated by (MI2-
MI1)/MI1. 
For each plausible event, there is a seed collocation, 
e.g., ?Typhoon Chanchu?. In the event description 
retrieval phase, we try to select the collocations with the 
highest mutual information with the word w in a seed 
collocation. They will form a collocation network for the 
event.  Initially, the seed collocation is placed into the 
network.  When a new collocation is added, we compute 
the mutual information of the multiword collocations by 
the following formula, where n is the number of 
collocations in the network up to now. 
?= n iMInInformatioMutualMultiwo  
If the multiword mutual information is lower than a 
threshold, the algorithm stops and returns the words in the 
collocation network as a description of the event.  Figure 
2 sketches an example.  The collocations ?Chanchu?s 
path?, ?Typhoon eye?, and ?Chanchu affects? are added 
into the network in sequence based on their MI. 
We have two alternatives to add the collocations to 
the event description. The first method adds the 
collocations which have the highest mutual information 
as discussed above. In contrast, the second method adds 
the collocations which have the highest product of mutual 
information and change of temporal mutual information.

Experiments and Discussions 
Temporal Mutual Information versus 
Mutual Information 
In the experiments, we adopt the ICWSM weblog data 
set (Teng & Chen, 2007; ICWSM, 2007). This data set 
collected from May 1, 2006 through May 20, 2006 is 
about 20 GB. Without loss of generality, we use the 
English weblog of 2,734,518 articles for analysis. 
To evaluate the effectiveness of time information, we 
made the experiments based on mutual information 
(Definition 1) and temporal mutual information 
(Definition 2). The former called the incremental 
approach measures the mutual information at each time 
point based on all available temporal information at that 
time. The latter called the interval-based approach 
considers the temporal mutual information in different 
time stamps.  Figures 3 and 4 show the comparisons 
between interval-based approach and incremental 
approach, respectively, in the event of Da Vinci Code.   
We find that ?Tom Hanks? has higher change of 
temporal mutual information compared to ?Da Vinci 
Code?. Compared to the incremental approach in Figure 4, 
the interval-based approach can reflect the exact release 
date of ?Da Vinci Code.?

=i 1 4.2. Evaluation of Event Detection 
We consider the events of May 2006 listed in 
wikipedia1 as gold standard. On the one hand, the events 
posted in wikipedia are not always complete, so that we 
adopt recall rate as our evaluation metric.  On the other 
hand, the events specified in wikipedia are not always 
discussed in weblogs.  Thus, we search the contents of 
blog post to verify if the events were touched on in our 
blog corpus. Before evaluation, we remove the events 
listed in wikipedia, but not referenced in the weblogs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3: Interval-based Approach in Da Vinci Code  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4: Incremental Approach in Da Vinci Code 
gure 5 sketches the idea of evaluation.  The left side 
of t s figure shows the collocations detected by our event 
dete tion system, and the right side shows the events 
liste  in wikipedia.  After matching these two lists, we 
can find that the first three listed events were correctly 
identified by our system.  Only the event ?Nepal Civil 
War? was listed, but not found. Thus, the recall rate is 
75% in this case. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5: Evaluation of Event Detection Phase 
As discussed in Section 3, we adopt change of 
temporal mutual information, and relative change of 
temporal mutual information to detect the peak. In Figure 
6, we compare the two methods to detect the events in 
weblogs. The relative change of temporal mutual 
information achieves better performance than the change 
of temporal mutual information. 
                                                     
1 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_2006 
Table 1 and Table 2 list the top 20 collocations based 
on these two approaches, respectively. The results of the 
first approach show that some collocations are related to 
the feelings such as ?fell left? and time such as ?Saturday 
night?. In contrast, the results of the second approach 
show more interesting collocations related to the news 
events at that time, such as terrorists ?zacarias 
moussaoui? and ?paramod mahajan.? These two persons 
were killed in May 3. Besides, ?Geena Davis? got the 
golden award in May 3. That explains why the 
collocations detected by relative change of temporal 
mutual information are better than those detected by 
change of temporal mutual information.

of mutual information 
4.3. Evaluation of Event Summarization 
As discussed in Section 3, we have two methods to 
include collocations to the event description. Method 1 
employs the highest mutual information, and Method 2 
utilizes the highest product of mutual information and 
change of temporal mutual information. Figure 7 shows 
the performance of Method 1 and Method 2. We can see 
that the performance of Method 2 is better than that of 
Method 1 in most cases. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7: Overall Performance of Event Summarization 
The results of event summarization by Method 2 are 
shown in Figure 8. Typhoon Chanchu appeared in the 
Pacific Ocean on May 10, 2006, passed through 
Philippine and China and resulted in disasters in these 
areas on May 13 and 18, 2006.  The appearance of the 
typhoon Chanchu cannot be found from the events listed 
in wikipedia on May 10.  However, we can identify the 
appearance of typhoon Chanchu from the description of 
the typhoon appearance such as ?typhoon named? and 
?Typhoon eye.  In addition, the typhoon Chanchu?s path 
can also be inferred from the retrieved collocations such 
as ?Philippine China? and ?near China?. The response of 
bloggers such as ?unexpected typhoon? and ?8 typhoons? 
is also extracted.

5. Concluding Remarks 
This paper introduces temporal mutual information to 
capture term-term association over time in weblogs. The 
extracted collocation with unusual peak which is in terms 
of relative change of temporal mutual information is 
selected to represent an event.  We collect those 
collocations with the highest product of mutual 
information and change of temporal mutual information 
to summarize the specific event.  The experiments on 
ICWSM weblog data set and evaluation with wikipedia 
event lists at the same period as weblogs demonstrate the 
feasibility of the proposed temporal collocation model 
and event detection algorithms. 
Currently, we do not consider user groups and 
locations. This methodology will be extended to model 
the collocations over time and location, and the 
relationship between the user-preferred usage of 
collocations and the profile of users.
