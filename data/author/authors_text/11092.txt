Abstract. We propose a method of acquiring attribute words for a wide
range of objects from Japanese Web documents. The method is a simple
unsupervised method that utilizes the statistics of words, lexico-syntactic
patterns, and HTML tags. To evaluate the attribute words, we also es-
tablish criteria and a procedure based on question-answerability about
the candidate word.
1 Introduction
Knowledge about how we recognize objects is of great practical importance for
many NLP tasks. Knowledge about attributes, which tells us from what view-
points objects are usually understood or described, is one of such type of knowl-
edge. For example, the attributes of car objects will be weight, engine, steering
wheel, driving feel, and manufacturer. In other words, attributes are items whose
values we want to know when we want to know about the object. More analyti-
cally, we tend to regard A as an attribute for objects of class C when A works
as if function v = A(o), o ? C where v is necessary to us to identify o (especially
to distinguish o from o?(= o) ? C). Therefore, obvious applications of attributes
are ones such as summarization [1,2] and question-answering [3]. Moreover, they
can be useful as features in word clustering [4] or machine learning. Although
the knowledge base for attributes can be prepared manually (e.g., WordNet [5]),
problems are cost and coverage. To overcome these, we propose a method that
automatically acquires attribute knowledge from the Web.
To acquire the attributes for a given class, C (e.g., car), the proposed method
first downloads documents that contain class label C (e.g., ?car?) from the Web.1
We extract the candidates of attribute words from these documents and score
them according to the statistics of words, lexico-syntactic patterns, and HTML
tags. Highly scored words are output as attributes for the class. Lexico-syntactic
patterns and other statistics have been used in other lexical knowledge acquisi-
tion systems [3,4,6,7,8]. We specifically used lexico-syntactic patterns involving
the Japanese postposition ?no? as used in [8] such as ?C no A? where A is an
attribute word, which is almost equivalent to pattern ?A of C? used in [7] to
1 We use C to denote both the class and its class label (the word representing the
class). We also use A to denote both the attribute and the word representing it.

find part-whole relations. Novel features of our method are its use of Web search
engines to focus on documents highly relevant to the class and its use of statistics
concerning attribute words and surrounding HTML tags.
One of the difficulties in studying attribute knowledge is that there are no
standard definitions of attributes, or criteria for evaluating obtained attributes.
In this paper, we propose a simple but effective definition of attributes that
matches our motivation and applications, i.e., whether we can ask a question
about the attribute and whether there is an answer to that question (question
answerability). For example, one can ask as ?Who is the manufacturer of this
car??, and someone might answer ?Honda?, because we want to know the manu-
facturer when we concerned about cars. We designed a procedure for evaluating
attributes based on this idea. As the literature points out [9,10], attributes can
include many types of relations such as property (e.g., weight), part-of (e.g.,
engine), telic (e.g., driving feel), and agentive (e.g., manufacturer). However, we
ignored type distinctions in this study. First, because attributes are useful even
if the type is not known, and second, because defining attributes as one of these
types and evaluating them only complicates the evaluation process, making the
results unstable. The use of linguistic tests to define attributes is not that new.
Woods [11] devised a test on whether we can say ?The A of o is v.? Although we
followed this procedure, we focused more on attributes that are important for
our understanding of an object by using question-answerability as our criterion.
2 Acquisition Method
2.1 Basic Observations on Attributes
Our method is based on the following three observations.
1. Attributes tend to occur in documents that contain the class label and not
in other documents.
2. Attributes tend to be emphasized by the use of certain HTML tags or occur
as items in HTML itemizations or tables in Web documents.
3. Attributes tend to co-occur with the class label in specific lexico-syntactic
patterns involving the postposition ?no.?
2.2 Extraction of Candidate Words
To acquire the attributes of class C, we first download documents that contain
class label C using a Web search engine, according to the first observation. We
refer to this set of documents as a local document set (LD(C)). All the nouns
appearing in the local document set are regarded as candidates of attribute
words. Here, the nouns are words tagged as ?proper nouns?, ?sahen nouns?
(nouns that can become a verb with the suffix ?suru?), ?location?, or ?unknown?
(e.g., words written in katakana) by a Japanese morphological analyzer, JUMAN
[12]. Note that we restricted ourselves to single word attributes in this study.
The obtained candidate words are scored in the next step.

glish translations for the patterns in parenthesis).

C no A ga (A of C [verb]) C no A made (even/until A of C) C no AA(A of C,)
C no A wo ([verb] A of C) C no A kara (from A of C)
C no A ni (at/in A of C) C no A yori (from/than A of C)
2.3 Ranking of Candidate Words
We rank the candidate words according to a score that reflects the observations
described in Sect. 2.1. The overall score takes the following form.
V (C, A) = n(C, A) ? f(C, A) ? t(C, A) ? dfidf(C, A), (1)
where A is the candidate word to be scored and C is the class. n(C, A) and
f(C, A) are scores concerning lexico-syntactic patterns. t(C, A) is a score con-
cerning the statistics of HTML tags to reflect the second observation. Finally,
dfidf(C, A) is the score related to word statistics. This reflects the first obser-
vation. By multiplying these sub-scores, we expect that they will complement
each other. We will explain the details on these sub-scores in the following.
As previously mentioned, we use lexico-syntactic patterns including the Japa-
nese postposition ?no? as clues. The patterns take the form ?C no A POST ?
where POST is a Japanese postposition or a punctuation mark.2 The actual
patterns used are listed in Table 1. Score n(C, A) is the number of times C and
A co-occur in these patterns in the local document set LD(C).
Score f(C, A) requires more explanation. Roughly, f(C, A) is the number of
times C and A co-occur in the patterns without the last postposition (i.e., pat-
tern ?C no A?) collected from 33 years of parsed newspaper articles.3 Note that
pattern matching was done against the parsed dependency structures.4 The rea-
son this score was used in addition to n(C, A) was to obtain more reliable scores
by increasing the number of documents to be matched. This may sound contra-
dictory to the fact that the Web is the largest corpus in the world. However,
we found that we could not obtain all the documents that contained the class
label because existing commercial Web search engines return URLs for a very
small fraction of matched documents (usually up to about 1,000 documents).
Although we could use hit counts for the patterns, we did not do this to avoid
overloading the search engine (each class has about 20,000 candidate words).
Score t(C, A) is the number of times A appears in LD(C) surrounded by
HTML tags. More precisely, we count the number of times A appears in the
form: ?<tag1>A<tag2>? where the number of characters between HTML tags

for easier understanding.

per 1983?1990; 3.01 GB in total. We used a Japanese dependency parser [13].
4 The differences from n(C, A) were introduced to reuse the existing parsed corpus.

Fig. 1. Example HTML document
(i.e., the length of A) is 20 at maximum. The tags (<tag1> and <tag2>) can be
either a start tag (e.g., <A>) or an end tag (e.g., </A>). This score is intended
to give high values for words that are emphasized or occur in itemizations or
tables. For example, in the HTML document in Fig. 1, the words ??????
?? (Thai-curry)?, ??? (ingredient)?, ????? (spice)?, ?????????
?? (coriander, cumin)?, and ???? (recipe)? are counted.
Finally, dfidf(C, A), which reflects the first observation, is calculated as:
dfidf(C, A) = df(A, LD(C)) ? idf(A), idf(A) = log |G|df(A,G) .
df(A, X) denotes the number of documents where A appears in documents X .
G is a large set of randomly collected Web documents, which we call the global
document set. We derived this score from a similar score, which was used in [14]
to measure the association between a hypernym and hyponyms.
3 Evaluation Criteria
This section presents the evaluation criteria based on question-answerability (QA
tests). Based on the criteria, we designed an evaluation procedure where the
evaluators were asked to answer either by yes or no to four tests at maximum,
i.e., a hyponymy test (Sect. 3.4), a QA test (Sect. 3.1) and a suffix augmented
QA test (Sect. 3.2) followed by a generality test (Sect. 3.3).
3.1 Question-Answerability Test
By definitions we used, attributes are what we want to know about the object.
Therefore, if A is an attribute of objects of class C, we can arrange questions
(consisting of A and C) that require the values for A as the answer. Then someone
should be able to answer the questions. For example, we can ask ?Who is the
director of this movie?? because director is an attribute of movie. The answer
might be someone such as ?Stanley Kubrick.? We designed the QA test shown in
Fig. 2 to assess the correctness of attribute A for class C based on this criterion.
Several points should be noted. First, since the value for the attribute is actually
defined for the object instance (i.e., v = A(o), o ? C), we should qualify class
label C using ?kono (this)? to refer to an object instance of class C.
Second, since we cannot know what question is possible for A beforehand,
we generate all the question types listed in Fig. 2 and ask whether any of them
are acceptable.
110 K. Tokunaga, J. Kazama, and K. Torisawa
Are any of the following questions grammatically correct, natural, and answerable?
1. ?? C ? A??? (kono C no A ha nani?/What is the A of this C?)
2. ?? C ? A??? (kono C no A ha dare?/Who is the A of this C?)
3. ?? C ? A???? (kono C no A ha itu?/When is the A of this C?)
4. ?? C ? A???? (kono C no A ha doko?/Where is the A of this C?)
5. ?? C ? A???? (kono C no A ha dore?/Which is the A of this C?)
6. ?? C ? A????? (kono C no A ha ikutu?/How many is the A of this C?)
7. ?? C ? A???? (kono C no A ha dou?/How much is the A of this C?)
Fig. 2. Question-answerability Test
Third, the question should be natural as well as grammatically correct. Nat-
uralness was explained to the evaluators as positively determining whether the
question can be their first choice in usual conversations. In our point of view, at-
tributes should be important items for people in describing objects. We assumed
that attributes that conformed to the naturalness criterion would be such impor-
tant attributes. For example, stapler is not an attribute of company in our sense,
although almost all companies own staplers. Our naturalness criterion can re-
flect this observation since the question ?What is the stapler of this company??
is unnatural as a first question when talking about a company, and therefore
we can successfully conclude that stapler is not an attribute. Note that Woods?
linguistic test [11] (i.e., whether ?the attribute of an object is a value? can be
stated or not) cannot reject stapler since it does not have the naturalness re-
quirement (e.g., we can say ?the stapler of [used by] SONY is Stapler-X?).5 In
addition, note that such importances can be assessed more easily in the QA test,
since questioners basically ask what they think is important at least at the time
of utterance. However, we cannot expect such an implication even though the
declarative sentence is acceptable.
Finally, the answer to the question does not necessarily need to be written in
language. For example, values for attributes such as map, picture, and blueprint
cannot be written as language expressions but can be represented by other media.
Such attributes are not rare since we obtain attributes from the Web.
3.2 Suffix Augmented QA Test
Some attributes that are obtained can fail the QA test even if they are correct,
especially when the surface form is different from the one they actually mean.
This often occurs since Japanese is very elliptic and our method is restricted to
single word attributes. For example, the word seito (students) can be used to
represent the attribute seito suu (number of students) as in the sentence below.
kono gakko no seito ha 500 nin
this school of students is 500 NUM
(The number of students of this school is 500.)
5 Stapler might be an important attribute of companies for stationery sellers. However,
we focus on attributes that are important for most people in most situations.

? ? (number of)??? (method for) ? (name of)?? (-er)
? ??? ([amount of] time of) ?? (time of)???? (period of) ?? (location of)
? ?? (amount of money for) ?? (degree of)??? (state of)
? ??? (nominalized adjectives e.g., ?height of? ?prettiness of?)
Fig. 3. Allowed augmentation
These attributes whose parts are elided (e.g., seito representing seito suu) are
also useful since they are actually used in sentences as in the above example.
Therefore, they should be assessed as correct attributes in some way. Although
the most appropriate question for seito representing seito suu is (6) in Fig. 2,
it is unfortunately ungrammatical since ikutu cannot be used for the number of
persons. Therefore, seito representing seito suu will fail the QA test.6
In Japanese, most of the elided parts can be restored by adding appropriate
suffixes (as ?suu? (number of) in the previous example) or by adding ?no? +
nominalized adjectives. Thus, when the attribute word failed the first QA test,
we asked the evaluators to re-do the QA test by choosing an appropriate suffix
or a nominalized adjective from the list of allowed augmentations and adding it
to the end of the evaluated word. Figure 3 lists the allowed augmentations.7,8
3.3 Generality Test
Although our primal aim was to acquire the attributes for a given class, i.e., ,
to find attributes that are common to all the instances of the class, we found,
in preliminary experiments, that some uncommon (but interesting) attributes
were assessed as correct according to the QA test depending on the evaluator.
An example is subtitle for the class movie. Strictly speaking, subtitle is not
an attribute of all movies, since all movies do not necessarily have subtitles.
For example, only foreign films have subtitles in Japan. However, we think this
attribute is also useful in practice for people who have a keen interest in foreign
films. Thus, the evaluators were asked whether the attribute was common for
most instances of the class when the attribute was judged to be correct in the
QA test. We call attributes that passed this generality test general attributes,
and those that failed but passed the QA test relaxed attributes (note that general
attributes is a subset of relaxed attributes). We compare the accuracies for the
relaxed and general attributes in the experiments.
6 Seito (representing students) might pass the QA test with question type (2) in Fig.
2. However, this is not always the case since some evaluators will judge the question
to be unnatural.
7 Postposition ?no (of)? before the suffix is also allowed to be added if it makes the
question more natural.
8 The problem here might not occur if we used many more question types in the first
QA test. However, we did not do this to keep the first QA test simple. With the same
motivation, we kept the list of allowed suffixes short (only general and important
suffixes). The uncovered cases were treated by adding nominalized adjectives.

3.4 Hyponymy Test
Finally, we should note that we designed the evaluation procedure so that the
evaluators could be asked whether candidate A is a hyponym of C before the QA
tests. If A is a hyponym of C, we can skip all subsequent tests since A cannot
be an attribute of C. We added this test because the output of the system often
contains hyponyms and these tend to cause confusion in the QA tests since
expression ?C no A? is natural even when A is a hyponym of C (e.g., ?anime no
Dragon Ball (Dragon Ball [of/the] anime)?).
4 Experiments
4.1 Experimental Setting
We first selected 32 word classes from 1,589 classes acquired from the Web with
an automatic hypernym-hyponym acquisition method [14]. Here, we regarded the
hypernym as the class label. Since our purpose was just to evaluate our method
for classes from the Web, we selected classes that were obtained successfully. We
randomly chose the 22 classes listed in Table 2 for human evaluation from these
32 classes.9 The hyponyms were used to help the evaluators to disambiguate the
meaning of class labels (if ambiguity existed).
To collect LD(C), we used the Web search engine goo (http://www.goo.ne.jp).
The size of LD(C) was 857 documents (URLs) on class average. There were
about 20, 000 candidate words on class average. As global document set G re-
quired for the calculation of dfidf(C, A), we used 1.0?106 randomly downloaded
Web documents.
Table 2. Classes used in evaluation
?? (city), ??? (museum), ?? (national holiday), ?? (police), ?? (facility), ?? (university),
?? (newspaper), ?? (garbage), ?? (shrine), ? (bird), ?? (hospital), ?? (plant), ? (river), ?
?? (elementary school), ? (music tune), ??? (library), ?? (branch office), ??? (web site), ?
(town), ???? (sensor), ?? (training), ??? (car)
We output the top 50 attributes for each class ranked with our proposed
method and with alternative methods that were used for comparison. We gath-
ered outputs for all the methods, removing duplication (i.e., taking the set union)
to achieve efficient evaluation, and re-sorted them randomly to ensure that the
assessment was unbiased. Four human evaluators assessed these gathered at-
tributes class-by-class in four days using a GUI tool implementing the evaluation
procedure described in Sect. 3. There were a total of 3, 678 evaluated attributes.
Using the evaluation results, we re-constructed the evaluations for the top 50 for
each method. The kappa value [15], which indicates inter-evaluator agreement,
was 0.533 for the general attribute case and 0.593 for the relaxed attribute case.
According to [15], these kappa values indicate ?moderate? agreement.
9 This selection was due to time/cost limitations.

4.2 Accuracy of Proposed Method
Figure 4 has accuracy graphs for the proposed method for relaxed attributes.
The graph on the left shows per-evaluator precision when the top n (repre-
sented by x axis) attributes were output. The precision is the average over all
classes. Although we cannot calculate the actual recall, the x axis corresponds
to approximate recall. We can see that ranking with the proposed method has
a positive correlation with human evaluation, although the assessments varied
greatly depending on the evaluator. The graph on the right shows curves for
average (with standard deviation), 3-consensus, and 4-consensus precision. 3-
consensus (4-consensus) is precision where the attribute is considered correct by
at least three (four) evaluators. Figure 5 has graphs for the general attribute
case the same as for the relaxed case. Although there is a positive correlation
between ranking with the proposed method and human evaluators, the precision
was, not surprisingly, lower than that for the relaxed case. In addition, the lower
kappa value (0.533 compared to 0.593 for the relaxed case) indicated that the
generality test was harder than the QA tests.
The accuracy of the proposed method was encouraging. Although we cannot
easily determine which indicator is appropriate, if we use the majority rule (3-

consensus in our case) employed in [7], the proposed method obtained relaxed
attributes with 0.852 precision and general attributes with 0.727 precision for the
top 20 outputs. Table 3 lists the top 20 attributes obtained with the proposed
method for several classes. The numeral before (after) ?/? is the number of
evaluators who judged the attribute as correct as a relaxed (general) attribute.
We can see that many interesting attributes were obtained.
4.3 Effect of Scores
In this analysis, we assessed the effect that sub-scores in Eq. (1) had on the
acquisition accuracy by observing the decrease in precision when we removed
each score from Eq. (1). First, we could observe a positive effect for most scores
in terms of the precision averaged over evaluators. Moreover, interestingly, the
tendency of the effect was very similar for all evaluators, even though the as-
sessments varied greatly depending on the evaluator as the previous experiment
showed. Due to space limitations, we will only present the latter analysis here.

We calculated the change in precision ?per evaluator?, and then calculated the
averaged change, i.e., the change averaged over evaluators. Figure 6 plots the
averaged change and standard deviations. The effect of n(C, A) is represented
by ?Proposed - pattern (web)?, that of f(C, A) by ?Proposed - pattern (news)?,
that of t(C, A) by ?Proposed - tag?, and that of dfidf(C, A) by ?Proposed -
dfidf?. In the relaxed attribute case, we can see that most of the scores were ef-
fective at almost all ranks regardless of the evaluator (negative difference means
positive effect). The effect of f(C, A) and t(C, A) was especially remarkable. Al-
though n(C, A) has a similar curve to f(C, A), the effect is weaker. This may
be caused by the difference in the number of documents available (As we previ-
ously described, we currently cannot obtain a large number of documents from
the Web). The effect dfidf(C, A) had was two-fold. This contributed positively
at lower ranks but it contributed negatively at higher ranks (around the top
1-5). In the general attribute case, the positive effect became harder to observe
although the tendency was similar to the relaxed case. However, we can see that
f(C, A) still contributed greatly even in this case. The effect of t(C, A), on the
other hand, seems to have weakened greatly.
4.4 Effect of Hypernym
If we have a hypernym-hyponym knowledge base, we can also collect the local
document set by using the hyponyms in the class as the keywords for the search
engine instead of using the class label (hypernym). In this experiment, we com-
pared the proposed method with this alternative. We collected about the same
number of documents for the alternative method as for the proposed method to
focus on the quality of collected documents. We used hyponyms with the alter-
native method instead of class label C in patterns for n(C, A) (thus n(Hs, A) to
be precise). f(C, A) was unchanged. Figure 7 plots the results in the same way
as for the previous analysis (i.e., difference from the proposed method). We can
see that the class label is better than hyponyms for collecting local documents
at least in the current setting.

5 Discussion
5.1 Related Work
Several studies have attempted to acquire attributes or attribute-value pairs
[1,3,7,8,16]. Yoshida [1] proposed a method of integrating tables on the Web.
Although his method consequently acquired attributes, he did not evaluate the
accuracy of attributes. Yoshida et al [16] proposed a method of identifying
attribute-value pairs in Web documents. However, since this method only iden-
tified the attributes obtained with the method in [1], the coverage might be
bounded by the coverage of tables for attributes. Moreover, these methods did
not utilize the statistics for words or lexico-syntactic patterns as ours did. Taka-
hashi et al [8] extracted triples (object, attribute, value) from newspaper articles
using lexico-syntactic patterns and statistical scores. However, they focused only
on proper nouns and selected the attribute candidates manually. Freishmann et
al. [3] extracted attribute-value pairs with a high degree of precision by filtering
the candidates extracted with lexico-syntactic patterns by using a model learned
with supervised learning. Although this approach is promising, their method was
limited to person names and we must prepare training data to apply the method
to other types of objects.
5.2 Future Directions
Clues based on QA tests. The current ranking, Eq. (1), does not exploit the
observation behind the criteria in Sect. 3. Only the lexico-syntactic patterns ?C
no A? slightly reflect the criteria. Higher accuracy might be achieved by using
patterns that directly reflect the QA tests, e.g., statistics from FAQ lists. The
hyponym tests in Sect. 3.4 can also be reflected if we use a hyponymy database.
In addition, it is not surprising that the proposed method was not efficient at
acquiring general attributes since the score was not meant for that (although
the use of class labels might be a contributing factor, ambiguous class labels

cause problems at the same time). The hyponym database might be exploited
to measure the generality of attributes.
Full use of the Web. The current method cannot use all Web documents
due to limitations with search engines. The more Web documents we have, the
more useful the score n(C, A). We are currently planning to prepare our own
non-restricted Web repository. Using this, we would also like to elaborate on the
comparison described in Sect. 4.4 between the use of hypernyms (class labels)
and hyponyms (instance words) in collecting the local document set.
Assessment of Coverage. Currently, the actual recall with the proposed
method is unknown. It will be important to estimate how many attributes are
needed for practical applications, e.g., by manually analyzing the use of pattern
?C no A? exhaustively for a certain class, C. In addition, since we selected classes
that were successfully obtained with a hyponymy acquisition method, we cannot
deny the possibility that the proposed method has been evaluated for the classes
for which reliable statistics can easily be obtained. Thus, the evaluation of more
difficult (e.g., more infrequent) classes will be an important future work.
Type Acquisition. What types of questions and what types of suffix augmen-
tations are possible for a given attribute (i.e., the type of attribute value) might
also be useful, e.g., in value extraction and in determining type of the attribute
(in the sense of ?property or part-of?). This was left for the evaluators to chose
arbitrarily in this study. We would like to extract such knowledge from the Web
using similar techniques such as word statistics and lexico-syntactic patterns.
6 Conclusion
We presented a method of acquiring attributes that utilizes statistics on words,
lexico-syntactic patterns, and HTML tags. We also proposed criteria and an
evaluation procedure based on question-answerability. Using the procedure, we
conducted experiments with four human evaluators. The results revealed that
our method could obtain attributes with a high degree of precision.
