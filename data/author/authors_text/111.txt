Abstract 
The aim of this paper is to investigate 
how much the effectiveness of a Ques-
tion Answering (QA) system was af-
fected by the performance of Machine 
Translation (MT) based question transla-
tion. Nearly 200 questions were selected 
from TREC QA tracks and ran through a 
question answering system. It was able to 
answer 42.6% of the questions correctly 
in a monolingual run. These questions 
were then translated manually from Eng-
lish into Arabic and back into English us-
ing an MT system, and then re-applied to 
the QA system. The system was able to 
answer 10.2% of the translated questions. 
An analysis of what sort of translation er-
ror affected which questions was con-
ducted, concluding that factoid type 
questions are less prone to translation er-
ror than others. 
1 Introduction 
Increased availability of on-line text in languages 
other than English and increased multi-national 
collaboration have motivated research in Cross-
Language Information Retrieval (CLIR). The 
goal of CLIR is to help searchers find relevant 
documents when their query terms are chosen 
from a language different from the language in 
which the documents are written. Multilinguality 
has been recognized as an important issue for the 
future of QA (Burger et al 2001). The multilin-
gual QA task was introduced for the first time in 
the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum CLEF-
2003. 
According to the Global Reach web site 
(2004), shown in Figure 1, it could be estimated 
that an English speaker has access to around 23 
times more digital documents than an Arabic 
speaker. One can conclude from the given infor-
mation shown in the Figure that cross-language 
is potentially very useful when the required in-
formation is not available in the users? language.

The goal of a QA system is to find answers to 
questions in a large collection of documents. The 
overall accuracy of a QA system is directly af-
fected by its ability to correctly analyze the ques-
tions it receives as input, a Cross Language 
Question Answering (CLQA) system will be 
sensitive to any errors introduced during question 
translation. Many researchers criticize the MT-
based CLIR approach. The reason for their criti-
cism mostly stem from the fact that the current 
translation quality of MT is poor, in addition MT 
system are expensive to develop and their appli-
cation degrades the retrieval efficiency due to the 
cost of the linguistic analysis.

This paper investigates the extent to which 
MT error affects QA accuracy. It is divided as 
follows: in section 2 relevant previous work on 
cross-language retrieval is described, section 3 
explains the experimental approach which in-
cludes the procedure and systems employed, it 
also discuss the results obtained, section 4 draws 
conclusions and future research on what im-
provements need to be done for MT systems. 
2 Related Research 
CLIR is an active area, extensive research on 
CLIR and the effects of MT on QA systems? re-
trieval effectiveness has been conducted. Lin and 
Mitamua (2004) point out that the quality of 
translation is fully dependent upon the MT sys-
tem employed. 
Perret (2004) proposed a question answering 
system designed to search French documents in 
response to French queries. He used automatic 
translation resources to translate the original que-
ries from (Dutch, German, Italian, Portuguese, 
Spanish, English and Bulgarian) and reports the 
performance level in the monolingual task was 
24.5% dropping to 17% in the bilingual task. A 
similar experiment was conducted by Plamondon 
and Foster (2003) on TREC questions and meas-
ured a drop of 44%, and in another experiment 
using Babelfish, the performance dropped even 
more, 53%. They believe that CLEF questions 
were easier to process because they did not in-
clude definition questions, which are harder to 
translate. Furthermore, Plamondon and Foster 
(2004) compare the cross language version of 
their Quantum QA system with the monolingual 
English version on CLEF questions and note the 
performance of a cross-language system (French 
questions and English documents) was 28% 
lower than the monolingual system using IBM1 
translation. 
Tanev et al (2004) note that DIOGENE sys-
tem, which relies on the Multi-WordNet, per-
forms 15% better in the monolingual (Italian-
Italian) than cross-language task (Italian-
English). In Magnini et al?s (2004) report for the 
year 2003, the average performance of correct 
answers on monolingual tasks was 41% and 25% 
in the bilingual tasks. In addition in the year 
2004, the average accuracy in the monolingual 
tasks was 23.7% and 14.7% in bilingual tasks. 
As elucidated above, much research has been 
conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of QA 
systems in a cross language platform by employ-
ing MT systems to translate the queries from the 
source language to the target language. How-
ever, most of them are focused on European lan-
guage pairs. To our knowledge, only one past 
example of research has investigated the per-
formance of a cross-language Arabic-English 
QA system Rosso et al(2005). The QA system 
used by Rosso et al(2005) is based on a system 
reported in Del Castillo (2004). Their experiment 
was carried out using the question corpus of the 
CLEF-2003 competition. They used questions in 
English and compared the answers with those 
obtained after the translation back into English 
from an Arabic question corpus which was 
manually translated. For the Arabic-English 
translation process, an automatic machine trans-
lator, the TARJIM Arabic-English machine 
translation system, was used. Rosso el al re-
ported a decrease of QA accuracy by more than 
30% which was caused by the translation proc-
ess. 
Work in the Rosso paper was limited to a sin-
gle QA and MT system and also did not analyze 
types of errors or how those errors affected dif-
ferent types of QA questions. Therefore, it was 
decided to conduct further research on MT sys-
tems and its affect on the performance in QA 
systems. This paper presents an extension on the 
previous mentioned study, but with more diverse 
ranges of TREC data set using different QA sys-
tem and different MT system. 
3 Experimental Approach 
To run this experiment, 199 questions were ran-
domly compiled from the TREC QA track, 
namely from TREC-8, TREC-9, TREC-11, 
TREC-2003 and TREC-2004, to be run through 
AnswerFinder, the results of which are discussed 
in section 3.1. The selected 199 English TREC 
questions were translated into Arabic by one of 
the authors (who is an Arabic speaker), and then 
fed into Systran to translate them into English. 
The analysis of translation is discussed in detail 
in section 3.2. 
3.1 Performance of AnswerFinder 
The 199 questions were run over AnswerFinder; 
divided as follows: 92 factoid questions, 51 defi-
nition questions and 56 list questions. The an-
swers were manually assessed following an as-
sessment scheme similar to the answer categories 
in iCLEF 2004: 
? Correct: if the answer string is valid and 
supported by the snippets 
EACL 2006 Workshop on Multilingual Question Answering - MLQA06
10
? Non-exact: if the answer string is miss-
ing some information, but the full answer 
is found in the snippets. 
? Wrong: if the answer string and the 
snippets are missing important informa-
tion or both the answer string and the 
snippets are wrong compared with the an-
swer key. 
? No answer: if the system does not return 
any answer at all. 
 
Table 1 provides an overall view, the system cor-
rectly answered 42.6% of these questions, 
whereas 25.8% wrongly, 23.9% no answer and 
8.1% non-exactly. Table 2 illustrates Answer-
Finder? abilities to answer each type of these 
questions separately.

Table 2. Detail analysis of AnswerFinder Per-
formance-monolingual run 
 
To measure the performance of Answer-
Finder, recall (ratio of relevant items retrieved to 
all relevant items in a collection) and precision 
(the ratio of relevant items retrieved to all re-
trieved items) were calculated. Thus, recall and 
precision and F-measure for AnswerFinder are, 
0.51 and 0.76, 0.6 respectively. 
3.2 Systran Translation 
Most of the errors noticed during the transla-
tion process were of the following types: wrong 
transliteration, wrong word sense, wrong word 
order, and wrong pronoun translations. Table 3 
lists Systran?s translation errors to provide cor-
rect transliteration 45.7%, wrong word senses 
(key word) 31%, wrong word order 25%, and 
wrong translation of pronoun 13.5%. 
Below is a discussion of Systran? translation 
accuracy and the problems that occurred during 
translation of the TREC QA track questions. 
 
Table 3. Types of Translation Errors 
 
Wrong Transliteration 
Wrong transliteration is the most common error 
that encountered during translation. Translitera-
tion is the process of replacing words in the 
source language with their phonetic equivalent in 
the target language. Al-Onaizan and Knight 
(2002) state that transliterating names from Ara-
bic into English is a non-trivial task due to the 
differences in their sound and writing system. 
Also, there is no one-to-one correspondence be-
tween Arabic sounds and English sounds. For 
example P and B are both mapped to the single 
Arabic letter ???; Arabic ??? and ?? ?are mapped 
into English H. 
Table 4. Incorrect use of translation when trans-
literation should have been used 
 
Table 5. Wrong translation of person?s name 
 
Transliteration mainly deals with proper 
names errors when MT doesn?t recognize them 
as a proper name and translates them instead of 
transliterating them. Systran produced 91 ques-
tions (45.7%) with wrong transliteration. It trans-
lated some names literally, especially those with 
a descriptive meaning. Table 4 provides an ex-
ample of such cases where ?Aga? was wrongly 
transliterated; and ?khan? was translated to ?be-
tray? where it should have been transliterated. 
This can also be seen in table 5; ?Hassan Ro-
hani? was translated literally as ?Spiritual good-
ness?.

Wrong Word Sense 
Wrong translation of words can occur when a 
single word can have different senses according 
to the context in which the word is used. Word 
sense problems are commoner in Arabic than in a 
language like English as Arabic vowels (written 
as diacritics) are largely unwritten in most texts. 
Systran translated 63 questions (31.2%) with 
at least one wrong word sense, 25% of them 
could have been resolved by adding diacritics. 
Table 6 illustrates an error resulting from 
Systran?s failure to translate words correctly 
even after diacritics have been added; the term 
????? ??????? (psychology) was wrongly translated 
as ?flag of breath?. The Arabic form is a com-
pound phrase; however Systran translated each 
word individually even after diacritics were 
added. 
 
Original text Who was the father of psy-
chology? 
Arabic ver-
sion 
??? ?? ???? ?????? 
Translation 
(wrong)  
From father flag of the 
breath? 
Table 6. Example of incorrect translation due to 
incorrect sense choice 
 
These errors can occur when a single word can 
have different senses according to the con-text in 
which the word is used. They also occur due to 
the diacritization in Arabic language. Arabic 
writing involves diacritization (vowel), which is 
largely ignored in modern texts. Ali (2003) gives 
a good example that can make an English 
speaker grasp the complexity caused by dropping 
Arabic diacritization. Suppose that vowels are 
dropped from an English word and the result is 
?sm?. The possibilities of the original word are: 
some, same, sum, and semi. 
Systran translated 63 questions out of 199 
(31.2%) with wrong word sense, 25% of them 
can be resolved by adding diacritization.  
Wrong Word Order 
Word order errors occurred when the translated 
words were in order that made no sense and this 
problem produced grammatically ill formed sen-
tences that the QA system was unable to process. 
Systran translated 25% of the questions with 
wrong word orders which lead to the construc-
tion of ungrammatical questions. Table 7 shows 
an example of wrong word order. 
 
Table 7. Wrong word order 
Wrong Pronoun 
Systran frequently translated the pronoun ???? to 
?air? in place of ?him? or ?it? as shown in table 
8. Table 9 shows an example pronoun problems; 
the pronoun ???? is translated into ?her?, instead 
of ?it?, which refers to ?building? in this case.

Arabic version ???  ??? ???? ?????  
Translation 
(wrong)  
From Collin Powell air? 
Table 8. Wrong translation of ?who? 
 
Table 9. wrong pro-drop of translation of ?it? 
 
It has been observed that Systran translation 
errors exhibited some clear regularities for cer-
tain questions as might be expected from a rule-
based system. As shown in tables 2,3,4,7 the 
term ?????? was translated to ?from? instead of 
?who?. This problem is related to the recognition 
of diacritization.

The evaluator observed that Systran? propen-
sity to produce some common wrong sense trans-
lations which lead to change the meaning of the 
questions, table 10 shows some of these common 
sense translation.

3.3 The Effectiveness of AnswerFinder 
combined with Systran? Translation 
After translating the 199 questions using Systran, 
they were passed to AnswerFinder. Figure 2 il-
lustrates the system?s abilities to answer the 
original and the translated questions; Answer-
Finder was initially able to answer 42.6% of the 
questions while after translation, its accuracy to 
return correct answers dropped to 10.2%. Its 
failure to return any answer increased by 35.5% 
(from 23.9% to 59.4%); in addition, non-exact 
answers decreased by 6.6% while wrong answers 
increased by 3.6% (from 25.4% to 28.9%).

Figure 2. Answering Original/Translated Ques-
tions (%) 
 
AnswerFinder was able to answer 23 trans-
lated questions out of 199. Out of these 23 ques-
tions, 12 were correctly translated and 11 exhib-
ited some translation errors. Looking closely at 
the 12 corrected translated question (shown in 
table 11), 9 of them are of the factoid type, one 
of definition type and two of the list type. And 
by investigating the other 11 questions that ex-
hibited some translation errors (shown in table 
12), it can be noticed that 9 of them are factoid 
and 2 are list types.  Our assumption for Systran? 
ability to translate factoid questions more than 
definition and list questions is that they exhibited 
less pronouns, in contrast to definition and list 
questions where many proper names were in-
cluded. 
In total, Systran has significantly reduced An-
swerFinder?s ability to return correct answers by 
32.4%. Table 13 shows recall, precision and F-
measure before and after translation, the value of 
recall before translation is 0.51 and after transla-
tion has dropped down to 0.12. Similarly, the 
precision value has gone down from 0.76 to 0.41, 
accordingly the F-measure also dropped down 
from 0.6 to 0.2. Altogether, in multilingual re-
trieval task precision and recall are 40.6% and 
30%, respectively, below the monolingual re-
trieval task.

4 Conclusions 
Systran was used to translate 199 TREC ques-
tions from Arabic into English. We have scruti-
nized the quality of Systran?s translation through 
out this paper. Several translation errors ap-
peared during translations which are of the type: 
wrong transliteration, wrong word sense, wrong 
word order and wrong pronoun. The translated 
questions were fed into AnswerFinder, which 
had a big impact on its accuracy in returning cor-
rect answers. AnswerFinder was seriously af-
fected by the relatively poor output of Systran; 
its effectiveness was degraded by 32.4%. This 
conclusion confirms Rosso et al(2005) findings 
using different QA system, different test sets and 
different machine translation system. Our results 
validate their results which they concluded that 
translation of the queries from Arabic into Eng-
lish has reduced the accuracy of QA system by 
more than 30%. 
We recommend using multiple MT to give a 
wider range of translation to choose from, hence, 
correct translation is more likely to appear in 
EACL 2006 Workshop on Multilingual Question Answering - MLQA06
13
multiple MT systems than in a single MT sys-
tem. However, it is essential to note that in some 
cases MT systems may all disagree with one an-
other in providing correct translation or they may 
agree on the wrong translation. 
It should also be borne in mind that some 
keywords are naturally more important than oth-
ers, so in a question-answering setting it is more 
important to translate them correctly. Some key-
words may not be as important, and some key-
words due to the incorrect analysis of the English 
question sentence by the Question Analysis 
module, may even degrade the translation and 
question-answering performance. 
We believe there are ways to avoid the MT er-
rors that discussed previously (i.e. wrong trans-
literation, wrong word senses, wrong word order, 
and wrong translation of pronoun). Below are 
some suggestions to overcome such problems: 
? One solution is to make some adjust-
ments (Pre or Post- processing) to the 
question translation process to minimize 
the effects of translation by automatically 
correcting some regular errors using a 
regular written expression. 
? Another possible solution is to try build-
ing an interactive MT system by providing 
users more than one translation to pick the 
most accurate one, we believe this will of-
fer a great help in resolving word sense 
problem. This is more suit-able for expert 
users of a language. 
In this paper, we have presented the errors as-
sociated with machine translation which indi-
cates that the current state of MT is not very reli-
able for cross language QA. Much work has been 
done in the area of machine translation for CLIR; 
however, the evaluation often focuses on re-
trieval effectiveness rather than translation cor-
rectness.
