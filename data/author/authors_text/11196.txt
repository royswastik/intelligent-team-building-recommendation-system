Abstract 
In this paper, we present a novel method 
based on CRFs in response to the two special 
characteristics of ?contextual dependency? 
and ?label redundancy? in sentence sentiment 
classification. We try to capture the contextual 
constraints on sentence sentiment using CRFs. 
Through introducing redundant labels into the 
original sentimental label set and organizing 
all labels into a hierarchy, our method can add 
redundant features into training for capturing 
the label redundancy.  The experimental 
results prove that our method outperforms the 
traditional methods like NB, SVM, MaxEnt 
and standard chain CRFs. In comparison with 
the cascaded model, our method can 
effectively alleviate the error propagation 
among different layers and obtain better 
performance in each layer. 
1 Introduction* 
There are a lot of subjective texts in the web, such 
as product reviews, movie reviews, news, 
editorials and blogs, etc. Extracting these 
subjective texts and analyzing their orientations 
play significant roles in many applications such as 
electronic commercial, etc. One of the most 
important tasks in this field is sentiment

classification, which can be performed in several 
levels: word level, sentence level, passage level, 
etc. This paper focuses on sentence level sentiment 
classification. 
Commonly, sentiment classification contains 
three layers of sub-tasks. From upper to lower, (1) 
Subjective/Objective classification: the subjective 
texts are extracted from the corpus teeming with 
both subjective and objective texts. (2) Polarity 
classification: a subjective text is classified into 
?positive? or ?negative? according to the 
sentimental expressions in the text. (3) Sentimental 
strength rating: a subjective text is classified into 
several grades which reflect the polarity degree of 
?positive? or ?negative?. It is a special multi-class 
classification problem, where the classes are 
ordered. In machine learning, this kind of problem 
is also regarded as an ordinal regression problem 
(Wei Wu et al 2005). In this paper, we mainly 
focus on this problem in sentiment classification. 
Sentiment classification in sentence level has its 
special characteristics compared with traditional 
text classification tasks. Firstly, the sentiment of 
each sentence in a discourse is not independent to 
each other. In other words, the sentiment of each 
sentence is related to those of other adjacent 
sentences in the same discourse. The sentiment of 
a sentence may vary in different contexts. If we 
detach a sentence from the context, its sentiment 
may not be inferred correctly. Secondly, there is 
redundancy among the sentiment classes, 
117
especially in sentimental strength classes. For 
example: 
?I love the scenario of ?No country for old man? 
very much!!? 
?This movie sounds good.? 
The first sentence is labeled as ?highly praised? 
class and the second one is labeled as ?something 
good? class. Both the sentences express positive 
sentiment for the movie, but the former expresses 
stronger emotion than the latter. We can see that 
both ?highly praised? and ?something good? 
belong to an implicit class ?positive?, which can be 
regarded as the relation between them.  If we add 
these implicit classes in the label set, the sentiment 
classes will form a hierarchical structure. For 
example, ?positive? can be regarded as the parent 
class of ?highly praised? and ?something good?, 
?subjective? can be regarded as the parent class of 
?positive? and ?negative?. This implicit 
hierarchical structure among labels should not be 
neglected because it may be beneficial for 
improving the accuracy of sentiment classification. 
In the paper, we call this characteristic of 
sentiment classification as ?label redundancy?. 
Unfortunately, in our knowledge most of the 
current research treats sentiment classification as a 
traditional multi-classification task or an ordinal 
regression task, which regard the sentimental 
classes being independent to each other and each 
sentence is also independent to the adjacent 
sentences in the context. In other words, they 
neglect the contextual information and the 
redundancy among sentiment classes. 
In order to consider the contextual information in 
the process of the sentence sentiment classification, 
some research defines contextual features and 
some uses special graph-based formulation, like 
(Bo Pang, et al 2005). In order to consider the 
label redundancy, one potential solution is to use a 
cascaded framework which can combine 
subjective/objective classification, polarity 
classification and sentimental strength 
classification together, where the classification 
results of the preceding step will be the input of the 
subsequent one. However, the subsequent 
classification cannot provide constraint and 
correction to the results of the preceding step, 
which will lead to the accumulation and 
propagation of the classification errors. As a result, 
the performance of sentiment analysis of sentences 
is often not satisfactory.  
This paper focuses on the above two special 
characteristics of the sentiment classification 
problem in the sentence level. To the first 
characteristic, we regard the sentiment 
classification as a sequence labeling problem and 
use conditional random field (CRFs) model to 
capture the relation between two adjacent 
sentences in the context. To the second 
characteristic, we propose a novel method based on 
a CRF model, in which the original task is mapped 
to a classification on a hierarchical structure, which 
is formed by the original label set and some 
additional implicit labels. In the hierarchical 
classification framework, the relations between the 
labels can be represented as the additional features 
in classification. Because these features are related 
to the original labels but unobserved, we name 
them as ?redundant features? in this paper. They 
can be used to capture the redundant and 
hierarchical relation between different sentiment 
classes. In this way, not only the performance of 
sentimental strength rating is improved, the 
accuracies of subjective/objective classification 
and polarity classification are also improved 
compared with the traditional sentiment 
classification method. And in comparison with the 
cascaded method, the proposed approach can 
effectively alleviate error propagation. The 
experimental results on movie reviews prove the 
validity of our method. 
2 Capturing Contextual Influence for 
Sentiment Classification 
For capturing the influence of the contexts to the 
sentiment of a sentence, we treat original sentiment 
classification as a sequence labeling problem. We 
regard the sentiments of all the sentences 
throughout a paragraph as a sequential flow of 
sentiments, and we model it using a conditional 
model. In this paper, we choose Conditional 
Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al 2001) 
because it has better performance than other 
sequence labeling tools in most NLP applications.  
CRFs are undirected graphical models used to 
calculate the conditional probability of a set of 
labels given a set of input variables. We cite the 
definitions of CRFs in (Lafferty et al 2001). It 
defines the conditional probability proportional to 
the product of potential functions on cliques of the 
graph, 
118
exp ( , )( | )
( )
F Y XP Y X
Z X?
? ?
=      (1) 
where X is a set of input random variables and Y is 
a set of random labels. ( , )F Y X is an arbitrary 
feature function over its arguments, ? is a learned 
weight for each feature function and  
( ) exp( ( , ))
y
XZ F Y X?= ?? . 
The training of CRFs is based on Maximum 
Likelihood Principle (Fei Sha et al 2003). The log 
likelihood function is 
[ ]( ) ( , ) log ( )k k kkL F Y X Z X?? ?= ? ??  
Therefore, Limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) 
algorithm is used to find this nonlinear 
optimization parameters.  
3 Label Redundancy in Sentiment 
Classification 
In this section, we explain the ?label redundancy? 
in sentiment classification mentioned in the first 
section. We will analyze the effect of the label 
redundancy on the performance of sentiment 
classification from the experimental view.  
We conduct the experiments of polarity 
classification and sentimental strength rating on the 
corpus which will be introduced in section 5 later. 
The class set is also illustrated in that section. 
Polarity classification is a three-class classification 
process, and sentimental strength rating is a five-
class classification process. We use first 200 
reviews as the training set which contains 6,079 
sentences, and other 49 reviews, totally 1,531 
sentences, are used as the testing set. Both the 
three-class classification and the five-class 
classification use standard CRFs model with the 
same feature set. The results are shown in Table 1, 
2 and 3, where ?Answer? denotes the results given 
by human, ?Results? denotes the results given by 
?CRFs model ?Correct? denotes the number of 
correct samples which is labeled by CRFs model. 
We use precision, recall and F1 value as the 
evaluation metrics.  
Table 1 gives the result of sentimental strength 
rating. Table 2 shows the polarity classification 
results extracted from the results of sentimental 
strength rating in Table 1. The extraction process is 
as follows. In the sentimental strength rating 
results, we combine the sentences with ?PP? class 
and the sentences with ?P? class into ?Pos? class, 
and the sentences with ?NN? class and the 
sentences with ?N? class into ?Neg? class. So the 
results of five-class classification are transformed 
into the results of three-class classification. Table 3 
is the results of performing polarity classification 
in the data set by CRFs directly.

Table 3. Result of Polarity Classification 
119
From the results we can find the following 
phenomena.  
(1) The corpus is severely unbalanced, the 
objective sentences take the absolute majority in 
the corpus, which leads to the poor accuracy for 
classifying subjective sentences. The experiment in 
Table 1 puts polarity classification and sentimental 
strength rating under a unique CRFs model, 
without considering the redundancy and 
hierarchical structure between different classes. As 
a result, the features for polarity classification will 
usually cover the features for sentimental strength 
rating. These reasons can explain why there is only 
one sample labeled as ?NN? correctly and only 5 
samples labeled as ?PP? correctly. 
(2) Comparing Table 2 with 3, we can find that, 
the F1 value of the polarity classification results 
extracted from sentimental strength rating results is 
lower than that of directly conducting polarity 
classification. That is because the redundancy 
between sentimental strength labels makes the 
classifier confused to determine the polarity of the 
sentence. Therefore, we should deal with the 
sentiment analysis in a hierarchical frame which 
can consider the redundancy between the different 
classes and make full use of the subjective and 
polarity information implicitly contained in 
sentimental strength classes. 
4 Capturing Label Redundancy for CRFs 
via Adding Redundant Features 
As mentioned above, it?s important for a classifier 
to consider the redundancy between different 
labels. However, from the standard CRFs 
described in formula (1), we can see that the 
training of CRFs only maximizes the probabilities 
of the observed labels Y  in the training corpus. 
Actually, the redundant relation between sentiment 
labels is unobserved. The standard CRFs still treats 
each class as an isolated item so that its 
performance is not satisfied.  
In this section, we propose a novel method for 
sentiment classification, which can capture the 
redundant relation between sentiment labels 
through adding redundant features. In the 
following, we firstly show how to add these 
redundant features, then illustrate the 
characteristics of this method. After that, for the 
sentiment analysis task, the process of feature 
generation will be presented. 
4.1 Adding Redundant Features for CRFs 
Adding redundant features has two steps. Firstly, 
an implicit redundant label set is designed, which 
can form a multi-layer hierarchical structure 
together with the original labels. Secondly, in the 
hierarchical classification framework, the implicit 
labels, which reflect the relations between the 
original labels, can be used as redundant features 
in the training process. We will use the following 
example to illustrate the first step for sentimental 
strength rating task.  
For the task of sentimental strength rating, the 
original label set is {?PP (highly praised)?, ?P 
(something good)?, ?Neu (objective description)?, 
?N (something that needs improvement)? and ?NN 
(strong aversion)?}. In order to introduce 
redundant labels, the 5-class classification task is 
decomposed into the following three layers shown 
in Figure 1. The label set in the first layer is 
{?subjective?, ?objective?}, The label set in the 
second layer is for polarity classification 
{?positive?, ?objective?, ?negative?}, and the label 
set in the third layer is the original set.  Actually, 
the labels in the first and second layers are 
unobserved redundant labels, which will not be 
reflected in the final classification result obviously.

 sentimental labels 
In the second step, with these redundant labels, 
some implicit features can be generated for CRFs. 
So the standard CRFs can be rewritten as follows.

where 1 2( ), ,... ...,j mT Y Y Y Y= , and jY denotes the 
label sequence in the jth layer. ( , )j jF X Y denotes 
the arbitrary feature function in the jth layer. 
From the formula (2), we can see that the 
original label set is rewritten as 
1 2( ), ,... ...,j mT Y Y Y Y= , which contains implicit 
labels in the hierarchical structure shown in Figure 
1. The difference between our method and the 
standard chain CRFs is that we make some implicit 
redundant features to be active when training. The 
original feature function ( , )F Y X is replaced by 
1
( , )
m
j j
j
F X Y
=
? . We use an example to illustrate the 
process of feature generation. When a sentence 
including the word ?good? is labeled as ?PP?, our 
model not only generate the state feature (good, 
?PP?), but also two implicit redundant state feature 
(good, ?positive?) and (good, ?subjective?). 
Through adding larger-granularity labels ?positive? 
and ?negative? into the model, our method can 
increase the probability of ?positive? and decrease 
the probability of ?negative?. Furthermore, ?P? and 
?PP? will share the probability gain of ?positive?, 
therefore the probability of ?P? will be larger than 
that of ?N?. For the transition feature, the same 
strategy is used. Therefore the complexity of its 
training procedure is ( )
m
j
j
O M N F l? ? ??  where M 
is the number of the training samples, N is the 
average sentence length, jF  is the average number 
of activated features in the jth layer, l  is the 
number of the original labels and m is the number 
of the layers. For the complexity of the decoding 
procedure, our method has ( )
m
j
j
O N F l? ?? . 
It?s worth noting that, (1) transition features are 
extracted in each layer separately rather than 
across different layers. For example, feature (good, 
?subjective?, ?positive?) will never be extracted 
because ?subjective? and ?positive? are from 
different layers; (2) if one sentence is labeled as 
?Neu?, no implicit redundant features will be 
generated.  
4.2 The Characteristics of Our Method 
Our method allows that the label sets are 
dependent and redundant. As a result, it can 
improve the performance of not only the classifier 
for the original sentimental strength rating task, but 
also the classifiers for other tasks in the 
hierarchical frame, i.e. polarity classification and 
subjective/objective classification. This kind of 
dependency and redundancy can lead to two 
characteristics of the proposed method for 
sentiment classification compared with traditional 
methods, such as the cascaded method. 
(1) Error-correction: Two dependent tasks in the 
neighboring layers can correct the errors of each 
other relying on the inconsistent redundant 
information. For example, if in the first layer, the 
features activated by ?objective? get larger scores 
than the features activated by ?subjective?, and in 
the second layer the features activated by 
?positive? get larger scores than the features 
activated by ?objective?, then inconsistency 
emerges. At this time, our method can globally 
select the label with maximum probability. This 
characteristic can make up the deficiency of the 
cascaded method which may induce error 
propagation. 
(2) Differentiating the ordinal relation among 
sentiment labels: Our method organizes the ordinal 
sentiment labels into a hierarchy through 
introducing redundant labels into standard chain 
CRFs, in this way the degree of classification 
errors can be controlled. In the different layers of 
sentiment analysis task, the granularities of 
classification are different. Therefore, when an 
observation cannot be correctly labeled on a 
smaller-granularity label set, our method will use 
the larger-granularity labels in the upper layer to 
control the final classification labels.  
4.3 Feature Selection in Different Layers 
For feature selection, our method selects different 
features for each layer in the hierarchical frame. 
In the top layer of the frame shown in Figure 1, 
for subjective/objective classification task, we use 
121
not only adjectives and the verbs which contain 
subjective information (e.g., ?believe?, ?think?) as 
the features, but also the topic words. The topic 
words are defined as the nouns or noun phases 
which frequently appear in the corpus. We believe 
that some topic words contain subjective 
information. 
In the middle and bottom layers, we not only use 
the features in the first layer, but also some special 
features as follows.  
(1) The prior orientation scores of the sentiment 
words: Firstly, a sentiment lexicon is generated by 
extending the synonymies and antonyms in 
WordNet2 from a positive and negative seed list. 
Then, the positive score and the negative score of a 
sentiment word are individually accumulated and 
weighted according to the polarity of its 
synonymies and antonyms. At last we scale the 
normalized distance of the two scores into 5 levels, 
which will be the prior orientation of the word. 
When there is a negative word, like {not, no, can?t, 
merely, never, ?}, occurring nearby the feature 
word in the range of 3 words size window, the 
orientation of this word will be reversed and ?NO? 
will be added in front of the original feature word 
for creating a new feature word.  
(2) Sentence transition features: We consider two 
types of sentence transition features. The first type 
is the conjunctions and the adverbs occurring in the 
beginning of this sentence. These conjunctions and 
adverbs are included in a word list which is 
manually selected, like {and, or, but, though, 
however, generally, contrarily, ?}. The second 
type of the sentence transition feature is the 
position of the sentence in one review. The reason 
lies in that: the reviewers often follow some 
writing patterns, for example some reviewers 
prefer to concede an opposite factor before 
expressing his/her real sentiment. Therefore, we 
divide a review into five parts, and assign each 
sentence with the serial number of the part which 
the sentence belongs to. 
5 Experiments 
5.1 Data and Baselines 
In order to evaluate the performance of our method, 
we conducted experiments on a sentence level

annotation corpus obtained from Purdue University, 
which is also used in (Mao and Lebanon 07). This 
corpus contains 249 movie reviews and 7,610 
sentences totally, which is randomly selected from 
the Cornell sentence polarity dataset v1.0. Each 
sentence was hand-labeled with one of five classes: 
PP (highly praised), P (something good), Neu 
(objective description), N (something that needs 
improvement) and NN (strong aversion), which 
contained the orientation polarity of each sentence. 
Based on the 5-class manually labeled results 
mentioned above, we also assigned each sentence 
with one of three classes: Pos (positive polarity), 
Neu (objective description), Neg (negative 
polarity). Data statistics for the corpus are given in 
Table 4.

Table 4. Data Statistics for Movies Reviews 
Corpus 
There is a problem in the dataset that more than 
70% of the sentences are labeled as ?Neu? and 
labels are seriously unbalanced. As a result, the 
?Neu? label is over-emphasized. For this problem, 
Mao and Lebanon (2007) made a balanced data set 
(equal number sentences for different labels) which 
is sampled in the original corpus. Since randomly 
sampling sentences from the original corpus will 
break the intrinsic relationship between two 
adjacent sentences in the context, we don?t create 
balanced label data set. 
For the evaluation of our method, we choose 
accuracy as the evaluation metrics and some 
classical methods as the baselines. They are Na?ve 
Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), 
Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) (Kamal Nigam et al 
1999) and standard chain CRFs (Fei et al 2003). 
We also regard cascaded-CRFs as our baseline for 
comparing our method with the cascaded-based 
method. For NB, we use Laplace smoothing 
method. For SVM, we use the LibSVM3  with a 
linear kernel function4. For MaxEnt, we use the 
implementation in the toolkit Mallet5. For CRFs,

we use the implementation in Flex-CRFs6. We set 
the iteration number to 120 in the training process 
of the method based on CRFs. In the cascaded 
model we set 3 layers for sentimental strength 
rating, where the first layer is subjective/objective 
classification, the second layer is polarity 
classification and the last layer is sentimental 
strength classification. The upper layer passes the 
results as the input to the next layer. 
5.2 Sentimental Strength Rating 
In the first experiment, we evaluate the 
performance of our method for sentimental 
strength rating. Experimental results for each 
method are given in Table 5. We not only give the 
overall accuracy of each method, but also the 
performance for each sentimental strength label. 
All baselines use the same feature space mentioned 
in section 4.3, which combine all the features in 
the three layers together, except cascaded CRFs 
and our method. In cascaded-CRFs and our method, 
we use different features in different layers 
mentioned in section 4.3. These results were 
gathered using 5-fold cross validation with one 
fold for testing and the other 4 folds for training.  
From the results, we can obtain the following 
conclusions. (1) The three versions of CRFs 
perform consistently better than Na?ve Bayes, 
                                                           
6 http://flexcrfs.sourceforge.net 
SVM and MaxEnt methods. We think that is 
because CRFs model considers the contextual 
influence of each sentence. (2) Comparing the 
performance of cascaded CRFs with that of 
standard sequence CRFs, we can see that not only 
the overall accuracy but also the accuracy for each 
sentimental strength label are improved, where the 
overall accuracy is increased by 3%. It proves that 
taking the hierarchical relationship between labels 
into account is very essential for sentiment 
classification. The reason is that: the cascaded 
model performs sentimental strength rating in three 
hierarchical layers, while standard chain CRFs 
model treats each label as an independent 
individual. So the performance of the cascaded 
model is superior to the standard chain CRFs. (3) 
The experimental results also show that our 
method performs better than the Cascaded CRFs. 
The classification accuracy is improved from 
71.53% to 75.21%. We think that is because our 
method adds the label redundancy among the 
sentimental strength labels into consideration 
through adding redundant features into the feature 
sets, and the three subtasks in the cascaded model 
are merged into a unified model. So the output 
result is a global optimal result. In this way, the 
problem of error propagation in the cascaded frame 
can be alleviated.

5.3 Sentiment Polarity Classification 
In the second experiment, we evaluate the 
performance of our method for sentiment polarity 
classification. Our method is based on a 
hierarchical frame, which can perform different 
tasks in different layers at the same time.  For 
example, it can determine the polarity of sentences 
when sentimental strength rating is performed. 
Here, the polarity classification results of our 
method are extracted from the results of the 
sentimental strength rating mentioned above. In the 
sentimental strength rating results, we combine the 
sentences with PP label and the sentences with P 
label into one set, and the sentences with NN label 
and the sentences with N label into one set. So the 
results of 5-class classification are transformed into 
the results of 3-class classification. Other methods 
like NB, SVM, MaxEnt, standard chain CRFs 
perform 3-class classification directly, and their 
label sets in the training corpus is {Pos, Neu, Neg}. 
The parameter setting is the same as sentimental 
strength rating. For the cascaded-CRFs method, we 
firstly perform subjective/objective classification, 
and then determine the polarity of the sentences 
based on the subjective sentences. The 
experimental results are given in Table 6. 
From the experimental results, we can obtain the 
following conclusion for sentiment polarity 
classification, which is similar to the conclusion 
for sentimental strength rating mentioned in 
section 5.2. That is both our model and the 
cascaded model can get better performance than 
other traditional methods, such as NB, SVM, 
MaxEnt, etc. But the performance of the cascaded 
CRFs (76.94%) is lower than that of our method 
(78.55%). This indicates that because our method 
exploits the label redundancy in the different layers, 
it can increase the accuracies of both polarity 
classification and sentimental strength rating at the 
same time compared with other methods. 
5.4 Subjective/Objective Classification 
In the last experiment, we test our method for 
subjective/objective classification. The 
subjective/objective label of the data is extracted 
from its original label like section 5.3. As the same 
as the experiment for polarity classification, all 
baselines perform subjective/objective 
classification directly. It?s no need to perform the 
cascaded-based method because it?s a 2-class task. 
The results of our method are extracted from the 
results of the sentimental strength rating too. The 
results are shown in Table 7. From it, we can 
obtain the similar conclusion, i.e. our method 
outperforms other methods and has the 80.18% 
classification accuracy. Our method, which 
introduces redundant features into training, can 
increase the accuracies of all tasks in the different 
layers at the same time compared with other 
baselines. It proves that considering label 
redundancy are effective for promoting the 
performance of a sentimental classifier. 
6 Related Works 
Recently, many researchers have devoted into the 
problem of the sentiment classification. Most of 
researchers focus on how to extract useful textual 
features (lexical, syntactic, punctuation, etc.) for 
determining the semantic orientation of the 
sentences using machine learning algorithm (Bo et 
al. 2002; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Bo et al 2005, Hu 
et al 2004; Alina et al2008; Alistair et al2006). 
But fewer researchers deal with this problem using 
CRFs model.  
For identifying the subjective sentences, there 
are several research, like (Wiebe et al 2005). For 
polarity classification on sentence level, (Kim and 
Hovy, 2004) judged the sentiment by classifying a 
pseudo document composed of synonyms of 
indicators in one sentence. (Pang and Lee, 04) 
proposed a semi-supervised machine learning 
method based on subjectivity detection and 
minimum-cut in graph.  
Cascaded models for sentiment classification 
were studied by (Pang and Lee, 2005). Their work 
mainly used the cascaded frame for determining 
the orientation of a document and the sentences. In 
that work, an initial model is used to determine the 
orientation of each sentence firstly, then the top 
subjective sentences are input into a document -
level model to determine the document?s 
orientation.  
The CRFs has previously been used for 
sentiment classification. Those methods based on 
CRFs are related to our work. (Mao et al 2007) 
used a sequential CRFs regression model to 
measure the polarity of a sentence in order to 
determine the sentiment flow of the authors in 
reviews. However, this method must manually 
124
select a word set for constraints, where each 
selected word achieved the highest correlation with 
the sentiment. The performance of isotonic CRFs 
is strongly related to the selected word set. 
(McDonald et al2007; Ivan et al2008) proposed a 
structured model based on CRFs for jointly 
classifying the sentiment of text at varying levels 
of granularity. They put the sentence level and 
document level sentiment analysis in an integrated 
model and employ the orientation of the document 
to influence the decision of sentence?s orientation. 
Both the above two methods didn?t consider the 
redundant and hierarchical relation between 
sentimental strength labels. So their methods 
cannot get better results for the problem mentioned 
in this paper. 
Another solution to this problem is to use a joint 
multi-layer model, such as dynamic CRFs, multi-
layer CRFs, etc. Such kind of models can treat the 
three sub-tasks in sentiment classification as a 
multi-task problem and can use a multi-layer or 
hierarchical undirected graphic to model the 
sentiment of sentences. The main difference 
between our method and theirs is that we consider 
the problem from the feature representation view. 
Our method expands the feature set according to 
the number of layers in the hierarchical frame. So 
the complexity of its decoding procedure is lower 
than theirs, for example the complexity of the 
multi-layer CRFs is ( )j
j
lO N F? ?? when 
decoding and our method only has ( )j
j
FO N l? ?? , 
where N is the average sentence length, jF  is the 
average number of activated features in the jth layer, 
l  is the number of the original labels. 
7 Conclusion and Future Work 
In the paper, we propose a novel method for 
sentiment classification based on CRFs in response 
to the two special characteristics of ?contextual 
dependency? and ?label redundancy? in sentence 
sentiment classification.  We try to capture the 
contextual constraints on the sentence sentiment 
using CRFs. For capturing the label redundancy 
among sentiment classes, we generate a 
hierarchical framework through introducing 
redundant labels, under which redundant features 
can be introduced. The experimental results prove 
that our method outperforms the traditional 
methods (like NB, SVM, ME and standard chain 
CRFs). In comparison with cascaded CRFs, our 
method can effectively alleviate error propagation 
among different layers and obtain better 
performance in each layer.  
For our future work, we will explore other 
hierarchical models for sentimental strength rating 
because the experiments presented in this paper 
prove this hierarchical frame is effective for 
ordinal regression. We would expand the idea in 
this paper  into other models, such as Semi-CRFs 
and Hierarchical-CRFs.
