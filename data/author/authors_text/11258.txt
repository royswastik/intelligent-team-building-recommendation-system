Abstract
This paper presents a novel, ranking-style
word segmentation approach, called RSVM-
Seg, which is well tailored to Chinese informa-
tion retrieval(CIR). This strategy makes seg-
mentation decision based on the ranking of the
internal associative strength between each pair
of adjacent characters of the sentence. On the
training corpus composed of query items, a
ranking model is learned by a widely-used tool
Ranking SVM, with some useful statistical
features, such as mutual information, differ-
ence of t-test, frequency and dictionary infor-
mation. Experimental results show that, this
method is able to eliminate overlapping am-
biguity much more effectively, compared to
the current word segmentation methods. Fur-
thermore, as this strategy naturally generates
segmentation results with different granular-
ity, the performance of CIR systems is im-
proved and achieves the state of the art.
1 Introduction
To improve information retrieval systems? perfor-
mance, it is important to comprehend both queries
and corpus precisely. Unlike English and other
western languages, Chinese does not delimit words
by white-space. Word segmentation is therefore a
key preprocessor for Chinese information retrieval
to comprehend sentences.
Due to the characteristics of Chinese, two main
problems remain unresolved in word segmentation:
segmentation ambiguity and unknown words, which
are also demonstrated to affect the performance of
Chinese information retrieval (Foo and Li, 2004).
Overlapping ambiguity and combinatory ambiguity
are two forms of segmentation ambiguity. The first
one refers to that ABC can be segmented into AB
C or A BC. The second one refers to that string
AB can be a word, or A can be a word and B can
be a word. In CIR, the combinatory ambiguity is
also called segmentation granularity problem (Fan
et al, 2007). There are many researches on the
relationship between word segmentation and Chi-
nese information retrieval (Foo and Li, 2004; Peng
et al, 2002a; Peng et al, 2002b; Jin and Wong,
2002). Their studies show that the segmentation
accuracy does not monotonically influence subse-
quent retrieval performance. Especially the overlap-
ping ambiguity, as shown in experiments of (Wang,
2006), will cause more performance decrement of
CIR. Thus a CIR system with a word segmenter bet-
ter solving the overlapping ambiguity, may achieve
better performance. Besides, it also showed that the
precision of new word identification was more im-
portant than the recall.
There are some researches show that when com-
pound words are split into smaller constituents, bet-
ter retrieval results can be achieved (Peng et al,
2002a). On the other hand, it is reasonable that the
longer the word which co-exists in query and cor-
pus, the more similarity they may have. A hypothe-
sis, therefore, comes to our mind, that different seg-
mentation granularity can be incorporated to obtain
better CIR performance.
In this paper we present a novel word segmenta-
tion approach for CIR, which can not only obviously
reduce the overlapping ambiguity, but also introduce
different segmentation granularity for the first time.
1061
In our method, we first predict the ranking result of
all internal association strength (IAS) between each
pair of adjacent characters in a sentence using Rank-
ing SVM model, and then, we segment the sentence
into sub-sentences with smaller and smaller granu-
larity by cutting adjacent character pairs according
to this rank. Other machine-learning based segmen-
tation algorithms (Zhang et al, 2003; Lafferty et al,
2001; Ng and Low, 2004) treat segmentation prob-
lem as a character sequence tagging problem based
on classification. However, these methods cannot di-
rectly obtain different segmentation granularity. Ex-
periments show that our method can actually im-
prove information retrieval performance.
This paper is structured as follows. It starts with
a brief introduction of the related work on the word
segmentation approaches. Then in Section 3, we in-
troduce our segmentation method. Section 4 evalu-
ates the method based on experimental results. Fi-
nally, Section 5 makes summary of this whole paper
and proposes the future research orientation.
2 Related Work
Various methods have been proposed to address
the word segmentation problem in previous studies.
They fall into two main categories, rule-based ap-
proaches that make use of linguistic knowledge and
statistical approaches that train on corpus with ma-
chine learning methods. In rule-based approaches,
algorithms of string matching based on dictionary
are the most commonly used, such as maximum
matching. They firstly segment sentences accord-
ing to a dictionary and then resort to some rules
to resolve ambiguities (Liu, 2002; Luo and Song,
2001). These rule-based methods are fast, how-
ever, their performances depend on the dictionary
which cannot include all words, and also on the rules
which cost a lot of time to make and must be up-
dated frequently. Recent years statistical approaches
became more popular. These methods take advan-
tage of various probability information gained from
large corpus to segment sentences. Among them,
Wang?s work (Wang, 2006) is the most similar to
our method, since both of us apply statistics infor-
mation of each gap in the sentence to eliminate over-
lapping ambiguity in methods. However, when com-
bining different statistics, Wang decided the weight
by a heuristic way which was too simply to be suit-
able for all sentences. In our method, we employ a
machine-learning method to train features? weights.
Many machine-learning methods, such as
HMM (Zhang et al, 2003), CRF (Lafferty et al,
2001), Maximum Entropy (Ng and Low, 2004),
have been exploited in segmentation task. To our
knowledge, machine-learning methods used in seg-
mentation treated word segmentation as a character
tagging problem. According to the model trained
from training corpus and features extracted from the
context in the sentence, these methods assign each
character a positional tag, indicating its relative po-
sition in the word. These methods are difficult to get
different granularity segmentation results directly.
Our method has two main differences with them.
Firstly, we tag the gap between characters rather
than characters themselves. Secondly, our method
is based on ranking rather than classification.
Then, we will present our ranking-based segmen-
tation method, RSVM-Seg.
3 Ranking based Segmentation
Traditional segmentation methods always take the
segmentation problem as classification problem and
give a definite segmentation result. In our approach,
we try to solve word segmentation problem from the
view of ranking. For easy understanding, let?s rep-
resent a Chinese sentence S as a character sequence:
C1:n = C1C2 . . . Cn
We also explicitly show the gap Gi(i = 1 . . . n? 1)
between every two adjacent characters Ci and Ci+1:
C1:n|G1:n?1 = C1G1C2G2 . . . Gn?1Cn
IASi(i = 1 . . . n) is corresponding to Gi(i =
1 . . . n), reflecting the internal association strength
between Ci and Ci+1. The higher the IAS value is,
the stronger the associative between the two charac-
ters is. If the association between two characters is
weak, then they can be segmented. Otherwise, they
should be unsegmented. That is to say we could
make segmentation based on the ranking of IAS
value. In our ranking-style segmentation method,
Ranking SVM is exploited to predict IAS ranking.
In next subsections, we will introduce how to
take advantage of Ranking SVM model to solve our
1062
problem. Then, we will describe features used for
training the Ranking SVM model. Finally, we will
give a scheme how to get segmentation result from
predicted ranking result of Ranking SVM.
3.1 Segmentation based on Ranking SVM
Ranking SVM is a classical algorithm for ranking,
which formalizes learning to rank as learning for
classification on pairs of instances and tackles the
classification issue by using SVM (Joachims, 2002).
Suppose that X?Rd is the feature space, where d is
the number of features, and Y = r1, r2, . . . , rK is
the set of labels representing ranks. And there exists
a total order between ranks r1 > r2 > . . . > rK ,
where > denotes the order relationship. The actual
task of learning is formalized as a Quadratic Pro-
gramming problem as shown below:
min?,???
1
2???
2 + C????
s.t.??, x? ? x?? > 1? ???,?x? ? x?, ??? ? 0
(1)
where ??? denotes l2 norm measuring the margin
of the hyperplane and ?ij denotes a slack variable.
xi ? xj means the rank class of xi has an order
prior to that of xj , i.e. Y (xi) > Y (xj). Suppose
that the solution to (1) is ??, then we can make the
ranking function as f(x) = ???, x?.
When applying Ranking SVM model to our prob-
lems, an instance (feature vector x) is created from
all bigrams (namely CiCi+1, i = 1 . . . n ? 1) of
a sentence in the training corpus. Each feature
is defined as a function of bigrams (we will de-
scribe features in detail in next subsection). The
instances from all sentences are then combined for
training. And Y refers to the class label of the
IAS degree. As we mentioned above, segmenta-
tion decision is based on IAS value. Therefore,
the number of IAS degree?s class label is also cor-
respondent to the number of segmentation class la-
bel. In traditional segmentation algorithms, they al-
ways label segmentation as two classes, segmented
and unsegmented. However, for some phrases, it is
a dilemma to make a segmentation decision based
on this two-class scheme. For example, Chinese
phrase ??????(Notepad)? can be segmented
as ????(Note)? and ???(computer)? or can
be viewed as one word. We cannot easily classify
the gap between ??? and ??? as segmented or un-
segmented. Therefore, beside these two class la-
bels, we define another class label, semisegmented,
which means that the gap between two characters
could be segmented or unsegmented, either will be
right. Correspondingly, IAS degree is also divided
into three classes, definitely inseparable (marked as
3), partially inseparable (marked as 2), and sepa-
rable (marked as 1). ?Separable? corresponds to
be segmented?; ?partially inseparable? corresponds
to semisegmented; ?definitely inseparable? corre-
sponds to be unsegmented. Obviously, there exists
orders between these labels? IAS values, namely
IAS(1) < IAS(2) < IAS(3), IAS(?) represents
the IAS value of different labels. Next, we will
describe the features used to train Ranking SVM
model.
3.2 Features for IAS computation
Mutual Information: Mutual information, mea-
suring the relationship between two variables, has
been extensively used in computational language re-
search. Given a Chinese character string ?xy? (as
mentioned above, in our method, ?xy? refers to bi-
gram in a sentence), mutual information between
characters x and y is defined as follows:
mi(x, y) = log2 p(x, y)p(x)p(y) (2)
where p(x, y) is the co-occurrence probability of x
and y, namely the probability that bigram ?xy? oc-
curs in the training corpus, and p(x), p(y) are the
independent probabilities of x and y respectively.
From (2), we conclude that mi(x, y) ? 0 means
that IAS is strong; mi(x, y) ? 0 means that it
is indefinite for IAS between characters x and y;
mi(x, y) ? 0 means that there is no association
been characters x and y. However, mutual infor-
mation has no consideration of context, so it can-
not solve the overlapping ambiguity effectively (Sili
Wang 2006). To remedy this defect, we introduce
another statistics measure, difference of t-test.
Difference of t-score (DTS): Difference of t-
score is proposed on the basis of t-score. Given
a Chinese character string ?xyz?, the t-score of the
character y relevant to character x and z is defined
1063
as:
tx,z(y) = p(z|y)? p(y|x)??2(p(z|y)) + ?2(p(y|x))
(3)
where p(y|x) is the conditional probability of y
given x, and p(z|y), of z given y, and ?2(p(y|x)),
?2(p(z|y)) are variances of p(y|x) and of p(z|y) re-
spectively. Sun et al gave the derivation formula of
?2(p(y|x)), ?2(p(z|y)) (Sun et al, 1997) as
?2(p(z|y)) ? r(y, z)r2(y) ?2(p(y|x)) ?
r(x, y)
r2(x) (4)
where r(x, y), r(y, z), r(y), r(z) are the frequency
of string xy, yz, y, and z respectively. Thus formula
(3) is deducted as
tx,z(y) =
r(y,z)
r(y) ?
r(x,y)
r(x)?
r(y,z)
r2(y) +
r(x,y)
r2(x)
(5)
tx,z(y) indicates the binding tendency of y in the
context of x and z: if tx,z(y) > 0 then y tends to
be bound with z rather than with x; if tx,z(y) < 0,
they y tends to be bound with x rather than with z.
To measure the binding tendency between two ad-
jacent characters ?xy? (also, it refers to bigram in a
sentence in our method), we use difference of t-score
(DTS) (Sun et al, 1998) which is defined as
dts(x, y) = tv,y(x)? tx,w(y) (6)
Higher dts(x, y) indicates stronger IAS between
adjacent characters x and y.
Dictionary Information: Both statistics mea-
sures mentioned above cannot avoid sparse data
problem. Then Dictionary Information is used to
compensate for the shortage of statistics informa-
tion. The dictionary we used includes 75784 terms.
We use binary value to denote the dictionary feature.
If a bigram is in the dictionary or a part of dictionary
term, we label it as ?1?, otherwise, we label is as ?0?.
Frequency: An important characteristic of new
word is its repeatability. Thus, we also use fre-
quency as another feature to train Ranking SVM
model. Here, the frequency is referred to the number
of times that a bigram occurs in the training corpus.
We give a training sentence for a better under-
standing of features mentioned above. The sentence

is ????????(China Construction Bank net-
work)? We extract all bigrams in this sentence, com-
pute the four above features and give the IAS a la-
bel for each bigram. The feature vectors of all these
bigrams for training are shown in Table 1.
3.3 Segmentation scheme
In order to compare with other segmentation meth-
ods, which give a segmentation result based on two
class labels, segmented and unsegmented, it is nec-
essary to convert real numbers result given by Rank-
ing SVM to these two labels. Here, we make a
heuristic scheme to segment the sentence based on
IAS ranking result predicted by Ranking SVM. The
scheme is described in Algorithm 1. In each itera-
tion we cut the sentence at the gap with minimum
IAS value. Nie et.al. pointed out that the average
length of words in usage is 1.59 (Nie et al, 2000).
Therefore, we stop the segmentation iterative when
the length of sub sentence is 2 or less than 2. By
this method, we could represent the segmentation re-
sult as a binary tree. Figure 1 shows an example of
this tree. With this tree, we can obtain various gran-
ularity segmentations easily, which could be used
in CIR. This segmentation scheme may cause some
combinatory ambiguity. However, Nie et.al. (Nie
et al, 2000) also pointed out that there is no accu-
rate word definition, thus whether combinatory am-
biguity occurs is uncertain. What?s more, compared
to overlapping ambiguity, combinatory ambiguity is
not the fatal factor for information retrieval perfor-
mance as mentioned in introduction. Therefore, this
scheme is reasonable for Chinese information re-

4 Experiments and analysis
4.1 Data
Since the label scheme and evaluation measure (de-
scribed in next subsection) of our segmentation
method are both different from the traditional seg-
mentation methods, we did not carry out experi-
ments on SIGHAN. Instead, we used two query logs
(QueryLog1 and QueryLog2) as our experiment cor-
pus, which are from two Chinese search engine com-
panies. 900 queries randomly from QueryLog1 were
chosen as training corpus. 110 Chinese queries from
PKU Tianwang1 , randomly selected 150 queries
from QueryLog1 and 100 queries from QueryLog2
were used as test corpus. The train and test cor-
pus have been tagged by three people. They were
given written information need statements, and were
asked to judge the IAS of every two adjacent char-
acters in a sentence on a three level scale as men-
tioned above, separable, partially inseparable, and
definitely inseparable. The assessors agreed in 84%
of the sentences, the other sentences were checked
1Title field of SEWM2006 and SEWM2007 web retrieval
TD task topics. See http://www.cwirf.org/
by all assessors, and a more plausible alternative was
selected. We exploited SVM light2 as the toolkit to
implement Ranking SVM model.
4.2 Evaluation Measure
Since our approach is based on the ranking of IAS
values, it is inappropriate to evaluate our method by
the traditional method used in other segmentation
algorithms. Here, we proposed an evaluation mea-
sure RankPrecision based on Kendall?s ? (Joachims,
2002), which compared the similarity between the
predicted ranking of IAS values and the rankings
of these tags as descending order. RankPrecision
formula is as follows:
RankPrecision =
1? ?
n
i=1InverseCount(si)
?ni=1CompInverseCount(si)
(7)
where si represents the ith sentence (unsegmented
string), InverseCount(si) represents the number
of discordant pairs inversions in the ranking of the
predicted IAS value compared to the correct labeled
ranking. CompInverseCount(si) represents the
number of discordant pairs inversions when the la-
bels totally inverse.
4.3 Experiments Results
Contributions of the Features: We investi-
gated the contribution of each feature by gen-
erating many versions of Ranking SVM model.
RankPrecision as described above was used for
evaluations in these and following experiments.
We used Mutual Information(MI); Difference
of T-Score(DTS); Frequency(F); mutual informa-
tion and difference of t-score(MI+DTS); mu-

improved step by step. It demonstrates that the

tion.

? The lowest RankPrecision is above 85%, which
suggests that the predicted rank result by our
approach is very close to the right rank. It is
shown that our method is effective.
? When we used each feature alone, difference
of t-score achieved highest RankPrecise, fre-
quency was worst on most of test corpus (ex-
cept TianWang). It is induced that difference
of t-test is the most effective feature for seg-
mentation. It is explained that because dts is
combined with the context information, which
eliminates overlapping ambiguity errors.
? It is surprising that when mutual information
and difference of t-score was combined with
1066
frequency, the RankPrecision was hurt on three
test corpus, even worse than dts feature. The
reason is supposed that some non-meaning but
common strings, such as ???? would be took
for a word with high IAS values. To correct
this error, we could build a stop word list, and
when we meet a character in this list, we treat
them as a white-space.
Effects of corpus size:We trained different Rank-
ing SVM models with different corpus size to in-
vestigate the effects of training corpus size to our
method performance. The results are shown in Ta-
ble 3 and Figure 3. From the results, we can see that
the effect of corpus size to the performance of our
approach is minors. Our segmentation approach can
achieve good performance even with small training
corpus, which indicates that Ranking SVM has gen-
eralization ability. Therefore we can use a relative
small corpus to train Ranking SVM, saving labeling
effort.
Effects on Finding Boundary: In algorithm
1, we could get different granularity segmentation
words when we chose different length as stop
condition. Figure 4 shows the ?boundary precision?
at each stop condition. Here, ?boundary precision?
is defined as
No.of right cut boundaries
No.of all cut boundaries (8)
From the result shown in figure 4, we can see
that as the segmentation granularity gets smaller, the
boundary precision gets lower. The reason is obvi-
ous, that we may segment a whole word into smaller
parts. However, as we analyzed in introduction, in
CIR, we should judge words boundaries correctly to
avoid overlapping ambiguity. As for combinatory
ambiguity, through setting different stop length con-
dition, we can obtain different granularity segmen-
tation result.
Effects on Overlapping Ambiguity: Due to the
inconsistency of train and test corpus, it is difficult to
keep fair for Chinese word segmentation evaluation.
Since ICTCLAS is considered as the best Chinese
word segmentation systems. We chose ICTCLAS
as the comparison object. Moreover, we chose
Maximum Match segmentation algorithm, which is
rule-based segmentation method, as the baseline.

Table 4: Number of Overlapping Ambiguity
We compared the number of overlapping ambigu-
ity(NOA) among these three approaches on test cor-
pus QueryLog1, QueryLog2 and TianWang. The re-
sult is shown in Table 4. On these three test cor-
pus, the NOA of our approach is smallest, which
indicates our method resolve overlapping ambiguity
more effectively. For example, the sentence ???
??(basic notes)?, the segmentation result of ICT-
CLAS is ????(basic class)/?(article)?, the word
???(notes)? is segmented, overlapping ambiguity
occurring. However, with our method, the predicted
IAS value rank of positions between every two ad-
jacent characters in this sentence is ??3?1?2??,
which indicates that the character ??? has stronger
internal associative strength with the character ???
than with the character ???, eliminating overlap-
ping ambiguity according to this ISA rank results.

Entry Recruitment)?, the ICTCLAS segmentation
result is ???/?/??/??, because the new word
???? cannot be recognized accurately, thus the
character ??? is combined with its latter charac-
ter ???, causing overlapping ambiguity. By our
method, the segmentation result is shown as figure
5, in which no overlapping ambiguity occurs.
Performance of Chinese Information Re-
trieval: To evaluate the effectiveness of RSVM-Seg
method on CIR, we compared it with the FMM seg-
mentation. Our retrieval system combines differ-
ent query representations obtained by our segmen-
tation method, RSVM-Seg. In previous TREC Tere-
byte Track, Markov Random Field(MRF) (Metzler
and Croft, 2005) model has displayed better perfor-
mance than other information retrieval models, and
it can much more easily include dependence fea-
tures. There are three variants of MRF model, full
independence(FI), sequential dependence(SD), and
full dependence(FD). We chose SD as our retrieval
model, since Chinese words are composed by char-
acters and the adjacent characters have strong de-
pendence relationship. We evaluated the CIR per-
formance on the Chinese Web Corpora CWT200g
provided by Tianwang 3, which, as we know, is
the largest publicly available Chinese web corpus
till now. It consists of 37, 482, 913 web pages
with total size of 197GB. We used the topic set

Table 5: Evaluation of CIR performance
for SEWM2007 and SEWM2006 Topic Distillation
(TD) task which contains 121 topics. MAP, R-
Precision and GMAP (Robertson, 2006) were as
main evaluation metrics. GMAP is the geometric
mean of AP(Average Precision) through different
queries, which was introduced to concentrate on dif-
ficult queries. The result is shown in 5. From the
table, we can see that our segmentation method im-
prove the CIR performance compared to FMM.
5 Conclusion and Future work
From what we have discussed above, we can safely
draw the conclusion that our work includes several
main contributions. Firstly, to our best known, this
is the first time to take the Chinese word segmenta-
tion problem as ranking problem, which provides a
new view for Chinese word segmentation. This ap-
proach has been proved to be able to eliminate over-
lapping ambiguity and also be able to obtain various
segmentation granularities. Furthermore, our seg-
mentation method can improve Chinese information
retrieval performance to some extent.
As future work, we would search another more
encouraging method to make a segmentation deci-
sion from the ranking result. Moreover, we will try
to relabel SIGHAN corpus on our three labels, and
do experiments on them, which will be more con-
venient to compare with other segmentation meth-
ods. Besides, we will carry out more experiments to
search the effectiveness of our segmentation method
to CIR.
