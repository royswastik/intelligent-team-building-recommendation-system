Abstract 
Relation extraction is a challenging task in 
natural language processing. Syntactic 
features are recently shown to be quite 
effective for relation extraction. In this 
paper, we generalize the state of the art 
syntactic convolution tree kernel 
introduced by Collins and Duffy. The 
proposed generalized kernel is more 
flexible and customizable, and can be 
conveniently utilized for systematic 
generation of more effective application 
specific syntactic sub-kernels. Using the 
generalized kernel, we will also propose a 
number of novel syntactic sub-kernels for 
relation extraction. These kernels show a 
remarkable performance improvement over 
the original Collins and Duffy kernel in the 
extraction of ACE-2005 relation types. 
1 Introduction 
One of the contemporary demanding NLP tasks is 
information extraction, which is the procedure of 
extracting structured information such as entities, 
relations, and events from free text documents. As 
an information extraction sub-task, semantic 
relation extraction is the procedure of finding 
predefined semantic relations between textual 
entity mentions. For instance, assuming a semantic 
relation with type Physical and subtype Located 
between an entity of type Person and another 
entity of type Location, the sentence "Police 
arrested Mark at the airport last week." conveys 
two mentions of this relation between "Mark" and 
"airport" and also between "police" and "airport" 
that can be shown in the following format. 
Phys.Located(Mark, airport) 
Phys.Located(police, airport) 
 Relation extraction is a key step towards 
question answering systems by which vital 
structured data is acquired from underlying free 
text resources. Detection of protein interactions in 
biomedical corpora (Li et al, 2008) is another 
valuable application of relation extraction. 
 Relation extraction can be approached by a 
standard classification learning method. We 
particularly use SVM (Boser et al, 1992; Cortes 
and Vapnik, 1995) and kernel functions as our 
classification method. A kernel is a function that 
calculates the inner product of two transformed 
vectors of a high dimensional feature space using 
the original feature vectors as shown in eq. 1. 
)().(),( jiji XXXXK ??=  (1) 
Kernel functions can implicitly capture a large 
amount of features efficiently; thus, they have been 
widely used in various NLP tasks.  
 Various types of features have been exploited so 
far for relation extraction. In (Bunescu and 
Mooney, 2005b) sequence of words features are 
utilized using a sub-sequence kernel. In (Bunescu 
and Mooney, 2005a) dependency graph features 
are exploited, and in (Zhang et al, 2006a) syntactic 
features are employed for relation extraction. 
Although in order to achieve the best performance, 
it is necessary to use a proper combination of these 
features (Zhou et al, 2005), in this paper, we will 
concentrate on how to better capture the syntactic 
features for relation extraction. 
66
 In CD?01 (Collins and Duffy, 2001) a 
convolution syntactic tree kernel is proposed that 
generally measures the syntactic similarity 
between parse trees. In this paper, a generalized 
version of CD?01 convolution tree kernel is 
proposed by associating generic weights to the 
nodes and sub-trees of the parse tree. These 
weights can be used to incorporate domain 
knowledge into the kernel and make it more 
flexible and customizable. The generalized kernel 
can be conveniently used to generate a variety of 
syntactic sub-kernels (including the original CD?01 
kernel), by adopting appropriate weighting 
mechanisms.  
 As a result, in this paper, novel syntactic sub-
kernels are generated from the generalized kernel 
for the task of relation extraction. Evaluations 
demonstrate that these kernels outperform the 
original CD?01 kernel in the extraction of ACE-
2005 main relation types  
 The remainder of this paper is structured as 
follows. In section 2, the most related works are 
briefly reviewed. In section 3, CD?01 tree kernel is 
described. The proposed generalized convolution 
tree kernel is explained in section 4 and its 
produced sub-kernels for relation extraction are 
illustrated in section 5. The experimental results 
are discussed in section 6. Our work is concluded 
in section 7 and some possible future works are 
presented in section 8. 
2 Related Work 
In (Collins and Duffy, 2001), a convolution parse 
tree kernel has been introduced. This kernel is 
generally designed to measure syntactic similarity 
between parse trees and is especially exploited for 
parsing English sentences in their paper. Since 
then, the kernel has been widely used in different 
applications such as semantic role labeling 
(Moschitti, 2006b) and relation extraction (Zhang 
et al, 2006a; Zhang et al, 2006b; Zhou et al, 
2007; Li et al 2008). 
 For the first time, in (Zhang et al, 2006a), this 
convolution tree kernel was used for relation 
extraction. Since the whole syntactic parse tree of 
the sentence that holds the relation arguments 
contains a plenty of misleading features, several 
parse tree portions are studied to find the most 
feature-rich portion of the syntactic tree for 
relation extraction, and Path-Enclosed Tree (PT) is 
finally found to be the best performing tree 
portion. PT is a portion of parse tree that is 
enclosed by the shortest path between the two 
relation arguments. Moreover, this tree kernel is 
combined with an entity kernel to form a 
reportedly high quality composite kernel in (Zhang 
et al, 2006b). 
3 CD?01 Convolution Tree Kernel  
In (Collins and Duffy, 2001), a convolution tree 
kernel has been introduced that measures the 
syntactic similarity between parse trees. This 
kernel computes the inner products of the 
following feature vector.

(2) 
Each feature of this vector is the occurrence count 
of a sub-tree type in the parse tree decayed 
exponentially by the parameter ? . Without this 
decaying mechanism used to retain the kernel 
values within a fairly small range, the value of the 
kernel for identical trees becomes far higher than 
its value for different trees. Term isize  is defined 
to be the number of rules or internal nodes of the ith 
sub-tree type. Samples of such sub-trees are shown 
in Fig. 1 for a simple parse tree. Since the number 
of sub-trees of a tree is exponential in its size 
(Collins and Duffy, 2001), direct inner product 
calculation is computationally infeasible. 
Consequently, Collins and Duffy (2001) proposed 
an ingenious kernel function that implicitly 
calculates the inner product in )( 21 NNO ?  time 
on the trees of size 1N  and 2N . 
4 A Generalized Convolution Tree 
Kernel  
In order to describe the kernel, a feature vector 
over the syntactic parse tree is firstly defined in eq. 
(3), in which the ith feature equals the weighted 
sum of the number of instances of sub-tree type ith 
in the tree. 
Function )(nI
isubtree
 is an indicator function that 
returns 1 if the isubtree  occurs with its root at 
node n and 0 otherwise. As described in eq. (4), 
67
function tw(T) (which stands for "tree weight") 
assigns a weight to a tree T which is equal to the 
product of the weights of all its nodes.

 Since each node of the whole syntactic tree can 
either happen as an internal node or as an external 
node of a supposed sub-tree (presuming its 
existence in the sub-tree), two types of weights are 
respectively associated to each node by the 
functions )(ninw  and )(nenw  (which respectively 
stand for "internal node weight" and "external node 
weight"). For instance, in Fig. 1, the node with 
label PP is an external node for sub-trees (1) and 
(7) while it is an internal node of sub-trees (3) and 
(4).

 As shown in eq. (5), A similar procedure to 
(Collins and Duffy, 2001) can be employed to 
develop a kernel function for the calculation of dot 
products on H(T) vectors. According to eq. (5) the 
calculation of the kernel finally leads to the sum of 
a ),( 21 nnCgc  function over all tree node pairs of T1 
and T2. Function ),( 21 nnCgc  is the weighted sum of 
the common sub-trees rooted at 1n  and n2, and can 
be recursively computed in a similar way to 
function ),( 21 nnC  of (Collins and Duffy, 2001) as 
follows.

different then 0),( 21 =nnCgc

 In the first case, when the two nodes represent 
different production rules they can't accordingly 
have any sub-trees in common. In the second case, 
there is exactly one common sub-tree of size two. 
It should be noted that all the leaf nodes of the tree 
(or words of the sentence) are considered identical 
in the calculation of the tree kernel. The value of 
the function in this case is the weight of this 
common sub-tree. In the third case, when the nodes 
generally represent the same production rules the 
weighted sum of the common sub-trees are 
calculated recursively. The equation holds because 
the existence of common sub-trees rooted at n1 and 
n2 implies the existence of common sub-trees 
rooted at their corresponding children, which can 
be combined multiplicatively to form their parents' 
common sub-trees. 
 Due to the equivalent procedure of kernel 
calculation, this generalized version of the tree 
kernel preserves the nice )( 21 NNO ?  time 
complexity property of the original kernel. It is 
worthy of note that in (Moschitti, 2006b) a sorting 
based method is proposed for the fast 
implementation of such tree kernels that reduces 
the average running time to )( 21 NNO + . 
 The generalized kernel can be converted to 
CD?01 kernel by defining ?=)(ninw  and 
1)( =nenw . Likewise, other definitions can be 
utilized to produce other useful sub-kernels.

5 Kernels for Relation Extraction 
In this section, three sub-kernels of the generalized 
convolution tree kernel will be proposed for 
relation extraction. Using the embedded weights of 
the generalized kernel, these sub-kernels 
differentiate among sub-trees based on their 
expected relevance to semantic relations. More 
specifically, the sub-trees are weighted according 
to how their nodes interact to the arguments of the 
relation. 
5.1 Argument Ancestor Path Kernel (AAP) 
Definition of weighting functions is shown in eq. 
(6) and (7). Parameter 10 ?< ?  is a decaying 
parameter similar to ? .

This weighting method is equivalent to applying 
CD?01 tree kernel (by setting 2?? = ) on a portion 
of the parse tree that exclusively includes the 
arguments ancestor nodes and their direct children.

(9) 
Definition of weighting functions is shown in eq. 
(8) and (9). Both functions have identical 
definitions for this kernel. 
Function AAPDist(n,arg) calculates the distance of 
the node n from the argument arg on the parse tree 
as illustrated by Fig. 2. MAX_DIST is used for 
normalization, and is the maximum of 
AAPDist(n,arg) in the whole tree. In this way, the 
closer a tree node is to one of the arguments 
ancestor path, the less it is decayed by this 
weighting method.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.3 Threshold Sensitive Argument Ancestor 
Path Distance Kernel (TSAAPD) 
This kernel is intuitively similar to the previous 
kernel but uses a rough threshold based decaying 
technique instead of a smooth one. The definition 
of weighting functions is shown in eq. (10) and 
(11). Both functions are again identical in this case.

6.1 Experiments Setting 
The proposed kernels are evaluated on ACE-2005 
multilingual corpus (Walker et al, 2006). In order 
to avoid parsing problems, the more formal parts 
of the corpus in "news wire" and "broadcast news" 
sections are used for evaluation as in (Zhang et al, 
2006b).

Table 1: The F1-Measure value is shown for every kernel on each ACE-2005 main relation type. For every relation 
type the best result is shown in bold font. 
 
 We have used LIBSVM (Chang and Lin 2001) 
java source for the SVM classification and 
Stanford NLP package1 for tokenization, sentence 
segmentation and parsing.  
 Following [Bunescu and Mooney, 2007], every 
pair of entities within a sentence is regarded as a 
negative relation instance unless it is annotated as a 
positive relation in the corpus. The total number of 
negative training instances, constructed in this 
way, is about 20 times more than the number of 
annotated positive instances. Thus, we also 
imposed the restriction of maximum argument 
distance of 10 words. This constraint eliminates 
half of the negative constructed instances while 
slightly decreases positive instances. Nevertheless, 
since the resulted training set is still unbalanced, 
we used LIBSVM weighting mechanism. 
Precisely, if there are P positive and N negative 
instances in the training set, a weight value of 
PN /  is used for positive instances while the 
default weight value of 1 is used for negative ones. 
 A binary SVM is trained for every relation type 
separately, and type compatible annotated and 
constructed relation instances are used to train it. 
For each relation type, only type compatible 
relation instances are exploited for training. For 
example to learn an ORG-AFF relation (which 
applies to (PER, ORG) or (ORG, ORG) argument 
types) it is meaningless to use a relation instance 
between two entities of type PERSON. Moreover, 
the total number of training instances used for 
training every relation type is restricted to 5000 
instances to shorten the duration of the evaluation 
process. The reported results are achieved using a 
5-fold cross validation method. 
 The kernels AAP, AAPD and TSAAPD-0 
(TSAAPD with threshold = 0) and TSAAPD-1 
(TSAAPD with threshold = 1) are compared with 
CD?01 convolution tree kernel. All the kernels 
                                                          
1 http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/index.shtml 
except for AAP are computed on the PT portion 
described in section 2. AAP is computed over the 
MCT tree portion which is also proposed by 
(Zhang et al, 2006a) and is the sub-tree rooted at 
the first common ancestor of relation arguments.  
 For the proposed kernels ?  is set to 0.44 which 
is tuned on a development set that contained 5000 
instances of type PHYS. The ?  parameter of 
CD?01 kernel is set to 0.4 according to (Zhang et 
al., 2006a). The C parameter of SVM classification 
is set to 2.4 for all the kernels after tuning it 
individually for each kernel on the mentioned 
development set. 
6.2 Experiments Results 
The results of the experiments are shown in Table 
1. The proposed kernels outperform the original 
CD?01 kernel in four of the six relation types. The 
performance of TSAAPD-1 is especially 
remarkable because it is the best kernel in ORG-
AFF and PER-SOC relations. It particularly 
performs very well in the extraction of PER-SOC 
relation with an F1-measure of 0.73. It should be 
noted that the general low performance of all the 
kernels on the GEN-AFF type is because of its 
extremely small number of annotated instances in 
the training set (40 in 5000). The AAPD kernel has 
the best performance with a remarkable 
improvement over the Collins kernel in GEN-AFF 
relation type. 
 The results clearly demonstrate that the nodes 
closer to the ancestor path of relation arguments 
contain the most useful syntactic features for 
relation extraction 
7 Conclusion  
In this paper, we proposed a generalized 
convolution tree kernel that can generate various 
syntactic sub-kernels including the CD?01 kernel. 
Kernel 
Relation 
70
The kernel is generalized by assigning weights to 
the sub-trees. The weight of a sub-tree is the 
product of the weights assigned to its nodes by two 
types of weighting functions. In this way, impacts 
of the tree nodes on the kernel value can be 
discriminated purposely based on the application. 
Context information can also be injected to the 
kernel via context sensitive weighting mechanisms. 
 Using the generalized kernel, various sub-
kernels can be produced by different definitions of 
the two weighting functions. We consequently 
used the generalized kernel for systematic 
generation of useful kernels in relation extraction. 
In these kernels, the closer a node is to the relation 
arguments ancestor paths, the less it is decayed by 
the weighting functions. Evaluation on the ACE-
2005 main relation types demonstrates the 
effectiveness of the proposed kernels. They show 
remarkable performance improvement over CD?01 
kernel.  
8 Future Work 
Although the path-enclosed tree portion (PT) 
(Zhang et al, 2006a) seems to be an appropriate 
portion of the syntactic tree for relation extraction, 
it only takes into account the syntactic information 
between the relation arguments, and discards many 
useful features (before and after the arguments 
features). It seems that the generalized kernel can 
be used with larger tree portions that contain 
syntactic features before and after the arguments, 
because it can be more easily targeted to related 
features. 
 Currently, the proposed weighting mechanisms 
are solely based on the location of the tree nodes in 
the parse tree; however other useful information 
such as labels of nodes can also be used in 
weighting. 
 Another future work can be utilizing the 
generalized kernel for other applicable NLP tasks 
such as co-reference resolution.
