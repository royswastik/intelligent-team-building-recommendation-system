Abstract 
A corpus -based diachronic analysis of 
patent documents, based mainly on the 
morphologically productive use of certain 
terms can help in tracking the evolution of 
key developments in a rapidly e volving 
specialist field.  The patent texts were o b-
tained from the US Patent & Trade Marks 
Office?s on-line service and the terms 
were extracted automatically from the 
texts.  The chosen specialist field was that 
of fast-switching devices and systems.  
The method presented draws from liter a-
ture on biblio - and sciento -metrics, infor-
mation extraction, corpus linguistics, and 
on aspects of English morphology.  This 
interdisciplinary fram ework shows that 
the evolution of word -formation closely 
shadows the developments in a field of 
technology. 
Introduction 
A patent document is written to pe rsuade a techno-
legal authority that the patentee should be allowed 
to manufacture, sell, or deal in an article to the ex-
clusion of other persons.  The article is typ ically 
based on an invention that the patentee(s) claim 
has been theirs.  The term article  is important in 
that it refers to a tangible object and its u sage is to  
emphasise that ideas, intangibles essentially, ca n-
not be patented. Patent documents are the repos i-
tory of how technology advances and, more 
importantly, show how language supports the 
change. 
The techno-legal authority requires the patent 
document to follow a template.  This template is 
divided broadly into two parts: first, legal te m-
plates comprising pate ntee?s details, juri sdictional 
scope, and related item; second, technical 
templates divided into a summary of the patentee?s 
claims, relation of the article to previously patented 
articles ? the so-called prior art  ? and the scien-
tific/technical basis of t he claim.  The scientific 
claim is written in a language that is similar to the 
language of journal p apers. 
One important task that is slowly emerging is 
the extent to which the analysis of a patent doc u-
ment can be automated particularly to a ssess the 
overlap between the claims in the document about 
the article to be patented with that of related, rel e-
vant and even counter -claims about the article.  
The related and rel evant claims and counter claims 
may be found in existing patent documents and 
may, more in directly, exist in journal papers.  
A patent document has to make references to 
all other relevant/related articles that have been 
patented prior to the invention of the art icle, which 
is yet to be patented and is the object of the patent 
document.  The ref erences are made primarily by 
citing the name of the prior art patentees and the 
titles of their patent documents.  A patent doc u-
ment also has other linguistic descriptions of prior 
art; such descriptions are reminiscent of citations 
of journal papers in a  journal paper. The overlap of 
a new patent document with a set of existing patent 
documents may suggest the impact of extant 
knowledge in patent documents on emerging 
knowledge in the new patent document.  Such an 
overlap has been studied by the impact of  US 
semiconductor technology on the rest of the world 
(Appleyard and Kalsow: 1999): this overlap relies 
largely on the fr equency of citation of a US patent 
by the name of its author or the author?s place of 
work.  In computational linguistic (CL) terms thi s 
exercise relies on proper noun extra ction. 
The patent document relates to an explicit and 
exclusive right over an intellectual property.  A 
journal article relates to an implicit and i nclusive 
  
right over an intellectual property.  The overlap 
between these two forms of claims is crucial not 
only in ascertaining the rights of the patentee, or 
the abuse of the rights of others by the pa tentee, 
but also for monitoring the effectiveness of r e-
search based on a specialism as a whole or that of 
its component gro ups. 
The effect of one author or a group of authors 
working in an institution is indirectly mea sured by 
the so-called impact factor .  This factor relates to 
the frequency of citation of one or more journal 
papers written by an author or by a group.  The 
calculation of the impact fa ctor relies mainly on 
computing the frequency of the authors? name(s) 
within a corpus of journal articles.  Such an impact 
factor type calculation is used typically in bibl i-
ometrics (Garfield 1995).  Again, as in intra -patent 
impact studies mentioned above, in CL terms this 
is an exercise in proper noun identification and 
extraction. 
The analysis of a patent document, together 
with the analysis of the related corpora of other 
patent documents and intellectual property doc u-
ments, should be based on a framework which 
provides methods and tec hniques for analysing the 
contents of the document and of the corpora.  For 
us the source of a framework still lies in li nguistic 
and language studies.  Here we are pa rticularly 
interested in word formation and terminology u s-
age in highly specialised  disc iplines particularly 
those disciplines that deal with inta ngible articles 
coupling the word formation and terminology u s-
age with the citation patterns of proper nouns 
brings us closer to analysing the contents of a pat-
ent document and its siblings distributed over co r-
pora. 
Information scientists usually use the referen c-
ing data of research documents to analyse know l-
edge evolution in scientific fields as well as to 
identify the key authors, institutes , and journals in 
specific domains, using tools such as publication 
counts, citation analysis, co -citation analysis, and 
co-term analysis to do so.  In recent years, patent 
documents have gained considerable attention as a 
valuable resource that can be use d to analyse tec h-
nology advances using the same tools.  
Gupta and Pangannaya (2000) have applied 
bibliometric analysis to carbon nanotube patents to 
measure the growth of activity of carbon nan otube 
industries and their links with sc ience. They have 
also used patents data to study the country -wise 
distribution of patenting activity for the USA, J a-
pan, and other countries. Sector -wise performances 
of industry, academia and government, and the 
active players of carbon nanotubes were also stu d-
ied.  They describe the nature of inventions taking 
place in this particular field of technology, and the 
authors claim to have identified the emerging r e-
search directions, and the active companies and 
research groups involved.  
Meyer (2001) has used citation anal ysis 
and co-word analysis of patent documents and sc i-
entific literature to explore the interrel ationship 
between nano-science and nano -technology. Meyer 
investigated patent citation relations at the orga n-
izational levels along with geographical locations 
and affiliations of inventors and a uthors. The term 
co-occurrence  is used by Meyer to find the rel a-
tionship between the patent documents and the two 
scientific literature databases SCI and INSPEC. He 
has noticed that ??the terms that occur frequently 
in the document titles of all databases are related to 
[?] instrumentalities and/or are located in fields 
that are generally associated with substantial indu s-
trial research activity? (2001:177). Meyer has a r-
gued that ?Our data suggests that nano -technology 
and nano-science are essentially separate and he t-
erogeneous, yet interrelated cumulative stru ctures? 
(2001:164). 
 The study of word formation through n e-
ologisms within the special language of science 
and techno logy has led some authors to argue that 
it is the scientists as technologists who attempt to 
rationalise our experience of the world around us 
in written language by using new words or forms 
or by relexicalising the existing stock (see Ahmad 
2000 for relevant references).  Some lexicogr a-
phers (see for example Quirk et al 1985) have su g-
gested that neologisms can be formed by two 
processes:  First, the addition or combination of 
elements such as compounding: Resonant Tunne l-
ing Diodes  and Scanning tunneling microscopy  are 
examples for this type of neologism (compoundin g 
as a neologism formation is used extensively in 
science and technology literature); Second, the r e-
duction of elements into abbreviated forms. The 
abbreviations FET (Field E ffect Transistor) and 
MOSFET (Metallic Oxide Semiconductor FET) 
are examples of this type. 
Neologisms appear to signal the eme rgence of 
new concepts or artefacts and the frequency of this 
new word might indicate the scientific comm u-
  
nity?s acceptance of this new concept or artefact.  
Effenberger (1995) has argued that ?? the faster a 
subject field is developing, the more novelties are 
constructed, discovered or created. And these no v-
elties are talked and written about. In o rder to 
make this technical communication as efficient as 
possible, provision should be made for avoiding 
misunderstanding. One crucial point in this process 
is the vocabulary that is being used? (1995:131, 
emphasis added).  
In this paper we discuss the idiosyncratic la n-
guage used in patent documents.  The language is 
replete with terms and there are instances within a 
patent document that suggest that the authors not 
only use the specialist terms but use a local syntax 
as well.  We look specifically at the structure of the 
US Patents and suggest how with existing tec h-
niques used in information extraction and NLP, 
including term extraction and proper noun identif i-
cation, one can perform fairly complex tasks in 
patent analysis ? some of which are performed by 
patent experts by hand currently (Section 2).  This 
examination suggests to us a model of develo p-
ment in computer and  semi -conductor technology: 
an incremental model where each subsequent pa t-
ent helps in the development of ever -complex art i-
facts ? starting from devices onto circuits and onto 
systems.  We will look at one of the key i nventions 
in the field of semiconducto rs physics ? the elec-
tron tunneling device . These devices co mbine 
technical elegance, experimental complexity and 
manufacturing challenge.  Due to its strategic i m-
portance, a number of patents have been o btained 
by the US government and also by a nu mber of US 
and Japanese companies (Section 3).  Section 4 
concludes this paper.  
 
The Structure of US PTO Doc uments 
and a Local Grammar for the Docu-
ments 
The USPTO database is a representative sa mple of 
patent documents. The USPTO has documents r e-
lated to most bra nches of science and technology. 
It includes information about all US patent doc u-
ments since the first pa tent issued in 1970 to the 
most recent. The USPTO database a llows the user 
to search the full text of the patent documents for a 
certain word or a co mbination of words. It also 
provides a field search for specific information 
such as inventor or assignee . The search can also 
be conducted for a sp ecific year or range of years.  
The US Patents are written partly as a legal text 
and partly as a scientific d ocument.  Over the last 
50 years or so, it appears that US Patent doc uments 
have been structured in terms of layout and have a 
superficial resemblance to Marvin Minsky?s 
frame-like knowledge represe ntation schema.   
The patent document can be divided into 
three main parts for the present discussion: The 
first part  comprises the biographical details of the 
inventors (and their employers) together with the 
title of the invention and a brief free -text abstract, 
dates when the patent was applied for and when 
the patent was granted and so on.  The free text is 
essentially a summary of the claims of the pa t-
entee; The second part  contains external refe rences 
of three sorts: the first sort is the specialist domain 
of the invention ? the subject class indica ting the 
super-ordinate class and instances; the se cond sort 
are other cited patents organised as a 4 -tuple: (i) 
patent number, (ii) date of approval, (iii) first i n-
ventor and (iv) classification number; and, the third 
sort is a bibliographic reference to public ations that 
may have contributed to the pa tent;  The third part 
of a current US Patent document co mprises 
?claims? related to the patent and the d escription of 
the ?invention? (there are diagrams of the inve ntion 
attached to the document and the diagrams d e-
scribed in the text). Table 1 on the next page shows 
the template of the current (c. 1980 and a fter) 
USPTO?s. 
The ?claims? of the patentees are clearly 
itemised and initialised by the number of the claim; 
the first claim is the basis of the patent abstract 
generally.  The ?background to the invention? is 
written in an idiosyncratic fashion as well ? the 
invention is first contextualised in a broader group 
of other inventions to date and then the specific 
nature of the invention is e xemplified.  The 
broader and the specific are usually marked by 
phrases like ?The (present) invention relates to? 
and the specificity is phrased as ?(more) specif i-
cally.? or ?(more) pa rticularly?.  These phrases are 
followed by one or more noun phrases connected 
with, for example, c onjunctions or qualifiers.  The 
first noun phrase names the article i nvented, for 
instance, a name of a new device, circuit or a fabr i-
cating or testing pro cess.

The NP comprises d eterminers and modal verbs 
together with (compound) nouns.  The first NP is 
optionally followed by a qualification that restricts 
or extends the scope of the disco very ? the 
enlargement or restriction is named and another 
NP is used for the naming and so on.  This simple 
grammar can be verified by exa mining a corpus of 
patent documents.  To illu strate this point we have 
looked at a recent randomly selected patent on 
memory devices  ? a patent filed by Kabushiki Ka i-
sha Toshiba  of Japan (or Toshiba for short), and 
approved by USPTO on 20 th May 2003, on a sem i-
conductor memory device which uses the emergent 
notion of memory cells (a memory cell is  a tiny 
area within the memory array tha t actually stores 
the bit in the form of an electrical charge 1).  An 
analysis of the title and that of the ?Background of 
the Invention: Field of I nvention? fields shows the 
use of this restricted syntax (Table 2).  In much the 
                                                           
1 Definition form http://rel.intersil.com/docs/lexicon/M.html , site 
visited 29 May 2003) 
same as the ?claims? and ?th e ?background?, the 
?summary of the invention? is also phrased in a 
formulaic manner (see Table 1 for the structure of 
the patent document).  
The analysis of the other slots governed by 
a simpler grammar yields interesting results and 
suggests that the name s of assignees and the ma n-
ner in which patents are being cited can be easily 
inter-related (Table 3).  Toshiba?s USPTO 
6567330 refers to 8 other patents.  The details of 
the referenced patents are in a 4 -tuple, which can 
be unambiguously interpreted.  Each  of the refe r-
enced patents refers to about 10 patents in turn.  
An examination of 82 such patents may help to 
initiate, perhaps, a discussion of the ?invention life 
cycle? or ?licensing potential of a patent? (Mogee 
1997), or even a discussion of ?micro fo undations 
of innovation systems? (Ande rsen 2000).

A finer grained analysis to show which 
?country? is more influentia l can also be performed 
fairly readily and indicates the extent to which pa t-
ents that are held by assignees domiciled in the 
USA have over half the cited patents (Table 4).

Table 4: An analysis of USPTO No. 6567330 (T o-
shiba Japan) shows the major influence of US -
based assignees, followed by Japan.  A significant 
number of patents  (8.5%) are held by individuals 
and not assigned specif ically to a country.  
 
A semi-automatic analysis of terms used in 
the Abstracts and Titles of the patents (Toshiba 
6567330 and patents referenced in the Toshiba 
patents) shows the co -citation pattern o f terms.  
This may help in the clu stering of patents on the 
basis of terms extracted from the patent doc uments 
as well as novel terms (terms not included in the 
USPTO Patent Class ification terminology data 
base) found in the doc ument.  We show the co -
citation of the two key terms memory cell  and 
memory device in the nine patents discussed above.  
The use of the two terms individually and as roots 
and stems of other compounds is also shown.  The 
more frequent citation is to the newer term memory 
cell and it is cited in all but one of the 9 related 
patents.  The related memory devices ? newer de-
vices now incorporate memory cells ? is less fre-
quently used and it is only found in the abstracts of 
5 out of the 9 patents.  Both terms are co -cited in 6 
out of the 9  patents (see Table 5 for details).   
The interrelationship between the different 
patents can be explored further by examining 
closely as to what is being patented within the pa t-
ent and what is being patented in the referenced 
patents.  Again, we use the e xample of the Toshiba 
patent No. 6567330 which refers to 8 other patents.  
The patent itself relates to the invention of a sys-
tem.  The referred patents relate to other systems 
and circuits.  Let us look at the earliest patent cited 
in Toshiba?s patent: th is is US PTO No. 5386388 
filed by Intel Corporation (USA) approved in 
January 1995.  The title of I ntel?s patent is ? Single 
cell reference scheme for flash memory sensing 
and program state verific ation?.  Flash memory is 
defined as ?A nonvolatile programma ble semicon-
ductor memory product  2.  This patent r elates to the 
invention of a circuit.  Intel?s patent comprises re f-
erences to another 15 patents: 5 refer to other sy s-
tems, 8 to ci rcuits, and one each to a device and a 
software program (see Figure 1 on th e next page).  
The information whether a patent is r elated to any 
of the four classes can be gleaned from the Patent 
Classification Number.  Further analysis of the 
referenced patents shows a similar pattern ? refe r-
ences to circuits, devices, systems and s oftware.  
This appears to be a basis of the inventions within 
the semiconductor industry, especially those r e-
lated to the development of co mputer systems 
based on these systems, d evices and circuits.  This 
is the basis of our more speculative investig ations 
related to the resonant tunneling systems.

3 The Evolution of the Resonant 
Tunneling Devices  
We will now focus on how terminology u sage may 
help in tracking the evolution of resonant tunne l-
ing devices.  These are ultra high -speed devices, 
which perhaps will be used in the compute rs of the 
next decade or so.  In order to study how one can 
track technology progress we have adopted an i n-
tuitive, but realistic, framework. For us, all co m-
plex systems comprise subsystems and subsystems 
are made up of much smaller (and simpler) de-
vices.  A computer system is made up of i ntegrated 
circuits and the circuits made up of transistors and 
transistors come in di fferent types. One model of 
growth can be thought of as follows: First, devices 
are patented, then su bsystems, and finally the 
complex systems (remember only tangible articles 
can be patented). So fo llowing this intuitive 
framework we will first see a number of devices 
being patented then subsystems and finally the sy s-
tems themselves.  Tunnel diodes are supposed to 
empower faster switching devices, which in turn 
have to be incorporated into subsystems with tu n-
neling transistors and into complex systems with 
circuits.  Our hypothesis is that an analysis of a 
diachronically organized text corpus will show the 
working of the above -mentioned framework. 
A corpus was built containing more than 
2.2 million words of patent documents.  The co r-
pus contains all patent documents that co ntain the 
term tunneling  in the title. USPTO search r esults 
showed that there are 372 titles, approved from 
1975 to 1999 in semiconductor physics.  We have 
analysed frequency of compound word in the 
USPTO patent documents published b etween 
1975-1999 (Table 6).

The compound word analysis was co n-
ducted using System Quirk and no compounds 
were pre spec ified (System Quirk a text analysis 
system, is avai lable on 
www.computing.surrey.ac.uk/ai/SystemQ ). The 
system extracts compound words based on a si m-
ple heuristic: a set of word that does not co ntain 
closed class words (i.e. determiners, conjun ctions, 
prepositions, and moderators) or the orthographic 
signs (including pun ctuation, numbers, currency 
and other symbols) is considered by Sy stem Quirk 
to be a compound word (see Ahmad and Rogers, 
2001, for details). The va lidation of compound 
words can also be carried out by statistical tests, 
for instance described by Smajda (1994).  
To investigate the progress of resonant 
tunneling devices and circuits, the multi -word 
terms were extracted from the USPTO full text 
corpus using System Quirk. The extracted terms 
that relate to resonant tu nneling diodes, resonant 
tunneling transistors and resonant tunneling ci r-
cuits were arranged in a five year interval starting 
from the first emergence of the term resonant tun-
neling in USPTO abstract documents in 1985.   
Tracking the frequency usage of the terms 
associated with resonant tunneling artefacts in the 
USPTO full text corpus shows a considerable i n-
  
crease of frequency usage i nterval by interval.  The 
frequency of the term resonant tunneling diode 
(and its plural form resonant tunneling diode s, 
both denoted as the lemma resonant tunneling d i-
ode~ subsequently) increased significantly from 45 
in 1985-1989 to 446 in 1990 -1994  by about a fa c-
tor of 19 and then in the next time interval 1995 -
1999 the frequency dropped by about half to 240. 
The frequency usage of the term resonant tunne l-
ing transistor~  in the USPTO full text corpus i n-
creased from 23 in the p eriod 1985-1989 by about 
a factor of 10 to 225 in 1990 -1994. The increase of 
frequency usage of the term in the time period 
1995-1999 increased by a factor of 1.3 to become 
293. The term resonant tunne ling circuit~ appears 
in the USPTO full text co rpus 45 times in the time 
interval 1990 -1994. Frequency usage of resonant 
tunneling circuits inc reased by a fa ctor of 1.3 in the 
next interval (1995 -1999) to 57.  
Word formation is not restricted to the i n-
flection of a compound word. Rather, we see fu r-
ther instances of compounding where an existing 
compound, say, resonant tunneling d i-
ode/transistor  is  used as a head of other co m-
pounds (Table 7).

We note the very productive use of compoun ding 
and inflection in our corpus.  Note, ho wever, that 
the size of the corpus for the three differe nt peri-
ods, 1985 -89, 90-94 and 95-99, are different: 
378272, 771525 and 995894 respectively.  The 
size of the corpus perhaps for the later two p eriods 
is roughly the same but the earlier corpus (85 -89) 
is three times smaller.  In order to pr esent a better 
comparison we will look at the relative frequency 
of the compounds in that we will sum up the fr e-
quency of all the extracted compounds related to 
resonant tunneling diodes, transistors and circuits, 
as per our intuitive fram ework, and assign relative 
frequency to each of the three relative to the sum.  
Consider the result of analysis of 133 texts 
of patents published in 1990 -1994 for tunnel diode 
related patents.  The total number of terms co m-
prising the lemma resonant tunneling diode~ is 
490, which includes  the lemma on its own and two 
terms containing the lemma as the headword; these 
are multiple peak resonant tunne ling diode, barrier 
resonant tunneling d iode.  The total containing the 
lemma resonant tunneling transistor  is 225, which 
is made up of 188 for the lemma on its own and the 
rest for the two other terms.  The lemma RT circuit  
also includes hyponyms of the term, e.g. RT oscil-
lator (circuit), RT  logic gate (circuit)  and RT mem-
ory (circuit) ; note that the term circuit is shown in 
parentheses as it is ellipsed in the text ? the reader 
of the patents, an expert in the disc ipline, is 
expected to know that an oscillator is a circuit.  
The two terms occur 24 and 12 times t ogether with 
4 other terms that collectively occur 9 times ma k-
ing a total of 45.  The three lemmas RT diode, 
transistor and circuit occur for a total of 490 + 225 
+ 45 (= 760) times, hence the relative fr equency of 
the three lemmas is 64.4% (490/760), 29.6% 
(225/760) and 6% (45/760) respectively (Table 8 
shows a brea kdown of the distributio n). 
This relative frequency computation was 
conducted over the periods 1985 -1989 and 1995 -
1999.  Table 9 (on the next page) shows that over 
64% of the terms belong to the lemma resonant 
tunneling diode ~, about 30 % to resonant tunne ling 
transistor and just about 6% to  resonant tu nneling 
circuit ~.  This situatio n changes quite dramatically 
in the next quinquennium (1995-1999).

4 Afterword 
It appears that there is a local grammar , compris-
ing vocabulary of t he specialist domain and a sy n-
tax that appears different from the general 
(universal?) syntax, used in framing the claims, 
background and su mmary of the invention in a US 
Patent document.  A number of slots in the US 
PTO document are reserved for proper na mes ? 
patentees, assignees, places of work, and other 
slots hold dates and all these slots show the e x-
tremes of the local grammar ? essentially a gra m-
mar for a one-word language.  The document 
comprises ?references to (other patents) and also 
citations to an extant by other later patents ? this 
information is encoded in another local grammar 
of one or more 4 -tuples referring to a referenced 
patent ? the 4-tuple has a clearly defined s equence 
and allows expressions only in terms of four noun -
phrases.  The referenced patent number is an active 
hyperlink through which the details of the refe r-
enced patent can be a ccessed and subsequently a 
chain of references can be established in a (semi -) 
automatic manner.  The existence of a local gra m-
mar and the hyperlinks s uggests to us that one can 
create a historic (diachronic) description of an 
invention together with the crucial account of the 
influence of other inventions.   
Restricted syntax is used, for example, in 
describing time (hours, minutes, seconds, days, 
years, months), in financial news wire as well as 
mission-critical communication.  The sp ecialist 
vocabulary, and more so the productive use of the 
vocabulary (see below for details), as well as the 
restricted syntax emerges initially for assuring a m-
biguity-free communication in an inherent noisy 
medium of communication ? natural language.   
Complementary to the emergence of the 
present US patent document, there has been an a c-
cumulation of terminological knowledge in terms 
of the repositories usually referred to  as patent 
classification .  The Patent Offices around the 
world classify all manners of ?art icles? ranging 
from micro -electronics to kitchen utensils and from 
software systems to heavy excavation machinery, 
for example.  Much like a number of other utilita r-
ian class ification systems, including the Dewey 
Decimal Classification on the one hand and the US 
National Library of Medicine?s Disease Classific a-
tion system on the other, the US PTO classification 
system is detailed, complex, full of cross refe r-
ences, and occasionally confusing.  The fact r e-
mains, however, that like all utilita rian systems, the 
US PTO classification system is a rich repository 
that can be used, with some alterations, as the lex i-
cal/terminological resource for information extra c-
tion in particular and NLP in general.  The 
repository states the ontological commitment of the 
US PTO and its advisers, and can be used for 
building knowledge representation schema or s e-
mantic processing sy stems. 
The appearance of a local grammar, or 
perhaps local grammars, used to frame a patent 
document together with an extensive terminology 
database of patent class ification, is good news for 
the patent processing comm unity.  There is some 
hope that the information extraction and NLP sy s-
tems will be able to extrac t the terminology and 
identify the idiosyncratic syntax that governs the 
  
different parts of the patent document with the help 
of techniques pioneered in corpus linguistics.  
Terminology extraction can be facilitated by refe r-
ring to the patent classific ation terminology base 
and facilitated by various statistical and linguisti c 
techniques used to identify complex noun -phrases 
in specialist texts.  Once the local grammar is ide n-
tified it will be able to meaningfully process the 
documents for inferring the imp ort of a given i n-
vention in relation to other inventions and to assess 
the impact of journal publications of inventions.  
And, indeed all manner of new ways of examining 
a patent document may open up once the investig a-
tor overcomes the burden of sifting th rough an 
overgrowing lexical mountain of new patents, rev i-
sions to exis ting patents and the scientific and 
technical publication juggernaut that adds more to 
the mountain on almost daily basis.  The aut omatic 
extraction of compounds from a corpus of patent  
documents appears to show the introduction of 
new artifacts through the use of morphological 
processes like word formations.  Cu rrently, our 
work in progress is to ?chart? a transfer of such 
terms in journal papers onto patents, in a ddition to 
the exercise reported which charts the transfer of 
terms within a diachronically organised corpus of 
patent documents.
