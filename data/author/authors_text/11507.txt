Abstract 
 
This article is concerned with Extreme Case 
Formulations (ECFs) (Edwards, 2000; 
Pomerantz, 1986) in spontaneous Cypriot 
Greek conversations.1 This study confirms 
the occurrence of ECFs in complaints as 
identified by Edwards (2000) Pomerantz 
(1986), but goes one step further to analyse 
the sequential and interaction work 
accomplished with ECFs in reporting 
?opposition-type stories? (Schegloff, 1984) 
and in complaining about a non-present 
party?s misbehaviour. Opposition-type 
stories report the oppositional conversation 
of the teller with a third non-present party 
(id.). Interestingly, in the conversational 
extracts examined in this study, the 
conversation reported is culminated with the 
opponent?s reported extreme claim (ECF) 
occupying the last turn. The occurrence of an 
ECF at that marked place, that is, at the 
punchline of the telling, is associated with 
issues of affiliation and stance since it is 
placed exactly before the recipient?s slot 
upon story completion, which is a regular 
place for the occurrence of evaluation 
(Schegloff, 1984). 
 
 
1 Introduction

 Cyprus is an independent island republic in the 
Eastern Mediterranean. Data from the 2001 census of 
population showed that on 1st October 2001 the total 
population of the Cyprus Republic was 689,565 
composed of 89.7% Greek Cypriots, 0.2% Armenian, 
0.5% Maronites, 0.04% Cypriots of European origin 
called ?Latins? and 0.05% Turkish Cypriots; 0.1% 
did not declare their ethnic religious group (Census of 
Population 2001); the remainder being foreigners 
from Europe and Asia. The Greek speech community 
in Cyprus is defined as diglossic. Diglossia in Cyprus 
refers to the simultaneous use of the dialect (Cypriot 
Greek dialect, CD) and the demotic Greek (Modern 
Greek, MG). 
 
 
 
 
 
This article reports some of the findings of a 
study of extreme case formulations (ECFs) 
(Edwards, 2000; Pomerantz, 1986) in 
spontaneous conversations exclusively 
conducted in Cypriot Greek.  
 
In a seminal article, Pomerantz (1986) drew 
attention to the conversational uses of extreme 
case formulations (ECFs). Edwards (2000: 347-
8) explains that ECFs are ?descriptions or 
assessments that deploy extreme expressions 
such as every, all, none, best, least, as good as it 
gets, always, perfectly, brand new, and 
absolutely?. Pomerantz (1986: 219-220) 
summarizes the three main uses of ECFs, mainly 
used in complaints, in the following way: 
 
(1) to assert the strongest case in  
  anticipation of non-sympathetic     
      hearings, 
(2) to propose the cause of a phenomenon, 
(3) to speak for the rightness (wrongness) of  
     a practice. 
 
Pomerantz?s (1986) three uses of ECFs are 
basically oppositional and argumentative, 
occurring in environments where descriptions 
and assessments are being strengthened or 
resisted. As Edwards (2000) showed this applies 
to his counselling data (1995) too, where wife 
and husband produce and defend opposed 
versions of facts. In this data a lot of ECFs 
follow the same sequential pattern of ?ECF-
challenge-softener?. Although Pomerantz (1986) 
did not pursue post-ECF talk, she noted the 
challenge after an ECF.  
 
However, as Edwards notes (2000: 360), ECFs 
can also occur in affiliative sequences as 
?upgrades and displays of affiliation being done, 
of agreement being full and so on? ?as in 
Pomerantz?s (1984) demonstration of how 
1
upgraded ?second assessments? display 
agreement. ECFs make excellent upgrades (id.). 
Added to this role, ECFs might be treated by 
participants as ?indexing the speaker?s stance or 
attitude?, what Edwards calls ?investments? 
(op.cit.: 363-4). As Edwards explains (id.) 
denying or insisting on something in an extreme 
way can highlight the action of denying or 
insisting, as a kind of stance or attitude (cf. 
Edwards & Potter, 1992; Potter 1996). Finally, 
Edwards (2000: 365) draws attention to the 
?nonliteral or metaphoric uses of ECFs? used in 
actions of exaggerating, teasing, ironizing, 
emphasizing, joking etc. 
 
2 Data and Methodology 
 
The study of ECFs investigated in this work is 
based on recordings of informal, spontaneous, 
face-to-face conversations among close friends 
or relatives. These are exclusively conducted in 
Cypriot Greek. The conversations transcribed for 
the present study are part of a collection of 
recordings that took place between December 
1998 and April 2003. They comprise 
transcriptions of 35 hours of tape-recorded 
natural interactions produced by young native 
Cypriot Greek speakers during a variety of 
gatherings or occasions, e.g. dinner, gathering 
for coffee in friends? houses etc. The extracts 
included in this article comprise transcriptions of 
approximately 3 hour. The recordings consist of 
same sex conversations among women.2 
 
The method that is adopted in the analysis of the 
data is Conversation Analysis (CA), which has 
its origins in the pioneering work in the sixties 
by the sociologist Harvey Sacks (1992a, 1992b).  
 
First and foremost, conversation analysis has 
focused its analytical attention on ?recorded, 
naturally occurring talk-in-interaction? (Hutchby 
and Wooffitt, 1998: 14). These recordings of 
actual speech are transcribed using a system 
which is intended to capture in detail the 
characteristics ?of the sequencing of turns, 
including gaps, pauses and overlaps; and the 
                                                 
2
 ECFs were also identified in a set of data collected 
during 2007 in conversations among young men. The 
transcription revealed use of ECFs as upgraded 
assessments and in actions of joking and 
exaggerating. Interestingly, no use of ECF in 
complaints was found. 
 
element of speech delivery such as audible 
breath and laughter, stress, enunciation, 
intonation and pitch? (Hutchby and Drew, 1995: 
182).  
 
The transcription symbols used in this study are 
based on the transcription conventions 
developed by Jefferson for the analysis of 
conversational turns in English conversation (see 
Sacks, Schegloff and Jefferson, 1974) and are 
adopted in the form presented by Ochs, 
Schegloff and Thompson (1996) and Clift 
(1999). The relevant transcription symbols for 
this study are cited in appendix I. 
 
The phonetic inventory used for reading 
transcription is based on the International 
Phonetic Association [IPA] which is adjusted to 
the Greek language by Nespor (1999) and on the 
phonetic inventory of Cypriot Greek presented 
and described by Newton (1972).  
 
3 ECFs in Cypriot Greek 
  
My data of spontaneous Cypriot-Greek 
conversations confirms Edwards?s (2000) and 
Pomerantz?s claim (1986) of the use of ECFs in 
making complaints.   
 
In particular, this study reports a pattern of the 
sequential and interactional position of ECFs 
found in the reporting of ?opposition-type 
stories? (Schegloff, 1984) and in complaining 
about a non-present party?s misbehaviour. In the 
conversations examined here, complaining is 
expressed with the narration of two-party 
opposition-type stories in which the teller is one 
of the two parties involved. In particular, 
opposition-type stories are reported using the 
BCBC format, B being the teller and C his/her 
opponent. Thus, that BCBC format tracks not 
only the alternation of the turns but also the 
alternation of positions. This formula turns out to 
have C?s position be the one occupying the last 
turn (Schegloff, 1984). By ?reproducing the 
?original? utterance or utterances, speakers can 
provide access to the interaction being discussed, 
enabling the recipient to assess it for himself. 
Supplying this kind of evidence is important 
when?..a complaint is made about someone 
based on what they said? (Holt, 1996: 229).  
 
It seems that the basic feature attributed to 
opposition type stories is that they are more 
than any other form of storytelling ?recipient 
2
designed? (Sacks, 1971: 453). If this is so, it 
means that tellers design the storytelling with 
an orientation to the specific recipients in order 
to elicit their affiliative siding. In the fragments 
under study where the teller is one of the 
opposing parties, it is obviously important for 
the teller to transmit to her recipients the 
correctness or appropriateness of her position 
and the incorrectness or inappropriateness of 
her opponent?s position. In these extracts the 
teller invests special effort in constructing the 
contrast between herself and her opponent in 
two interrelated ways. Therefore, this is 
accomplished by narrating an opposition-type 
story based on the conversation she had with 
the opponent and by reporting the activities of 
the opponent parties which proposes the 
significance of the upcoming reported speech. 
Each story culminates in a report of the other?s 
speech. The motivation for the reporting of 
speech and activities is grounded in 
considerations of affiliation and stance. 
 
Actually in the conversations examined in this 
paper the oppositional story has its punchline in 
the reporting of an ECF attributed to the third 
non-present party. One thing the recipient can do 
is to side with one or the other, that is, 
teller/protagonist or his/her opponent. Usually 
recipients side with tellers because this is how 
tellers choose their story recipients (Schegloff, 
1984). In the cases here the reported ECF is 
responded to with a challenge taking the form of 
rhetorical question, extreme case formulation, 
idiomatic expression or ironic evaluation. Stories 
involve extended single turns at talk (Sacks, 
1968: 18). The storytelling sequence is 
composed ?of three serially ordered and 
adjacently placed types of sequences?: ?the 
preface, the telling, and the response sequences? 
(Sacks, 1974: My main interest is in the 
punchline and the recipient?s slot upon story 
completion. 
 
Due to the limit of space, I present only two 
representative examples of the use ECF in 
the punchline of opposition-type stories as 
shown in the extract 1 and 2 that follow.

In extract 1 above the complaining proceeds as 
follows: the teller is reporting the complainable 
behavior of her opponent through reporting her 
transgressions (1: 9-10, 12-13, 15-16) and then 
continues with the reporting of the oppositional 
exchange (1: 20, 25-33) between her and her 
opponent which follows the BCBC format. 
The oppositional exchange culminates in a 
piece of formulaic-sounding wisdom proffered 
by the mother (1: 32-33: ?only when you 
become a mother will you understand?) which 
is hearable as an ?extra-ordinary? claim 
(Pomerantz, 1986) framed as such based on the 
use of the ECF ?only? followed with the 
idiomatic expression ?when you become a 
mother will you understand?. According to

 Mamas is a Cypriot journalist. 
Torode, ?an extreme case is designed to close 
an argument. As such it is vulnerable to 
attempts at refutation? (1996: 10). Thus, the 
placement of that extraordinary claim at the 
climax of the story should be seen in relation 
to motivations of eliciting affiliation. In other 
words the teller offers to the recipient an 
extreme claim in order to elicit a refutation of 
that claim. The reporting of the opponent?s 
words effected by intonation, as it is shown in 
the stress in voice and the louder tone, serves 
to detach the teller from commitment with 
these words. In 1: 34 the recipient challenges 
the mother?s exaggerative claim with a 
rhetorical question ?oh rea::lly??. In agreement 
with Schegloff?s claim, the suggested response 
gets heard as a slot in the oppositional 
conversation reported by the teller because it 
comes off ?as a proposed piece? of the teller?s 
argument (1984: 46-47). The shift of footing 
(Goffman, 1979) from the mother?s reported 
extreme claim to the rhetorical question frames 
(Goffman, 1974) the evaluation as irony.  
 
The following extract also serves to illustrate 
the point shown with extract 1 about the 
occurrence of ECF at the climax of an 
oppositional story.

In extract (2) the teller announces that the 
complaint is about something the other (Lina) 
said to her (2: 1-2) and starts reporting the 
other?s words (2: 5-7), but restarts by reporting 
the ?opposition? type story from an earlier 
point (2: 7-12).  
 
This inserted oppositional story is hearable as 
background information essential for the 
recipients? appreciation of the punchline. The 
punchline, that is, the opponent?s words that 
she started reporting in 2: 5-7, but were left 
unreported, are repeated and completed in 2: 
16-18. In this story the teller presents the 
oppositional conversation in a BCBC format 
where B is the teller and C the opponent, that 
is, Lina. The opponent is reported as making 
the questions and the teller as responding to 
them. The reported questions are presented as 
aggressive and challenging of the responses 
given by the teller (2: 9-10, ?are you serious? 
he gets such a salary and he?ll quit??). With the 
reported assessment of 2: 19-22, Lina is 
presented as expressing her overt disapproval 
of Panos?s claims which are also adapted by 
Christiana. This is achieved with her reported 
exaggerated claim that even if she was asked to 
do copying she would do it for the money. This 
becomes even more extreme because it is 
accompanied with an ?extreme case 
formulation? (?all day?). This is a strong 
criticism of the teller and her friend?s beliefs. 
Christiana is complaining about her making 
such a strong criticism of their beliefs. The 
mimicked exaggeration in reproducing the 
opponent?s words effected with stretch and 
emphasis clearly detaches the teller from their 
inside meaning. 
 
 The reported claim is responded to with a 
rhetorical question by one of the recipients (2: 
24-25). This question is hearable as a slot in 
the oppositional conversation reported by the 
teller because it comes off as a piece of the 
complainant?s argument. With that she 
challenges the opponent?s claim by bringing it 
into question. The repetition of the extreme 
case formulation ?all day? is employed to 
challenge the extreme claim of the opponent. 
This question is framed as an ironic challenge 
based on the impossibility of what is being 
asked ?well >what did she get a master?s for, 
to make copies all day?<? reinforced with the 
?extreme case? ?all day??. This question 
serves as an ironic challenge on another level 
too, that of the shared knowledge that Lina is 
very proud of having a master?s degree so her 
claim is not true. Hence, with this question the 
recipient claims disbelief of the opponent?s 
assessment. In addition, this question serves as 
an ?impossible description? (Torode, 1996).

As was mentioned above ECFs do not only 
occur in reporting and responding to 
opposition-type stories, but also in 
complaining about a non-present party?s 
misbehavior in general. Extract 3 that follows 
is a representative example of that case.

 As was mentioned above in complaints it is 
important for the teller to establish his/her 
recipients? affiliation. In my data, where the 
teller is complaining about another, this is 
usually achieved with extreme and hyperbolic 
descriptions of the other?s misbehaviour.  
 
Thus, in 3: 1-3 the teller introduces a 
complaint about a non-present party?s 
misbehaviour by soliciting a ?reminiscence 
recognition? from E, the knowing recipient 
(cf. Lerner, 1992: 255) about the principal 
character?s (cf. Goodwin, 1984) behaviour. By 
characterizing Andie?s behaviour as a 
?syndrome?, the teller (3: 3) foreshows a 
negative telling/criticism of Andie and 
establishes her stance towards the upcoming 
telling. In addition, through the reminiscence 
recognition solicit she invites the knowing 
recipient to confirm what it assesses and 
express a similar stance. Since the addressed 
recipient withholds a response, the teller 
through an extreme description (3: 5-6) 
identified as such by the ECF ?every time? 
employs a second solicit of reminiscence 
recognition (3: 5) addressed to E, the knowing 
recipient. E (3: 6) responds negatively to the 
solicit and this is in disagreement with the 
expectations of the solicit. The teller initiates a 
third solicit of reminiscence recognition (3: 8-
10) and finally receives recognition by the 
knowing recipient (3: 14-15). The ECF ?every 
time? is repeated by the teller (3:18-20) in a 
last attempt to receive recognition. The 
addressed recipient with a ?candidate 
understanding? (Wilkinson and Kitzinger, 
2006) in the form of a question (3: 21) reveals 
recognition of the connection between the 
information given in the preface and the topic 
of the upcoming telling, that is, what the story 
is about and asks about it directly, ?so? (.)  did 
she do that last ni::ght too??.  
 
The telling (3: 22-23) is designed as a surprise 
source as shown by the fact that it responds to 
a yes/no question (3: 21) with a detailed 
description of the third person?s misconduct 
and the placement of the address form 
?guy::s? in turn final position. The telling is 
responded to by the recipient (3: 24) with an 
assertion of ?ritualized disbelief? (Heritage, 
1984: 339) which treats the prior utterance as 
news (Wilkinson and Kitzinger, 2006). The 
teller in each of her turns (22-23, 27, 29-31, 
33, 35, 37) adds another increment which 
forms part of the exaggerated description of 
the transgression of the principal character?s 
behaviour. The description of the other?s 
transgression has its climax in 3: 37. 
 
The recipients, that is, M (3: 38), A (3: 39) and 
P (3: 40-41) make an evaluation upon the 
story-completion one after the other. Thus M 
(3: 38) and A (3: 39) both display ?assertions 
of ritualized disbelief?. 4 P (3: 40-41), produces 
a rhetorical question, identified as such 
because it does not expect a response since it 
brings into question a common knowledge. It 
is framed as ironic evaluation, based on the 
fact that is not sequentially linked to the 
previous talk. In addition, the extreme ECF 
?all her time? adds to the ironic hearing. The 
ironic evaluation conveyed is also recognized 
based on the shared knowledge that Andie is 
visiting a priest often and consults with him. 
Hence, with this assertion P (3: 40-41) offers 
another argument for Andie?s behaviour being 
reprehensible by ironically evaluating her 
incompatible actions. Her behaviour as 
described by the teller contradicts the fact that 
she is known to spend a great deal of time with 
the priest. 
  
4 Conclusion 
In this paper I investigated one aspect of the 
interactional and sequential work 
accomplished with ECFs in complaining 
through a description of a non-present party?s 
misbehavior and in reporting opposition-type 
stories. Specifically, the focus was on 
complaints about the behaviour of a third non-
present party which develops with the 
reporting of two-party ?opposition type? 
exchanges in which the teller is one of the two 
parties involved (Schegloff, 1984). The 
contrasting positions are presented with the 
BCBC formula with the opponent?s position 
occupying the last turn. 
 
In exploring the sequential positioning of 
ECFs, I discovered that a regular place of their

 These items ?treat a prior utterance as news for 
recipient? (Heritage, 1984: 339), but according to 
Wilkinson and Kitzinger these kinds of assertions ?do 
more than this: they convey the speaker?s amazed 
incredulity and may also thus constitute a kind of 
surprise response in their own right? (2006: 34). 
7
occurrence in storytelling sequences is on the 
punchline of the story and more specifically on 
the culmination of the reporting of ?opposition 
type? conversation.  
 
The occurrence of ECFs at the end of the 
telling sequence seems to be associated with 
issues of affiliation that are sought from the 
recipients since the ?the story recipient?s slot 
after story completion? is a marked place for 
the occurrence of evaluations where the 
recipient is expected to side either with the 
teller or her opponent. (Schegloff, 1984: 44). 
Thus at this place the teller offers to the 
recipient something extreme to evaluate and 
challenge.  
 
In the extracts above recipients respond with 
evaluations expressed with rhetorical questions 
which consist of repetitions of ?extreme case 
formulation(s)? (Pomerantz, 1986) and  
?impossible description(s)? (Torode, 1996) of 
a third person?s overbuilt claim or words. 
 
To sum up extracts (1 & 2) examined in this 
paper revealed the following pattern: 
 
1. Opposition-type stories BCBC                 
2. Punchline: Reporting C?s ECF 
3. Recipient?s slot: Challenging the ECF 
{by non-literal means: rhetorical 
questions, ironic evaluations, 
impossible descriptions, repetitions of 
C?s ECF) 
 
Extract 3 revealed the following pattern 
 Teller:       Description of the other?s  
               misbehavior with ECFs.       
      Recipient: Evaluation with ECF 
 
To conclude with this study proves that the 
occurrence of ECF at the puncline is used to 
elicit the affiliation of the recipients, who 
express agreement/affiliation with the teller by 
challenging the ECF proffered by her 
opponent. This proves Sacks?s (1972: 341) 
observation that in some sequences certain 
activities have regular places of occurrence to 
such an extent that their absence is noticeable. 
This observation leads ?to a distinction 
between a ?slot? and the ?items? which fill it 
and to proposing that certain activities are 
accomplished by a combination between some 
item and some slot? (id.).
