Abstract
Wikipedia?s article contents and its cate-
gory hierarchy are widely used to produce
semantic resources which improve perfor-
mance on tasks like text classification and
keyword extraction. The reverse ? using
text classification methods for predicting
the categories of Wikipedia articles ? has
attracted less attention so far. We propose
to ?return the favor? and use text classi-
fiers to improve Wikipedia. This could
support the emergence of a virtuous circle
between the wisdom of the crowds and ma-
chine learning/NLP methods.
We define the categorization of Wikipedia
articles as a multi-label classification task,
describe two solutions to the task, and per-
form experiments that show that our ap-
proach is feasible despite the high number
of labels.
1 Introduction
Wikipedia?s article contents and its category hi-
erarchy are widely used to produce semantic re-
sources which improve performance on tasks like
text classification and keyword extraction (Baner-
jee, 2007; Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007;
Minier et al, 2007; Mihalcea and Csomai, 2007;
Wang and Domeniconi, 2008; Medelyan et al,
2008). The reverse ? using text classification
methods to improve Wikipedia?s article-category
mappings ? has attracted less attention (Fu et al,
2007).
A system that automatically suggests categories
for Wikipedia articles will help to improve the en-
cyclopedia for its users and authors, as well as the
semantic resources created from it.
The complexity of Wikipedia?s category sys-
tems
1
and sheer number of categories make it
1
We use the plural here, as each language version has its
hard for ? possibly inexperienced ? authors to as-
sign categories to new or existing articles. As of
February 2009, the German Wikipedia has about
886,000 articles, which belong to about 64,000
categories. For the English Wikipedia, those num-
bers are even higher.
2
Classical document classification data sets like
Reuters RCV1-V2 (Lewis et al, 2004) have
around 100 different categories. In comparison,
the automatic categorization of Wikipedia articles
is a challenging task, as it involves tens to hun-
dreds of thousand categories. For such large-scale
classification problems, particular attention is nec-
essary to deal with both training and prediction
complexity, as well as imbalanced class distribu-
tions.
In this article, we present the problem of
content-based article categorization in Wikipedia,
and suggest an evaluation protocol as well as two
content-based methods for solving this problem.
2 Problem Statement
Let X ? X be the set of all articles and L be
the set of all category labels in one of Wikipedia?s
language versions. Each article x ? X is assigned
a set of k(x) category labels {l
1
, . . . , l
k(x)
} ? L.
In this context, one can think of several pre-
diction problems: Given an article x without cat-
egory information, predict all the article?s cate-
gories. This scenario is typical for newly cre-
ated articles, thus we call it the new article prob-
lem. Another prediction task would be to predict
the missing categories for an article with existing,
but incomplete category information (missing cat-
egories problem). Such a condition can occur e.g.
if a new category is created and the creator of the
new category does not include all existing articles
that should be assigned to that category. In this pa-
own category hierarchy. The categories may be linked across
languages using so-called interlanguage links.

per, we will concentrate on the new article prob-
lem.
Such a problem is a so-called multi-label, or
any-of classification task, as opposed to single-
label (one-of ) classification (Manning et al,
2008). Multi-label classification can be expressed
as a set of binary classification problems:
f(x) = {l
i
|f
i
(x) = 1}, (1)
where f
i
: X ? {?1, 1}, 1 ? i ? |L| are indica-
tor functions for class l
i
, i.e. f
i
(x) = 1 iff. article
x is annotated with the category label l
i
.
The associated learning problem is to find a pre-
diction model
?
f that predicts categories for given
articles as good as possible, according to a given
loss function.
We choose micro- and macro-averaged F
1
as
loss functions. Micro-averaged F
1
is computed
from the complete confusion matrix, while macro-
averaged F
1
is the average F
1
computed from
class-wise confusion matrices. Micro-averaged
measures tend to measure the effectiveness of a
classifier on the large categories, while macro-
averaging gives more weight to smaller categories
(Manning et al, 2008).

is widely used in information retrieval and
supervised learning tasks. While providing a bal-
ance between precision and recall, optimizing for
F
1
?forces? the prediction method and the re-
spective learning algorithm to decide which cat-
egory labels to predict and which ones not ?
just predicting a ranking of labels is not suffi-
cient. This is motivated by the intended use of the
prediction method in a category suggestion sys-
tem for Wikipedia articles: Such a system can-
not present an arbitrarily high number of (possi-
bly ranked) suggestions to the user, who would be
overwhelmed by the amount of information. On
the other hand, if there is a fixed low number of
suggestions, there would be the danger of correct
category labels being left out.
3 Methods
There are many multi-label classification models
in the literature, which are either adaptions of ex-
isting single-label models, or models generated
by transformation of the multi-label problem to
single-label problems, which are then solved using
again existing single-label models. Tsoumakas et
al. (2009) give an overview of multi-label classifi-
cation methods.
Wikipedia articles are hypertext pages. For
classifying hypertext pages, there are two obvious
kinds of features: (i), there are content-based fea-
tures, like words or n-grams contained in the ar-
ticles, and (ii), there are link-based features, such
as in- and outgoing article links, links to external
web pages, and the (estimated or actually known)
categories of the linked articles. Past research on
relational learning and hypertext classification (Lu
and Getoor, 2003) has shown that both kinds of
features are useful, and that the strongest meth-
ods combine both. It makes sense to investigate
content-based features as well as link-based fea-
tures, because improvements in any of the two can
lead to overall improvements. The work presented
here focuses on content-based features.
A naive approach would be to directly take
the binary representation of multi-label classifica-
tion (equation 1), and then to train binary classi-
fier models like support-vector machines (SVM,
Cortes and Vapnik (1995)):
?
f
naive
(x) := {l
i
|
?
f
i
(x) = 1} (4)
As the training of a traditional binary SVM clas-
sifier does not optimize towards the given multi-
label loss function, but for accuracy, we do not ex-
pect the best results from this method.
33
If we want better multi-label predictions, chang-
ing the threshold of the binary decision functions
is a straightforward solution. We employed two
well-known thresholding strategies, ranking cut
(RCut) and score cut (SCut, Yang (2001)), to pre-
dict Wikipedia categories.
RCut sorts all labels according to their binary
prediction score
?
f
?
i
, and selects the t top labels:
?
f
rcut
(x) := argmax
t
1?i?|L|
?
f
?
i
(x), (5)
where argmax
t
a?A
g(a) refers to the t elements of
A with highest value g(a). The value of the hyper-
parameter threshold t can be chosen empirically
on a hold-out set.
SCut uses an individual decision threshold s
i
for each label:
?
f
scut
(x) := {l
i
|
?
f
?
i
(x) ? s
i
} (6)
Good threshold values s
i
can be determined dur-
ing training. Algorithm 1 shows a category-wise
optimization of the threshold values as described
by Yang (2001). Because it tunes the threshold s
i
for each category based on the F
1
measure over
that category, it optimizes for macro-averaged F
1
.
If we are able to find optimal thresholds for each
category, then we will achieve optimal macro-F
1
performance, as the following lemma says.
Lemma 1 Let
s
i
:= argmax
s?S
F
1
(X,Y
i
,
?
f
i
), (7)
?
f
i
(x) :=
{
1, if
?
f
?
i
(x) > s
?1, otherwise
(8)
Then
(s
1
, ..., s
|L|
) = argmax
(s
?
1
,...,s
?
|L|
)
F
macro
1
(X,Y,
?
f),
(9)
?
f(x) := {l
i
|
?
f
?
i
(x) > s
?
i
}) (10)
i.e., the component-wise binary F
1
optimization
yields the F
macro
1
-optimal multi-label threshold.
Proof: The components of the sum in the defi-
nition of macro-averaged F
1
(Equation 2) are ex-
actly the class-wise F
1
values. The choice of s
i
influences only the part of the sum
2?tp
i
2?tp
i
+fp
i
+fn
i
be-
longing to i. Thus each s
i
can be optimized inde-
pendently.
Representing each category label as binary pre-
diction problem, as in the work presented here,
requires |L| binary classifiers. There also exist
methods that use |L|
2
binary classifiers (Mencia
and F?urnkranz, 2008), which is not feasible if L is
large.

4 Experiments
To demonstrate the general feasibility of the au-
tomatic categorization of Wikipedia articles, we
conducted experiments on a subset of the German
Wikipedia. In this section, we describe the ex-
tracted data sets, the evaluation protocol, and dis-
cuss the results.
4.1 Category Data
To generate the data set for the experiment, we
used the official database dumps of the German
Wikipedia, generated December 6, 2008.
3
We
then extracted all articles belonging to the cate-
gory Eishockey (?ice-hockey?) or to one of its de-
scendants, and removed all category labels from
outside the chosen category sub-graph, and all cat-
egory labels of categories containing less than 5
articles. We proceeded identically for the category
Philosoph (?philosopher?).
Feature generation was performed as follows:
First, we removed all wiki markup from the article
source code. Second, we used Mallet (McCallum,
2002) to generate bag-of-words representations of
the articles. All tokens were converted to lower
case, and tokens occurring in only one article were
removed. We conducted no stopword removal, nor
stemming. Finally, we normalized the feature vec-
tors to sum up to one.
Table 2 shows some properties of the data. |X|
is the number of instances, |L| the number of dis-
tinct category labels; the fourth column contains
the number of features (words) in the data set.

Table 2: Data set properties.
4.2 Evaluation Protocol
Train-Test Split
For the experiment, we randomly separated the
data sets into 80% of the articles for training, and
20% for testing. To evaluate the new article prob-
lem, we removed all category labels from the arti-
cles in the test sets.
Training
As an experimental baseline, we used a static clas-
sifier (most-frequent) that always predicts the most
frequent categories, regardless of the article.
We implemented the RCut and SCut strate-
gies using linear support-vector machines from the
LIBSVM library (Chang and Lin, 2001) for the
underlying binary classification task. For each
category, we used 5-fold cross-validation to find
a good value for the hyperparameter C (Hsu et
al., 2003). As SVMs perform only binary deci-
sions, but do not yield scores suitable for ranking
the labels, we used LIBSVM?s modified version
of Platt?s method (Platt, 2000) to obtain probabil-
ities, which are used as scores for the RCut rank-
ings and the SCut decisions. As SCut?s threshold
search goes over an infinite set S = [0, 1] (Al-
gorithm 1, line 3), we did an approximate search
over this interval with step size 0.01. For RCut and
most-frequent, we report results for all thresholds
1, . . . , |L|. In an application setting, we would
have to determine a suitable t using a hold-out data
set.
4.3 Results and Discussion
The results can be seen in Table 3 and Figure
1 and 2. Both methods clearly perform better
than the baseline. For macro-averaged F
1
on
Eishockey, SCut performs better than RCut, which
is not surprising, as this method is optimized to-
wards macro-averaged F
1
. For Philosoph, RCut
with a rank threshold of t = 3 has a little bit (by
0.005) higher macro-averaged F
1
result, but this is
likely not a significant difference.
The experiments show that simple models like
the transformation from multi-label to binary
problems, combined with thresholding strategies
like SCut and RCut, are suitable for the categoriza-
tion of Wikipedia articles: The methods achieve a
good prediction quality, while the number of un-
derlying binary classifiers scales linearly (see Sec-
tion 3).
5 Conclusion and Future Work
In this article, we view the categorization of
Wikipedia articles as a multi-label classification
problem and report experiments on a subset of the
German Wikipedia. The experiments show that
there are suitable models for the categorization of
Wikipedia articles.
We propose to use machine learning algorithms
in order to improve the category assignments of
Wikipedia articles. While data from Wikipedia
is already widely used to improve text classifica-
tion systems, it may be desirable to ?return the fa-
vor? and use text classifiers to improve Wikipedia.
This could support the emergence of a virtuous cir-
cle between the wisdom of the crowds and ma-
chine ?intelligence?, i.e. machine learning and
NLP methods.
Wikipedia category data could be used as well
for generating publicly available, large-scale (hier-
archical) multi-label classification benchmark col-
lections with different characteristics. Further-
more, it could provide the basis for multilingual
document classification data sets.
To be able to provide category suggestions for
large Wikipedias like the German, the Spanish or
the English one, we will extend our experiments to
larger subsets, and finally to all of the German and
English Wikipedia. In order to achieve this, we
will also investigate hierarchical multi-label clas-
sification methods (Liu et al, 2005; Cai and Hof-
mann, 2004; Cesa-Bianchi et al, 2006) and faster
training algorithms for linear SVMs and logistic
regression (Fan et al, 2008; Shalev-Shwartz et al,
2007). Given that we use |L| binary classifiers for
our models, this should be feasible, even for large
numbers of categories. It would also be interest-
ing to compare our methods to the work by Fu et
al. (2007), which concentrates on link-based cate-
gorization of Wikipedia articles.
Other promising research directions are the ex-
amination of Wikipedia-specific features, and the
survey of large-scale multi-label classification al-
gorithms that take into account dependencies be-
tween labels.
