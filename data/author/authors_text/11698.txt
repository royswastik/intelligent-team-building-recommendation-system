Abstract 
The GREC-MSR task is to generate appropri-
ate references to an entity in the context of a 
piece of discourse longer than a sentence. In 
MSR ?09 run of this task, the main aim is to 
select the actual main subject reference 
(MSR) from a list of given referential expres-
sions that is appropriate in context. We used a 
machine learning approach augmented with 
some rules to select the most appropriate ref-
erential expression. Our approach uses the 
training set for learning and then combines 
some of the rules found by observation to im-
prove the system. 
1 Introduction 
In this paper we provide a description of our sys-
tem for the GREC MSR task of Generation Chal-
lenges 2009. GREC-2.0 Corpus of 2,000 
Wikipedia introduction sections in which refer-
ences to the main subject of the Wikipedia article 
have been annotated was provided to us by the or-
ganizers. The corpus was divided into five differ-
ent domains like cities, countries, mountains, 
people and rivers. 
The basic approach we used was to develop a 
baseline system first by training the system on the 
training set. This system then selects the most fre-
quent referential expression based on a number of 
parameters of the corresponding reference. After 
evaluation on the development set we used the de-
velopment set to deduce certain rules based on ob-
servation and iteratively added these rules to the 
system and evaluated resulting performance. Thus 
the system development can be divided into two 
phases which are discussed in sections 2 and 3. 
2 Baseline System: Training and Classifi-
cation 
The machine learning approach we used for the 
baseline system was domain independent and 
hence was build by populating a single database 
with the training set data. First we parsed the con-
tents of the XML files of the training sets using a 
Java DOM XML Parser. Then we inserted the 
training set data into the database named grec 
which had two tables: parsed_ref and possi-
ble_refex. There is a one to many mapping from 
possible_refex to parsed_ref. The possible_refex 
contains all possible REFEX elements i.e. referen-
tial expressions  possible while parsed_ref contains 
all the parsed references of the training set with 
attributes such as syncat, semcat, paragraph num-
ber, reference number (with respect to a para-
graph), sentence number and a foreign key refex id 
referring to the possible_refex table.  
The prediction of the referential expression was 
done based on features such as the semantic cate-
gory, syntactic category, paragraph number, refer-
ence number with respect to a paragraph and 
sentence number of the referent. One example 
from the database is, if the semcat of the reference 
is cities, syncat is np-subj, paragraph number is 2, 
ref number is 1 and sentence number equals 1 then 
in 74% of the cases of the training set the referen-
tial expression was with refex id=1 (i.e. 
type=common, emphatic=no, head=nominal and 
103
case= plain) and refex id = 4 (i.e. type=name, em-
phatic=no, head=nominal and case= plain)  had the 
second highest count (19.6%). Thus we selected 
the most frequent refex from the possible referen-
tial expressions corresponding to the feature set of 
the reference, based on their count in the training 
set populated database. These decision rules with 
their associated probabilities are stored in a table 
which served as our model for classification. When 
a number of referential expressions from the 
alt_refex match from the list of the given refexes 
then we select the refex with the longest surface 
form.  In certain case when the refex was not in the 
alt_refex element we select the second best case 
from our decision model. Results of this intermedi-
ate baseline system are given in Table 1.

3 Rule based Improvement 
After the baseline system was evaluated on the 
development set we iteratively added some rules to 
optimize the system output.  These rules are ap-
plied only when a reference matches the below 
stated condition, otherwise the result from the 
baseline system was used. 
The different rules that we deduced are as follows: 
? The referential expression is empty if its 
immediate preceding word is a conjunction 
and the referent?s syncat is np-subj. Thus 
the surface form of the refex is null. 
? In the people domain if the best case out-
put from the baseline results in Reg-type  = 
?name? and if earlier in the paragraph the 
person?s full name has been referred to, 
then subsequent references will have a 
shorter version of the referential expres-
sion i.e. shorter surface form (example: 
Zinn?s instead of Howard Zinn?s) 
? If the same sentence spans two or more 
references then generally a pronoun form 
is used if a noun has been used earlier. 
? Generally common form of the noun is 
used instead of the baseline pronoun out-
put if words like in, for, to, of, in precedes 
the reference (maximum distance 3 
words). This rule is applied to all domains 
except people. 
The first and the last rules had some effect to 
the system but the improvement from the other 
rules was very negligible. Final results are tabu-
lated in Table 2. 
4 Results 
We provide final results of our system in Table 2 
Script geval.pl was provided by the organizers for 
this purpose. We see that inclusion of the above 
rules in the system increased it?s accuracy by al-
most 4-5%. More rules can be added to system by 
studying cases of the training set which do not get 
classified correctly by the best case baseline sys-
tem. Overall reg08 accuracy, precision and recall 
were 66.4 %.
