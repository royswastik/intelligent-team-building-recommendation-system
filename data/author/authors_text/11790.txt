Abstract 
This paper describes the name entity transli-
teration system which we conducted for the 
?NEWS2009 Machine Transliteration Shared 
Task? (Li et al2009). We get the translitera-
tion in Chinese from an English name with 
three steps. We syllabify the English name 
into a sequence of syllables by some rules, 
and generate the most probable Pinyin se-
quence with the mapping model of English 
syllables to Pinyin (EP model), then we con-
vert the Pinyin sequence into a Chinese cha-
racter sequence with the mapping model of 
Pinyin to characters (PC model). And we get 
the final Chinese character sequence. Our 
system achieves an ACC of 0.498 and a 
Mean F-score of 0.786 in the official evalua-
tion result. 
1 Introduction 
The main subject of shared task is to translate 
English names (source language) to Chinese 
names (target language). Firstly, we fix some 
rules and syllabify the English names into a se-
quence of syllables by these rules, in the mean-
while, we convert the Chinese names into Pinyin 
sequence. Secondly, we construct an EP model 
referring to the method of phrase-based machine 
translation. In the next, we construct a 2-gram 
language model on characters and a chart reflect-
ing the using frequency of each character with 
the same pronunciation, both of which constitute 
the PC model converting Pinyin sequence into 
character sequence. When a Pinyin is mapped to 
several different characters, we can use them to 
make a choice. In our experiment, we adopt the 
corpus provided by NEWS2009 (Li et al2004) 
and the LDC Name Entity Lists 1 respectively to 
conduct two EP models, while the NEWS2009 
corpus for the PC model. The experiment indi-
cates that the larger a training corpus is, the more 
precise the transliteration is. 
2 Transliteration System Description 
Knowing from the definition of transliteration, 
we must make the translating result maintain the 
original pronunciation in source language. We 
found that most English letters and letter compo-
sitions? pronunciation are relatively fixed, so we 
can take a syllabification on an English name, 
therefore the syllable sequence can represent its 
pronunciation. In Chinese, Pinyin is used to 
represent a character?s pronunciation. Based on 
these analyses, we transliterate the English sylla-
ble sequence into a Pinyin sequence, and then 
translate the Pinyin sequence into characters. 
We suppose that the probability of a translitera-
tion from an English name to a Chinese name is 
denoted by P(Ch|En), the probability of a transla-
tion from an English syllable sequence to a Pi-
nyin  sequence is denoted by P(Py|En), and the 
probability of a translation from a Pinyin se-
quence to a characters is denoted by P(Ch|Py), 
then we can get the formula: 
P(Ch|En) = P(Ch|Py) * P(Py|En)      (1) 
The character sequence in candidates having 
the max value of P(Ch|En) is the best translitera-
tion(Wan and Verspoor, 1998). 
2.1 Syllabification of English Names 
English letters can be divided into vowel letters 
(VL) and consonant letters (CL). Usually, in a

log No.: LDC2005T34

word, a phonetic syllable can be constructed in a 
structure of CL+VL, CL+VL+CL, CL+VL+NL. 
To adapt for Chinese phonetic rule, we divide the 
continuous CLs into independent CLs(IC) and 
divide structure of CL+VL+CL into CL+VL and 
an IC. Take ?Ronald? as an example, it can be 
syllabified into ?Ro/na/l/d?, ?Ro? is CL+VL, 
?nal? is CL+VL+CL, and is divided into CL+VL 
and IC. ?d? is an independent CL(KUO et al 
2007). Of course there are some English names 
more complex to be syllabified, so we define 
seven rules for syllabification (JIANG et al 
2006): 
(1) Define English letter set as O, vowel set as 
V={a, e, i, o, u}, consonant set as C=O-V. 
(2) Replace all ?x? in a name with ?ks? before 
syllabification because it?s always pro-
nounced as  ?ks?. 
(3) The continuous VLs should be regarded as 
one VL. 
(4) There are some special cases in rule (3), 
the continuous VLs like ?oi?, ?io?, ?eo? 
are pronounced as two syllables, so they 
should be cut into two parts, so ?Wilhoit? 
will be syllabifyd into ?wi/l/ho/i/t?. 
(5) The continuous CLs should be cut into 
several independent CLs. If the last one is 
followed by some VLs, they will make up 
a syllable. 
(6) Some continuous CLs are pronounced as a 
syllable, such as ?ck?, ?th?, these CLs will 
not be syllabifyd and be regarded as a sin-
gle CL, ?Jack? is syllabifyd into ?Ja/ck?. 
(7) There are some other composition with the 
structure of VL+CL, such as ?ing?, ?er?, 
?an? and so on. If it?s a consonant behind 
these compositions in the name, we can 
syllabify it at the end of the composition, 
while if it?s a vowel behind them, we 
should double write the last letter and syl-
labify the word between the two same let-
ters. 
After syllabicating English names, we convert 
corresponding Chinese names into Pinyin. There 
are a few characters with multiple pronunciations 
in the training data, we find them out and ensure 
its pronunciation in a name manually.  
We record all of these syllables got from the 
training data set, if we meet a syllable out of vo-
cabulary when transliterating an English name, 
we will find a similar one with the shortest edit-
distance in the vocabulary to replace that. 
2.2 Mapping Model of English Syllables to 
Pinyins 
The EP model consists of a phrase-based ma-
chine translation model with a trigram language 
model.  
Given an English name f, we want to find its 
Chinese translation e, which maximize the condi-
tional probability )|Pr( fe , as shown below. 
)|Pr(maxarg* fee e?
    (2) 
Using Bayes rule, (1) can be decomposed into 
a Translation Model )|Pr( ef  and a Language 
Model )Pr(e  (Brown et al 1993), which can 
both be trained separately. These models are 
usually regarded as features and combined with 
scaling factors to form a log-linear model (Och 
and Ney 2002). It can then be written as: 
? ?

        (3) 
In our model, we use the following features: 
? phrase translation probability )|( fep  
? lexical weighting )|( felex  
? inverse phrase translation probability 
)|( efp  
? inverse lexical weighting )|( eflex   
? phrase penalty (always exp(1) = 2.718) 
? word penalty (target name length) 
? target language model, trigram 
The first five features can be seen as a whole 
phrase translation cost and used as one during 
decoding.  
In general, the translation process can be de-
scribed as follows: 
(1). Segmenting input English syllable se-
quence f into J syllables Jf 1  
(2). Translating each English syllable 
jf  
into several Pinyins 
jke  
(3). Selecting the N-best words 
nee ...1 , 
combined with reordering and Language 
Model and other features 
97
(4). Rescoring the translation word set with 
additional features to find the best one. 
We use SRI toolkit to train our trigram lan-
guage model with modified Kneser-Ney smooth-
ing (Chen and Goodman 1998). In the standard 
experiment, we use training data set provided by 
NEWS2009 (Li et al2004) to train this language 
model, in the nonstandard one, we use that and 
the LDC Name Entity Lists to train this language 
model. 
2.3 Mapping Model of Pinyins to Chinese 
Characters 
Since the Chinese characters used in people 
names are limited, most of the conversions from 
Pinyin to character are fixed. But some Pinyins 
still have several corresponding characters, and 
we should make a choice among these characters. 
To solve this problem, we conduct a PC model 
consisting a frequency chart which reflects the 
using frequency of each character at different 
positions in the names and a 2-gram language 
model with absolute discounting smoothing.  
A Chinese name is represented as C1C2?
Cn?Ci (1?i?n) is a Chinese character. C1 is at 
the first position, we call it FW; C2 ?Cn-1 are in 
the middle, we call them MW; Cn is at the last 
position, we call it LW. Usually, each character 
has different frequencies at these three positions. 
In the training data set of NEWS2009, Pinyin 
?luo? can be mapped to three characters: ???, 
???, and ???, each of them has different fre-
quencies at different positions. 
 
 FW MW LW 
? 0.677 0.647 0.501 
? 0.323 0.352 0.499 
? 0 0.001 0 
Table 1. Different frequencies at different positions 
 
From this table, we can see that at FW and 
MW position, ??? is more probable to be cho-
sen than the others, but sometimes ??? or ??? 
is the correct one. In order to ensure characters 
with lower frequency like ??? and ??? can be 
chosen firstly in a certain context, we conduct a 
2-gram language model.  
If a Pinyin can be mapped to several charac-
ters, the condition probability (P(Chi|py)) indicat-
ing that how possible a character should be cho-
sen is determined by the weighted average of its 
position frequency (P(Chi|pos)) and its probabili-
ty in the 2-gram language model (P(Chi|Chi-1)). 
P(Chi|py) = a*P(Chi|pos)+(1-a)*P(Chi|Chi-1)  (4) 
0 < a < 1. In our experiments, we set a = 0.1.  
2.4 Experiments and Results 
We carried out two experiments. The difference 
between them is the training data for EP model. 
The standard experiment adopts corpus provided 
by NEWS2009, while the nonstandard one 
adopts LDC Name Entity Lists. 
 
Corpora Name Num

Table 2. Corpora used for training the EP model 
 
Considering that an English name may be 
translated to different Chinese names in different 
corpora, so we established a unique PC model 
with the training data set provided by 
NEWS2009 to avoid the model?s deviation 
caused by different corpora. 
The experimenting data is the development 
data set provided by NEWS2009 (Li et al2004), 
testing script is also provided by NEWS2009. 
First, we take a syllabification on testing 
names.  Then we use the EP model to generate 5-
best Pinyin sequences and their probabilities.  
For each Pinyin sequence, the PC model gives 3-
best character sequences and their probabilities. 
In the end, we sort the results by probabilities of 
character sequences and corresponding Pinyin 
sequences. 
The evaluation results are shown below. 
 
Metrics Standard Nonstandard 
ACC 0.490677 0.502417 
Mean F-score 0.782039 0.784203 
MRR 0.606424 0.611214 
MAP_ref 0.490677 0.502417 
MAP_10 0.189290 0.189782 
MAP_sys 0.191476 0.192129 
Table 3. Evaluation results of standard and             
nonstandard experiments 
It?s easy to see that nonstandard test is better 
than standard one on each metric. A larger cor-
pus does make a contribution to a more accurate 
model.

For the official evaluation, we make two tests 
on the testing data set provided by NEWS2009 
(Li et al2004). The table 4 shows respectively 
the evaluation results of standard and nonstan-
dard tests given by NEWS2009.

3 Conclusion 
We construct a name entity transliteration system 
based on syllable. This system syllabifies Eng-
lish names by rules, then translates the syllables 
to Pinyin and Chinese characters by statistics 
model. We found that a larger corpus may im-
prove the transliteration. Besides, we can do 
something else to improve that. We need to fix 
more complex rules for syllabification. If we can 
get the name user?s gender from some features of 
the name itself, then translate the male and fe-
male names on different Chinese character sets, 
the results may be more precise.
