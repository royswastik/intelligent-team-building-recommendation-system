Abstract
We consider the language identification
problem for search engine queries. First,
we propose a method to automatically
generate a data set, which uses click-
through logs of the Yahoo! Search En-
gine to derive the language of a query indi-
rectly from the language of the documents
clicked by the users. Next, we use this
data set to train two decision tree classi-
fiers; one that only uses linguistic features
and is aimed for textual language identi-
fication, and one that additionally uses a
non-linguistic feature, and is geared to-
wards the identification of the language
intended by the users of the search en-
gine. Our results show that our method
produces a highly reliable data set very ef-
ficiently, and our decision tree classifier
outperforms some of the best methods that
have been proposed for the task of written
language identification on the domain of
search engine queries.
1 Introduction
The language identification problem refers to the
task of deciding in which natural language a given
text is written. Although the problem is heav-
ily studied by the Natural Language Processing
community, most of the research carried out to
date has been concerned with relatively long texts
such as articles or web pages which usually con-
tain enough text for the systems built for this task
to reach almost perfect accuracy. Figure 1 shows
the performance of 6 different language identifi-
cation methods on written texts of 10 European
languages that use the Roman Alphabet. It can
be seen that the methods reach a very high ac-
curacy when the text has 100 or more characters.
However, search engine queries are very short in
length; they have about 2 to 3 words on average,

tion methods on varying text size. Adapted from
(Poutsma, 2001).
which requires a reconsideration of the existing
methods built for this problem.
Correct identification of the language of the
queries is of critical importance to search engines.
Major search engines such as Yahoo! Search
(www.yahoo.com), or Google (www.google.com)
crawl billions of web pages in more than 50 lan-
guages, and about a quarter of their queries are in
languages other than English. Therefore a correct
identification of the language of a query is needed
in order to aid the search engine towards more ac-
curate results. Moreover, it also helps further pro-
cessing of the queries, such as stemming or spell
checking of the query terms.
One of the challenges in this problem is the lack
of any standard or publicly available data set. Fur-
thermore, creating such a data set is expensive as
it requires an extensive amount of work by hu-
man annotators. In this paper, we introduce a new
method to overcome this bottleneck by automat-
ically generating a data set of queries with lan-
guage annotations. We show that the data gener-
ated this way is highly reliable and can be used to
train a machine learning algorithm.
We also distinguish the problem of identifying
the textual language vs. the language intended by
the users for the search engine queries. For search
engines, there are cases where a correct identifi-
1066
cation of the language does not necessarily im-
ply that the user wants to see the results in the
same language. For example, although the textual
identification of the language for the query ?homo
sapiens? is Latin, a user entering this query from
Spain, would most probably want to see Spanish
web pages, rather than web pages in Latin. We ad-
dress this issue by adding a non-linguistic feature
to our system.
We organize the rest of the paper as follows:
First, we provide an overview of the previous re-
search in this area. Second, we present our method
to automatically generate a data set, and evaluate
the effectiveness of this technique. As a result of
this evaluation, we obtain a human-annotated data
set which we use to evaluate the systems imple-
mented in the following sections. In Section 4, we
implement some of the existing models and com-
pare their performance on our test set. We then
use the results from these models to build a deci-
sion tree system. Next, we consider identifying the
language intended by the user for the results of the
query, and describe a system geared towards this
task. Finally, we conclude our study and discuss
the future directions for the problem.
2 Related Work
Most of the work carried out to date on the writ-
ten language identification problem consists of su-
pervised approaches that are trained on a list of
words or n-gram models for each reference lan-
guage. The word based approaches use a list of
short words, common words, or a complete vocab-
ulary which are extracted from a corpus for each
language. The short words approach uses a list of
words with at most four or five characters; such as
determiners, prepositions, and conjunctions, and
is used in (Ingle, 1976; Grefenstette, 1995). The
common words method is a generalization over
the short words one which, in addition, includes
other frequently occuring words without limiting
them to a specific length, and is used in (Souter et
al., 1994; Cowie et al, 1999). For classification,
the word-based approaches sort the list of words in
descending order of their frequency in the corpus
from which they are extracted. Then the likelihood
of each word in a given text can be calculated by
using rank-order statistics or by transforming the
frequencies into probabilities.
The n-gram based approaches are based on the
counts of character or byte n-grams, which are se-
quences of n characters or bytes, extracted from
a corpus for each reference language. Different
classification models that use the n-gram features
have been proposed. (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994)
used an out-of-place rank order statistic to mea-
sure the distance of a given text to the n-gram
profile of each language. (Dunning, 1994) pro-
posed a system that uses Markov Chains of byte n-
grams with Bayesian Decision Rules to minimize
the probability error. (Grefenstette, 1995) simply
used trigram counts that are transformed into prob-
abilities, and found this superior to the short words
technique. (Sibun and Reynar, 1996) used Rela-
tive Entropy by first generating n-gram probabil-
ity distributions for both training and test data, and
then measuring the distance between the two prob-
ability distributions by using the Kullback-Liebler
Distance. (Poutsma, 2001) developed a system
based on Monte Carlo Sampling.
Linguini, a system proposed by (Prager, 1999),
combines the word-based and n-gram models us-
ing a vector-space based model and examines the
effectiveness of the combined model and the in-
dividual features on varying text size. Similarly,
(Lena Grothe and Nrnberger, 2008) combines both
models using the ad-hoc method of (Cavnar and
Trenkle, 1994), and also presents a comparison
study. The work most closely related to ours is
presented very recently in (Hammarstro?m, 2007),
which proposes a model that uses a frequency dic-
tionary together with affix information in order to
identify the language of texts as short as one word.
Other systems that use methods aside from
the ones discussed above have also been pro-
posed. (Takci and Sogukpinar, 2004) used letter
frequency features in a centroid based classifica-
tion model. (Kruengkrai et al, 2005) proposed a
feature based on alignment of string kernels us-
ing suffix trees, and used it in two different clas-
sifiers. Finally, (Biemann and Teresniak, 2005)
presented an unsupervised system that clusters the
words based on sentence co-occurence.
Recently, (Hughes et al, 2006) surveyed the
previous work in this area and suggested that the
problem of language identification for written re-
sources, although well studied, has too many open
challenges which requires a more systematic and
collaborative study.
3 Data Generation
We start the construction of our data set by re-
trieving the queries, together with the clicked urls,
from the Yahoo! Search Engine for a three months
time period. For each language desired in our data
set, we retrieve the queries from the corresponding
1067
Yahoo! web site in which the default language is
the same as the one sought.1 Then we preprocess
the queries by getting rid of the ones that have any
numbers or special characters in them, removing
extra spaces between query terms, and lowercas-
ing all the letters of the queries2. Next, we ag-
gregate the queries that are exactly the same, by
calculating the frequencies of the urls clicked for
each query.
As we pointed out in Section 1, and illustrated
in Figure 1, the language identification methods
give almost perfect accuracy when the text has 100
or more characters. Furthermore, it is suggested in
(Levering and Cutler, 2006) that the average tex-
tual content in a web page is 474 words. Thus we
assume that it is a fairly trivial task to identify the
language for an average web page using one of the
existing methods.3 In our case, this task gets al-
ready accomplished by the crawler for all the web
pages crawled by the search engine.
Thus we can summarize our information in two
separate tables; T1 and T2. For Table T1, we have
a set of queries Q, and each q ? Q maps to a
set of url-frequency pairs. Each mapping is of the
form (q, u, fu), where u is a url clicked for q, and
fu is the frequency of u. Table T2, on the other
hand, contains the urls of all the web pages known
to the search engine and has only two columns;
(u, l), where u is a unique url, and l is the language
identified for u. Since we do not consider multi-
lingual web pages, every url in T2 is unique and
has only one language associated with it.
Next, we combine the tables T1 and T2 using
an inner join operation on the url columns. After
the join, we group the results by the language and
query columns, during which we also count the
number of distinct urls per query, and sum their
frequencies. We illustrate this operation with a
SQL query in Algorithm 1. As a result of these
operations, we have, for each query q ? Q, a set of
triplets (l, fl, cu,l) where l is a language, fl is the
count of clicks for l (which we obtained through
the urls in language l), and cu,l is the count of
unique urls in language l.
The resulting table T3 associates queries with
languages, but also contains a lot of noise. First,
1We do not make a distinction between the different di-
alects of the same languge. For English, Spanish and Por-
tuguese we gather queries from the web sites of United States,
Mexico, and Brazil respectively.
2In this study, we only considered languages that use the
Roman alphabet.
3Although not done in this study, the urls of web pages
that have less than a defined number of words, such as 100,
can be discarded to ensure a higher confidence.
Input: Tables T1:[q, u, fu], T2:[u, l]
Output: Table T3:[q, l, fl, cu,l]
CREATE VIEW T3 AS
SELECT
T1.q, T2.l, COUNT(T1.u) AS cu,l, SUM(T1.fu) AS fl
FROM T1
INNER JOIN T2
ON T1.u = T2.u
GROUP BY q, l;
Algorithm 1: Join Tables T1 and T2, group by
query and language, aggregate distinct url and fre-
quency counts.
we have queries that map to more than one lan-
guage, which suggests that the users clicked on the
urls in different languages for the same query. To
quantify the strength of each of these mappings,
we calculate a weight wq,l for each mapping of a
query q to a language l as:
wq,l = fl/Fq
where Fq, the total frequency of a query q, is de-
fined as:
Fq =
?
l?Lq
fl
where Lq is the set of languages for which q has a
mapping. Having computed a weight wq,l for each
mapping, we introduce our first threshold param-
eter, W . We eliminate all the queries in our data
set, which have weights, wq,l, below the threshold
W .
Second, even though some of the queries map to
only one language, this mapping cannot be trusted
due to the high frequency of the queries together
with too few distinct urls. This case suggests that
the query is most likely navigational. The intent
of navigational queries, such as ?ACL 2009?, is to
find a particular web site. Therefore they usually
consist of proper names, or acronyms that would
not be of much use to our language identification
problem. Hence we would like to get rid of the
navigational queries in our data set by using some
of the features proposed for the task of automatic
taxonomy of search engine queries. For a more
detailed discussion of this task, we refer the reader
to (Broder, 2002; Rose and Levinson, 2004; Lee et
al., 2005; Liu et al, 2006; Jansen et al, 2008).
Two of the features used in (Liu et al, 2006)
in identification of the navigational queries from
click-through data, are the number of Clicks Satis-
fied (nCS) and number of Results Satisfied (nRS).
In our problem, we substitute nCS with Fq, the to-
tal click frequency of the query q, and nRS with
1068
Uq, the number of distinct urls clicked for q. Thus
we eliminate the queries that have a total click fre-
quency above a given frequency threshold F , and,
that have less than a given distinct number of urls,
U . Thus, we have three parameters that help us in
eliminating the noise from the inital data; W , F ,
and U . We show the usage of these parameters in
SQL queries, in Algorithm 2.
Input: Tables T1:[q, u, fu], T2:[u, l], T3:[q, l, fl, cu,l]
Parameters W , F , and U
Output: Table D:[q, l]
CREATE VIEW T4 AS
SELECT T1.q, COUNT(T1.u) AS cu, SUM(T1.fu) AS Fq
FROM T1
INNER JOIN T2 ON T1.u = T2.u
GROUP BY q;
CREATE VIEW D AS
SELECT T3.q, T3.l, T3.fl / T4.Fq AS wq,l
FROM T1
INNER JOIN T4 ON T3.q = T4.q 10
WHERE
T4.Fq < F AND
wq,l >= W AND
T4.cu,l >= U ;
Algorithm 2: Construction of the final data set
D, by eliminating queries from T3 based on the
parameters W , F , and U .
The parameters F , U , and W are actually de-
pendent on the size of the data set under consid-
eration, and the study in (Silverstein et al, 1999)
suggests that we can get enough click-through data
for our analysis by retrieving a large sample of
queries. Since we retrieve the queries that are sub-
mitted within a three months period, for each lan-
guage, we have millions of unique queries in our
data set. Investigating a held-out development set
of queries retrieved from the United States web
site (www.yahoo.com), we empirically decided
the following values for the parameters, W = 1,
F = 50, and U = 5. In other words, we only
accepted the queries for which the contents of the
urls agree on the same language, that are submit-
ted less than 50 times, and at least have 5 unique
urls clicked.
The filtering process leaves us with 5-10% of
the queries due to the conservative choice of the
parameters. From the resulting set, we randomly
picked 500 queries and asked a native speaker to
annotate them. For each query, the annotator was
to classify the query into one of three categories:
? Category-1: If the query does not contain
any foreign terms.
Language Category-1 Category-1+2 Category-3
English 90.6% 94.2% 5.8%
French 84.6% 93.4% 6.6%
Portuguese 85.2% 93.4% 6.6%
Spanish 86.6% 97.4% 2.6%
Italian 82.4% 96.6% 3.4%
German 76.8% 87.2% 12.8%
Dutch 81.0% 92.0% 8.0%
Danish 82.4% 93.2% 6.8%
Finnish 87.2% 94.0% 6.0%
Swedish 86.6% 95.4% 4.6%
Average 84.3% 93.7% 6.3%
Table 1: Annotation of 500 sample queries drawn
from the automatically generated data.
? Category-2: If there exists some foreign
terms but the query would still be expected
to bring web pages in the same language.
? Category-3: If the query belongs to other
languages, or all the terms are foreign to the
annotator.4
90.6% of the queries in our data set were anno-
tated as Category-1, and 94.2% as Category-1 and
Category-2 combined. Having successful results
for the United States data set, we applied the same
parameters to the data sets retrieved for other lan-
guages as well, and had the native speakers of each
language annotate the queries in the same way. We
list these results in Table 1.
The results for English have the highest accu-
racy for Category-1, mostly due to the fact that we
tuned our parameters using the United States data.
The scores for German on the other hand, are the
lowest. We attribute this fact to the highly multi-
linguality of the Yahoo! Germany website, which
receives a high number of non-German queries.
In order to see how much of this multi-linguality
our parameter selection successfully eliminate, we
randomly picked 500 queries from the aggregated
but unfiltered queries of the Yahoo! Germany
website, and had them annotated as before.
As suspected, the second annotation results
showed that, only 47.6% of the queries were an-
notated as Category-1 and 60.2% are annotated
as Category-1 and Category-2 combined. Our
method was indeed successful and achieved 29.2%
improvement over Category-1, and 27% improve-
ment over Category-1 and Category-2 queries
combined.
Another interesting fact to note is the absolute
differences between Category-1 and Category-1+2
scores. While this number is very low, 3.8%,
for English, it is much higher for the other lan-
4We do not expect the annotators to know the etymology
of the words or have the knowledge of all the acronyms.

guages. Through an investigation of Category-2
non-English queries, we find out that this is mostly
due to the usage of some common internet or
computer terms such as ?download?, ?software?,
?flash player?, among other native language query
terms.
4 Language Identification
We start this section with the implementation of
three models each of which use a different exist-
ing feature. We categorize these models as statis-
tical, knowledge based, and morphological. We
then combine all three models in a machine learn-
ing framework using a novel approach. Finally, we
extend this framework by adding a non-linguistic
feature in order to identify the language intended
by the search engine user.
To train each model implemented, we used the
EuroParl Corpora, (Koehn, 2005), and the same 10
languages in Section 3. EuroParl Corpora is well
balanced, so we would not have any bias towards
a particular language resulting from our choice of
the corpora.
We tested all the systems in this section on a
test set of 3500 human annotated queries, which
is formed by taking 350 Category-1 queries from
each language. All the queries in the test set are
obtained from the evaluation results in Section
3. In Table 2, we give the properties of this test
set. We list the minimum, maximum, and average
number of characters and words (MinC, MaxC,
?C , MinW, MaxW, and ?W respectively).
As can be seen in Table 2, the queries in our test
set have 18.8 characters on average, which is much
lower than the threshold suggested by the existing
systems to achieve a good accuracy. Another in-
teresting fact about the test set is that, languages
which are in the bottom half of Table 2 (German,
Dutch, Danish, Finnish, and Swedish) have lower
number of characters and words on average com-
pared to the languages in the upper half. This
is due to the characteristics of those languages,
which allow the construction of composite words
from multiple words, or have a richer morphology.
Thus, the concepts can be expressed in less num-
ber of words or characters.
4.1 Models for Language Identification
We implement a statistical model using a charac-
ter based n-gram feature. For each language, we
collect the n-gram counts (for n = 1 to n = 7
also using the word beginning and ending spaces)
from the vocabulary of the training corpus, and
then generate a probability distribution from these
counts. We implemented this model using the
SRILM Toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) with the mod-
ified Kneser-Ney Discounting and interpolation
options. For comparison purposes, we also imple-
mented the Rank-Order method using the parame-
ters described in (Cavnar and Trenkle, 1994).
For the knowledge based method, we used the
vocabulary of each language obtained from the
training corpora, together with the word counts.
From these counts, we obtained a probability dis-
tribution for all the words in our vocabulary. In
other words, this time we used a word-based n-
gram method, only with n = 1. It should be noted
that increasing the size of n, which might help in
language identification of other types of written
texts, will not be helpful in this task due to the
unique nature of the search engine queries.
For the morphological feature; we gathered the
affix information for each language from the cor-
pora in an unsupervised fashion as described in
(Hammarstro?m, 2006). This method basically
considers each possible morphological segmenta-
tion of the words in the training corpora by as-
suming a high frequency of occurence of salient
affixes, and also assuming that words are made up
of random characters. Each possible affix is as-
signed a score based on its frequency, random ad-
justment, and curve-drop probabilities, which re-
spectively indicate the probability of the affix be-
ing a random sequence, and the probability of be-
ing a valid morphological segment based on the in-
formation of the preceding or the succeding char-
acter. In Table 3, we present the top 10 results of
the probability distributions obtained from the vo-
cabulary of English, Finnish, and German corpora.
We give the performance of each model on
our test set in Table 4. The character based n-
gram model outperforms all the other models with
the exception of French, Spanish, and Italian on
which the word-based unigram model is better.

Table 3: Top 10 prefixes and suffixes together with
their probabilities, obtained for English, Finnish,
and German.
The word-based unigram model performs poorly
on languages that may have highly inflected or
composite words such as Finnish, Swedish, and
German. This result is expected as we cannot
make sure that the training corpus will include
all the possible inflections or compositions of the
words in the language. The Rank-Order method
performs poorly compared to the character based
n-gram model, which suggests that for shorter
texts, a well-defined probability distribution with a
proper discounting strategy is better than using an
ad-hoc ranking method. The success of the mor-
phological feature depends heavily on the prob-
ability distribution of affixes in each language,
which in turn depends on the corpus due to the un-
supervised affix extraction algorithm. As can be
seen in Table 3, English affixes have a more uni-
form distribution than both Finnish and German.
Each model implemented in the previous sec-
tion has both strengths and weaknesses. The sta-
tistical approach is more robust to noise, such as
misspellings, than the others, however it may fail
to identify short queries or single words because
of the lack of enough evidence, and it may confuse
two languages that are very similar. In such cases,
the knowledge-based model could be more useful,
as it can find those query terms in the vocabulary.
On the other hand, the knowledge-based model
would have a sparse vocabulary for languages that
can have heavily inflected words such as Turkish,
and Finnish. In such cases, the morphological fea-
ture could provide a strong clue for identification
from the affix information of the terms.
4.2 Decision Tree Classification
Noting the fact that each model can complement
the other(s) in certain cases, we combined them by
using a decision tree (DT) classifier. We trained
the classifier using the automatically annotated
data set, which we created in Section 3. Since
this set comes with a certain amount of noise, we

individual features, and the Rank-Order method
on the test set.
pruned the DT during the training phase to avoid
overfitting. This way, we built a robust machine
learning framework at a very low cost and without
any human labour.
As the features of our DT classifier, we use the
results of the models that are implemented in Sec-
tion 4.1, together with the confidence scores cal-
culated for each instance. To calculate a confi-
dence score for the models, we note that since
each model makes its selection based on the lan-
guage that gives the highest probability, a confi-
dence score should indicate the relative highness
of that probability compared to the probabilities
of other languages. To calculate this relative high-
ness, we use the Kurtosis measure, which indicates
how peaked or flat the probabilities in a distribu-
tion are compared to a normal distribution. To cal-
culate the Kurtosis value, ?, we use the equation
below.
? =
?
l?L(pl ? ?)
4
(N ? 1)?4
where L is the set of languages, N is the number
of languages in the set, pl is the probability for
language l ? L, and ? and ? are respectively the
mean and the the standard deviation values of P =
{pl|l ? L}.
We calculate a ? measure for the result of each
model, and then discretize it into one of three cat-
egories:
? HIGH: If ? ? (?? + ??)
? MEDIUM: If [? > (?????)?? < (??+??)]
? LOW: If ? ? (?? ? ??)
where ?? and ?? are the mean and the standard
deviation values respectively, for a set of confi-
dence scores calculated for a model on a small de-
velopment set of 25 annotated queries from each
language. For the statistical model, we found
?? = 4.47, and ?? = 1.96, for the knowledge

based ?? = 4.69, and ?? = 3.31, and finally for
the morphological model we found ?? = 4.65, and
?? = 2.25.
Hence, for a given query, we calculate the iden-
tification result of each model together with the
model?s confidence score, and then discretize the
confidence score into one of the three categories
described above. Finally, in order to form an as-
sociation between the output of the model and
its confidence, we create a composite attribute by
appending the discretized confidence to the iden-
tified language. As an example, our statistical
model identifies the query ?the sovereign individ-
ual? as English (en), and reports a ? = 7.60,
which is greater than or equal to ??+ ?? = 4.47+
1.96 = 6.43. Therefore the resulting composite
attribute assigned to this query by the statistical
model is ?en-HIGH?.
We used the Weka Machine Learning Toolkit
(Witten and Frank, 2005) to implement our DT
classifier. We trained our system with 500, 1,000,
5,000, and 10,000 instances of the automatically
annotated data and evaluate it on the same test set
of 3500 human-annotated queries. We show the
results in Table 5.
The results in Table 5 show that our DT clas-
sifier, on average, outperforms all the models in
Table 4 for each size of the training data. Fur-
thermore, the performance of the system increases
with the increasing size of training data. In par-
ticular, the improvement that we get for Spanish,
French, and German queries are strikingly good.
This shows that our DT classifier can take ad-
vantage of the complementary features to make
a better classification. The classifier that uses
10,000 instances gets outperformed by the statis-
tical model (by 4.9%) only in the identification of
English queries.
In order to evaluate the significance of our im-
provement, we performed a paired t-test, with a
null hypothesis and ? = 0.01 on the outputs of

the statistical model, and the DT classifier that
uses 10,000 training instances. The test resulted
in P = 1.12?10  ?, which strongly indicates
that the improvement of the DT classifier over the
statistical model is statistically significant.
In order to illustrate the errors made by our DT
classifier, we show the confusion matrixM in Fig-
ure 2. The matrix entry Mli,lj simply gives the
number of test instances that are in language li but
misclassified by the system as lj . From the figure,
we can infer that, Portuguese and Spanish are the
languages that are confused mostly by the system.
This is an expected result because of the high sim-
ilarity between the two languages.
4.3 Towards Identifying the Language Intent
As a final step in our study, we build another DT
classifier by introducing a non-linguistic feature
to our system, which is the language information
of the country from which the user entered the
query.5 Our intuition behind introducing this extra
feature is to help the search engine in guessing the
language in which the user wants to see the result-
ing web pages. Since the real purpose of a search
engine is to bring the expected results to its users,
we believe that a correct identification of the lan-
guage that the user intended for the results when
typing the query is an important first part of this
process.
To illustrate this with an example, we con-
sider the query, ?how to tape for plantar fasci-
itis?, which we selected among the 500 human-
annotated queries retrieved from the United States
web site. This query is labelled as Category-2 by
the human annotator. Our DT classifier, together
with the statistical and knowledge-based models,
classifies this query falsely as a Porteguese query,
which is most likely caused due to the presence of
the Latin phrase ?plantar fasciitis?.
In order to test the effectiveness of our new fea-
ture, we introduce all the Category-2 queries to our

test set and increase its size to 430 queries for each
language.6 Then we run both classifiers, with and
without the new feature, using a training data size
of 10,000 instances, and display the results in Ta-
ble 6. We also show the contribution of the new
feature as a standalone classifier in the first col-
umn of Table 6. We labeled the DT classifier that
we implemented in Section 4.2 as ?Classifier-1?
and the new one as ?Classifier-2?.
Interestingly, the results in Table 6 tell us that a
search engine can achieve a better accuracy than
Classifier-1 on average, should it decide to bring
the results based only on the geographical infor-
mation of its users. However one can argue that
this would be a bad idea for the web sites that re-
ceive a lot of visitors from all over the world, and
also are visited very often. For example, if the
search engine?s United States web site, which is
considered as one of the most important markets
in the world, was to employ such an approach, it?d
only receive 74.9% accuracy by misclassifying the
English queries entered from countries for which
the default language is not English. On the other
hand, when this geographical information is used
as a feature in our decision tree framework, we get
a very high boost on the accuracy of the results
for all the languages. As can be seen in Table 6,
Classifier-2 gives the best results.
5 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper, we considered the language identi-
fication problem for search engine queries. First,
we presented a completely automated method to
generate a reliable data set with language anno-
tations that can be used to train a decision tree
classifier. Second, we implemented three features
used in the existing language identification meth-

each language. For example, English has only 18 of them
whereas Italian has 71. Hence the resulting data set won?t be
balanced in terms of this category.
ods, and compared their performance. Next, we
built a decision tree classifier that improves the re-
sults on average by combining the outputs of the
three models together with their confidence scores.
Finally, we considered the practical application of
this problem for search engines, and built a second
classifier that takes into account the geographical
information of the users.
Human annotations on 5000 automatically an-
notated queries showed that our data generation
method is highly accurate, achieving 84.3% accu-
racy on average for Category-1 queries, and 93.7%
accuracy for Category-1 and Category-2 queries
combined. Furthermore, the process is fast as we
can get a data set of size approximately 50,000
queries in a few hours by using only 15 computers
in a cluster.
The decision tree classifier that we built for the
textual language identification in Section 4.2 out-
performs all three models that we implemented in
Section 4.1, for all the languages except English,
for which the statistical model is better by 4.9%,
and Swedish, for which we get a tie. Introducing
the geographical information feature to our deci-
sion tree framework boosts the accuracy greatly
even in the case of a noisier test set. This sug-
gests that the search engines can do a better job in
presenting the results to their users by taking the
non-linguistic features into account in identifying
the intended language of the queries.
In future, we would like to improve the accu-
racy of our data generation system by considering
additional features proposed in the studies of au-
tomated query taxonomy, and doing a more care-
ful examination in the assignment of the parameter
values. We are also planning to extend the num-
ber of languages in our data set. Furthermore, we
would like to improve the accuracy of Classifier-
2 with additional non-linguistic features. Finally,
we will consider other alternatives to the decision
tree framework when combining the results of the
models with their confidence scores.
