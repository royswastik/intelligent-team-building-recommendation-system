Abstract
The goal of the presented project is to as-
sign a structure of clauses to Czech sen-
tences from the Prague Dependency Tree-
bank (PDT) as a new layer of syntactic an-
notation, a layer of clause structure. The
annotation is based on the concept of seg-
ments, linguistically motivated and easily
automatically detectable units. The task
of the annotators is to identify relations
among segments, especially relations of
super/subordination, coordination, apposi-
tion and parenthesis. Then they identify
individual clauses forming complex sen-
tences.
In the pilot phase of the annotation, 2,699
sentences from PDT were annotated with
respect to their sentence structure.
1 Motivation
Syntactic analysis of natural languages is the
fundamental requirement of many applied tasks.
Parsers providing automatic syntactic analysis are
quite reliable for relatively short and simple sen-
tences. However, their reliability is significantly
lower for long and complex sentences, especially
for languages with free word order; see, e.g., Ze-
man (2004) for results for Czech.
The identification of the overall structure of
a sentence prior to its full syntactic analysis is
a natural step capable to reduce the complex-
ity of full analysis. Such methods brought good
results for typologically different languages, see
e.g. Jones (1994) for English or Ohno et al (2006)
for Japanese.
The goal of the presented project is to annotate
a structure of clauses to Czech sentences from the
Prague Dependency Treebank. The main idea is to
reuse the already existing language resource and to
enrich it with a new layer of annotation, a layer of
clause structure.
We exploit a concept of segments, easily auto-
matically detectable and linguistically motivated
units, as they were defined by Lopatkova? and
Holan (2009).1 The annotation captures relation-
ship among segments, especially subordination,
coordination, apposition and parenthesis. Based
on segment annotation, the annotators identify
clauses forming (complex) sentences: they group
the segments constituting individual clauses of
complex sentences.
Contrary to such well known approaches as e.g.
chunking, see Abney (1991) or cascaded parsing,
see Abney (1995) or Ciravegna and Lavelli (1999),
which group individual tokens into more complex
structures as nominal or prepositional phrases, i.e.,
in a bottom-up direction, the proposed approach
aims at determining a hierarchy of sentence parts
in a ?top-down? way. Such an approach is quite
novel not only for Czech, it has not been reported
for other Slavic languages.
Prague Dependency Treebank2 (PDT), see Hajic?
et al (2006) is a large and elaborated corpus
with rich syntactic annotation of Czech newspaper
texts. As the dependency-based framework has
been adopted for PDT, the treebank contains ex-
plicit information on mutual relations among in-
dividual tokens (words and punctuation marks).
However, relations among more complex units,
esp. clauses, are not explicitly indicated, see Fig-
ure 1.
Syntactic information stored in PDT can be
used (at least to some extent) for the identification
of individual clauses as well. Let us refer to the
experiments described in the papers by Lopatkova?
and Holan (2009) and Kru?za and Kubon? (2009). In
both papers, the authors designed well-developed
procedures for identifying segments and their mu-
1We adopt the basic idea of segments introduced and used
by Kubon? (2001) and Kubon? et al (2007). We slightly modify
it for the purposes of the annotation task.

tual relationship from the analytical layer of PDT
(i.e., layer of surface syntax). However, they ei-
ther do not identify individual clauses in the com-
plex sentence at all, or their procedural definition
of clause does not exactly model what a human
would consider as a clause.
The previous experiments brought clear speci-
fication of segmentation charts describing the re-
lation among individual segments. The results
showed that for further research it is necessary to
work with a large set of precisely annotated data.
It has turned out that such data cannot be obtained
without extensive (semi)manual annotation of a
large set of sentences, see Lopatkova? and Holan
(2009) and Kru?za and Kubon? (2009).
In this article, we present a project of man-
ual annotation of sentence structure for complex
Czech sentences. In Section 2, we introduce the
basic concepts, esp. boundaries, segments and
segmentation charts. Then we focus on the anno-
tation of basic linguistic phenomena (Section 3).
Section 4 brings specification of a data format and
an editor used for the annotation. Lastly, basic
statistics of the annotated data are presented (Sec-
tion 5).
2 Boundaries, Segments and
Segmentation Charts
The aim of the annotation is to explicitly describe
relations among clauses of (complex) Czech sen-
tences. We focus on the annotation of (part of)
Czech sentences from PDT. We take advantage
of morphological analysis (m-layer) and partially
also surface syntactic analysis (a-layer) stored in
PDT.
All tokens from PDT are disjunctively divided
into two groups ? ordinary words and segment
boundaries. Segment boundaries are tokens and
their sequences that divide a sentence into indi-
vidual units referred to as segments. As segment
boundaries, the following tokens are considered:
? punctuation marks: comma, colon, semi-
colon, question mark, exclamation mark,
dash (all types), opening and closing bracket
(all kinds), and quotation mark (all types);
? coordinating conjunctions: tokens morpho-
logical tag of which starts with the pair J?
(e.g., a ?and?, ale ?but?, nebo ?or?, nebot? ?for?,
ani ?nor?), see Hajic? (2004).
After the identification of boundaries, the in-
put sentence is partitioned into individual seg-
ments ? a segment is understood as a maximal
non-empty sequence of tokens that does not con-
tain any boundary.
This concept of the linear segment serves as a
good basis for the identification of clauses, basic
linguistically motivated syntactic units. We will
see that a single clause consists of one or more
segments; one or more clauses then create(s) a
complex sentence (see Section 3).
The definition of segments adopted in this
project is based on very strict rules for punctuation
in Czech. Generally, beginning and end of each
clause must be indicated by a boundary, i.e., sen-
tence boundary (usually fullstop, question mark or
exclamation mark), punctuation (mostly comma)
or conjunction. This holds for embedded clauses
as well. In particular, there are only very few ex-
ceptions to a general rule saying that there must be
some kind of a boundary between two finite verb
forms of meaningful verbs.
Segmentation Charts and Clauses
Relations between clauses, esp. super- or sub-
ordination, coordination, apposition or parenthe-
sis, are described by so called segmentation charts
(one or more, if we allow for ambiguous annota-
tion) ? segmentation chart captures the levels of
embedding for individual segments, as described
below.
75
The principal idea of the segmentation chart is
quite clear ? it can be described by the follow-
ing basic instructions. (In examples, segments are
marked by square brackets [ and ]k, where k is a
level of embedding. In addition, individual clauses
are marked by brackets { and }j , where j is an in-
dex of a particular clause.)
Main clauses. Segments forming all main
clauses3 of a complex sentence belong to the basic
level (level of embedding 0), as in the following
sentence.
{[O studium byl velky? za?jem]0}1, {[v pr?ij??mac??ch
pohovorech bylo vybra?no 50 uchazec?u?]0}2. ?There
was a lot of interest in studying, 50 applicants
were selected in admission interviews.?
Dependent clauses. Segments forming clauses
that depend on clauses at the k-th level obtain level
of embedding k + 1 (i.e., the level of embedding
for subordinated segments is higher than the level
of segments forming their governing clause).
{[Potom zjist??te]0}1, {[ z?e va?m nikdo neda? vstup-
n?? v??zum]1}2. ?Then you realize that nobody gives
you entrance visa.?
Coordination and apposition. Segments forming
coordinated sentence members and coordinated
clauses occupy the same level. The same holds
for apposition.
{[Hra na?m jde]0}1 a {[forma stoupa?]0}1. ?We?re
getting on well in game and our form improves.?
Parenthesis. Segments forming parenthesis
(e.g., sequence of wordforms within brackets) ob-
tain the level of embedding k + 1 if the level of
their neighboring segments is k .
{[Na?vrh mluv?? o dvou letech u muz?u?]0 ( {[zvys?uje
ve?k z 60 na 62]1}1 ) a [o c?tyr?ech letech u z?en]0}2.
?The proposal mentions two years for men (it
raises the age from 60 to 62) and four years for
women.?
Although this basic idea of segmentation charts
seems simple, it appears that ? working with ?real
data? from newspaper corpus ? detailed annota-
tion guidelines are necessary for good and con-
sistent annotation of specific linguistic phenomena
and especially for their combination. We focus on
some of them in the following section.
3As a main clauses, such clauses are considered that are
syntactically / formally independent, see also Section 3.
3 Annotation of Complex Sentences
Segments can be divided into two main groups,
mutually independent and mutually related seg-
ments.
Mutually independent segments. Mutually
independent segments are, e.g., segments forming
two dependent clauses, each of them modifying
(different) part of the main clause, as segments
do ktere? se zamiloval ?with whom he felt in love?
and ktery? zazvonil ?that rang? in the following
sentence.
{[Marie]0, {[do ktere? se zamiloval]1}1, {[kdyz?
ji potkal]2}2, [zvedla telefon]0}3, {[ktery?
zazvonil]1}4. ?Mary, with whom he felt in
love when he met her, answered the phone that
rang.?
Such segments can have the same level of em-
bedding (as the above mentioned segments) or
they can belong to clauses with different levels of
embedding (as segments kdyz? ji potkal ?when he
met her? and ktery? zazvonil ?that rang?).
Mutually related segments. Mutually related
segments either belong to different levels of em-
bedding ? they are super- or subordinated, we fo-
cus on this group in the following Section 3.1, or
they have the same level of embedding ? this type
is described in Section 3.2.
Let us stress here that the segment annotation
is based on formally expressed structures rather
than on their semantic interpretation. For exam-
ple, we do not interpret text enclosed in brackets
? whether it is semantically apposition, sentence
member or independent sentence part, see also the
discussion in Kubon? et al (2007). We annotate
such text as parenthetical segment(s) on a lower
level compared to the neighboring segments.
The annotators have been instructed to disam-
biguate annotated sentences ? if more readings of
a particular sentence are possible, they should re-
spect the reading rendered in PDT.
3.1 Subordination and Superordination
The super- or subordinated mutually related seg-
ments capture primarily relations between gov-
erning and dependent clauses.
Identification of subordinated status of a par-
ticular segment is based on morphological prop-
erties of tokens forming this segment, i.e., on the
presence of a token with ?subordinating function?.
76
?Subordinating tokens? are especially of the fol-
lowing types:
? subordinating conjunctions (e.g., aby ?in or-
der that?, dokud ?till?, kdyby ?if?, protoz?e ?be-
cause?, pr?estoz?e ?although?, z?e ?that?);
? relative/interrogative pronouns and some
types of numerals (e.g., kdo ?who?, co ?what?,
jaky? ?which?, kolik ?how many?);
? pronominal adverbs (e.g., kde ?where?, kdy
?when?, jak ?how?, proc? ?why?).
In Czech, a subordinating token is usually at the
beginning of the segment, as in the following sen-
tence (marked pronoun ktery? ?who? serves as sub-
ordinating token here).
{[Klejch]0 , {[ktery? dal deve?t ze dvana?cti ligovy?ch
go?lu? Zl??na]1}1 , [ma? vydatne? pomocn??ky]0}2. ?Kle-
jch who scored nine goals out of twelve for Zl??n
has good helpers.?
A particular subordinated segment can precede
or follow its superordinated segment or it can be
placed between two superordinated segments (in
case of a governing clause with embedded depen-
dent clause, as in the previous example).
In addition to governing and dependent clauses,
there are also other constructions that should evi-
dently be captured as subordinated segments, es-
pecially:
? Segments representing direct speech:
,,{[ Kupr???kladu za?vod Ejpovice projevil za?jem
dokonce o 150 pracovn??ku?]1}1,?{[ uvedl
Ladislav Vltavsky?]0}2. ? ?For example
Ejpovice company showed interest in 150
workers,? said Ladislav Vltavsky?.?
? Some types of parenthesis, esp. those
marked by brackets:
{[Guido Reni]0 ( {[1575 az? 1642]1}1 [byl
vynikaj??c?? figuralista]0}2. ?Guido Reni (1575
to 1642) was an outstanding figural painter.?
In such cases, parenthetical expressions are
captured as separate clauses even if they con-
sist of fragmental expression.
3.2 Segments on the Same Level and
Identification of Clauses
We can identify three main groups of structures
where segments are mutually related and they
share the same level of embedding:
? segments forming a clause with embedded
dependent clause, as the attributive depen-
dent clause in the following example.
{[V pr???pade?]0, {[z?e se nedovola?te]1}1,
[vytoc?te c???slo ve vec?ern??ch hodina?ch
znovu]0}2. ?In case that you will not succeed,
redial the number again in the evening.?
? coordinated segments (see the corresponding
section below);
? others, esp. segments in apposition and some
types of parenthesis (see the corresponding
section below).
In particular, segments on the same level ? un-
like the super/subordinated ones ? can form a sin-
gle clause. For the annotators, the important task
is to identify individual clauses. They group those
segments that constitute individual clauses of a
complex sentence and thus mark them as a sin-
gle syntactic unit of a higher level, level of clause
structures. (Let us recall that clauses are marked
here by brackets { and }j where j is an index of a
particular clause).
Coordination of sentence members and
coordination of clauses
The relation of coordination may occur between
two (or more) sentence members or between two
(or more) clauses, be they main clauses or depen-
dent ones. The syntactic position of coordinated
units is ?multiplied?, that is, they share the same
syntactic relations to other sentence members. The
annotators have to identify segments containing
coordinated sentence members and put them to-
gether into a single clause; coordinated clauses are
marked as separate clauses sharing the same level
of embedding,4 as in the following sentence.
{[C?esky? prezident apeloval na C?echy]0 a [na
Ne?mce]0}1, {[aby odpove?dne? zacha?zeli s min-
ulost??]1}2 a {[aby posouvali vpr?ed dialog]1 a
[spolupra?ci.]1}3 ?Czech president appealed to
Czechs and Germans that they should treat their
history responsibly and improve their mutual di-
alogue and cooperation.? This complex sentence
consists of five segments (marked by [ and ]),
which form three clauses (marked by { and }),
namely one main clause (on the zero level) and
two coordinated dependent clauses (first embed-
ded level), see also Figure 3.
4In PDT, coordination of sentence members and coordina-
tion of clauses are not distinguished (at the analytical layer).
77
Segmentation is purely linear (on segment fol-
lows another); after the identification of segments,
they are grouped into the clauses. As we have
seen, a single clause consists (prototypically) of
one or more segments. This is fully true for se-
mantically and syntactically complete sentences,
i.e. sentences without ellipses of different kinds.
Let us mention one construction where clauses
identified by the annotators (i.e., clauses based on
segments) do not conform with the linguistic intu-
ition, namely the case of coordinated clauses shar-
ing one (or more) sentence member(s) or a syntac-
tic particle. We interpret such cases as cases of el-
lipses, i.e., a shared sentence member or particle is
supposed to belong only to one of the clauses and
to be elided in the second clause. Thus a shared
sentence member or particle is annotated only as a
part of one clause.
{[Neopravuje se]0}1 a {[neinvestuje]0}2, {[pen??ze
stac??? jen na be?z?ny? provoz]0}1. ?They do not ren-
ovate nor invest, there is enough money only for
routine operation.? (The underlined reflexive par-
ticle belongs to both verbs opravovat ?to reno-
vate? and investovat ?to invest? (reflexive passive
forms of the verbs); in the segmentation chart, it is
marked as a part of the first clause Neopravuje se
and elided in the second clause neinvestuje.)
On the other hand, a basic rule was adopted say-
ing that a single finite verb form indicates a single
clause, i.e., verb constitutes (a core of) a sentence5
(providing that other formal labels as, e.g., brack-
ets do not indicate more levels). This rule implies
that if the shared sentence member is a predicate,
then the particular segments are joined together
into a single clause, as in the following example.
{[Petr pr?is?el vc?era]0 a [babic?ka dneska]0}1. ?Petr
came yesterday and my grandma today.?
Other constructions
Apposition is a construction where the same
?idea? is rendered in different ways (the latter be-
ing an explanatory equivalent of the former), both
having the same syntactic relation to other sen-
tence members (e.g., a name and a function of par-
ticular person, as in the following sentence).
{[Ozna?mil to Va?clav Havel]0, [president C?eske?
republiky]0}1. ?It was announced by Va?clav
Havel, president of the Czech Republic.?
Following PDT, apposition is treated in the
same way as coordination as the members of an
5The account for this decision lies in the verb-centric
character of dependency syntax traditionally used for Czech.
apposition are considered to share (multiple) syn-
tactic position in a sentence (like in the case of
coordination).
Contrary to PDT, parenthesis without ex-
plicit/unambiguous formal mark, as e.g. brackets,
is annotated as segment(s) on the same level as
its/their neighboring segments.
{[Pr?ed smrt??]0, {[nezna?mo proc?]0}1, [si koupil
tramvajenku]0}2. ?Before dying, nobody knows
why, he bought a tram pass.?
Again, parenthetical expressions are captured as
separate clauses even if they consist of fragmental
expression.
Semi-direct speech, i.e., direct speech without
quotation marks (or other formal label(s)) is anno-
tated as segment(s) on the same level as the seg-
ment containing a governing verb. The reason is
quite evident ? there is no formally expressed indi-
cation of subordination in the segment(s) creating
a semi-direct speech.
{[Pr?ijde pozde?ji]0}1, {[ohla?sil doma Pavel]0}2. ?I
will be late, said Pavel.?
4 Data Format and Editor for Segment
Annotation
4.1 PML Data Format
The Prague Markup Language6 (PML), see Pa-
jas and S?te?pa?nek (2006) is an XML-based domain
language which has been developed and is used as
primary data format for PDT (version 2.0).
The PDT 2.0 data consist of one non-annotated
word layer (w-layer) and three layers of annota-
tion: morphological (m-layer), analytical (a-layer)
and tectogrammatical (t-layer). In PML, individ-
ual layers of annotation can be stacked one over
another in a stand-off fashion and linked together
as well as with other data resources in a consistent
way.
We use two layers in our annotation editor,
namely the m-layer and the a-layer. The m-layer
provides the word form, lemma and tag for every
token. The a-layer represents syntactic relations
between tokens, resulting in an analytical tree. For
the segment annotation, only information on ana-
lytical functions of tokens is used ? it helps the an-
notators in their decisions on the appropriate level
of embedding and in disambiguation if more read-
ings of a particular sentence are possible.

Figure 2: Class hierarchy of SegView annotation
editor.
The output of the segment annotation is stored
as a new layer of annotation, the seg-layer.
4.2 SegView Annotation Editor
The SegView annotation editor is implemented
completely in Java because of its cross-platformity
and availability of rich libraries. The presenta-
tion layer is implemented in the class MainWin-
dow using the standard Swing library. As for the
data layer, the editor works with files in the PML
format (see Section 4.1). The model represent-
ing the core of the implementation comprises three
classes: Sentence, Word and Segment, Figure 2.
After launching the editor, the user has the pos-
sibility to select multiple files to annotate. After
the selection, the program directly reads the files
and creates an internal representation with the in-
stances of the three aforementioned classes. The
manual annotation is saved in files with the exten-
sion .seg.
The screenshot of SegView editor is shown in
Figure 3.
5 Basic Statistics and Conclusion
We have described the pilot phase of the segment
annotation, during which 2,699 sentences from
PDT were annotated with respect to their sentence
structure.7 Table 1 summarizes the amount of an-
notated data and gives statistics on number of pro-
cessed segments and clauses.
The most frequent annotation patterns are pre-
sented in Table 2 showing the most common types
of sentences and relation among their clauses
(only patterns with more than 100 sentence in-
stances are listed).
7We have focused on the sentences from
data/full/amw/train2 portion of the PDT data.
# sentences 2,699
# segments 7,975
# clauses 5,003
max segments in clause 27
max clauses in sentence 11
max levels of embedding 4

195 2 2 1
148 3 2 1
123 3 1 0
111 2 2 0
Table 2: Distribution of segments and clauses.
The most frequent type of annotated sentence
consists of one segment only (and thus one
clause), then comes the case where two segments
form a single clause. The third position is for sen-
tences with two segments, each forming an in-
dividual clause, where one of them depends on
the other). The fourth case represents sentences
formed by two clauses, one either depending on
the other or forming a parenthesis. The fifth and
sixth line represent sentences with segments on the
same level, e.i., with sentence members in coordi-
nation or apposition and with coordinated clauses,
respectively. (The most common cases listed in
the table represent 61.5% of the annotated sen-
tences; the rest has more complicated structures.)
Future work
We focus on the inter-annotator agreement on a
reasonable large set of data now to check the con-
sistency between the human annotators. Then the
annotation will continue ? the goal is to cover
10% of sentences from PDT with assigned sen-
tence structure.
We expect the use of the manually annotated
data for testing tools and hypotheses on possible
sentence structures. The proposed amount of data
is comparable with the standard PDT testing data.
We do not foreseen the use of this set of segmen-
tation charts for training statistically-based tool(s)
for an automatic identification of sentence struc-
tures.
The set of precisely annotated data allows us
to solidly compare and evaluate the already ex-
isting automatic segmentation tools processing ei-
ther the raw texts or syntactically annotated trees,
see Kru?za and Kubon? (2009) and Lopatkova? and
79

Holan (2009). These data also allow us to search
for systemic differences between the manual and
automatic sentence structure annotation. Then the
possibility of further improving the tools will be
opened.
The use of data with automatically annotated
sentence structure in machine translation sys-
tem among related languages, as in Homola and
Kubon? (2008), is also foreseen.
