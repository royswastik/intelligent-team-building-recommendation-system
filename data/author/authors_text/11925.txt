Abstract 
One of the most common and persistent error 
types in second language writing is colloca-
tion errors, such as learn knowledge instead of 
gain or acquire knowledge, or make damage 
rather than cause damage.  In this work-in-
progress report, we propose a probabilistic 
model for suggesting corrections to lexical 
collocation errors. The probabilistic model in-
corporates three features: word association 
strength (MI), semantic similarity (via Word-
Net) and the notion of shared collocations (or 
intercollocability).  The results suggest that 
the combination of all three features outper-
forms any single feature or any combination 
of two features.  
1 Collocation in Language Learning  
The importance and difficulty of collocations for 
second language users has been widely acknowl-
edged and various sources of the difficulty put 
forth (Granger 1998, Nesselhauf 2004, Howarth 
1998, Liu 2002, inter alia). Liu?s study of a 4-
million-word learner corpus reveals that verb-noun 
(VN) miscollocations make up the bulk of the lexi-
cal collocation errors in learners? essays. Our study 
focuses, therefore, on VN miscollocation correc-
tion. 
2 Error Detection and Correction in NLP 
Error detection and correction have been two 
major issues in NLP research in the past decade. 
Projects involving learner corpora in analyzing and 
categorizing learner errors include NICT Japanese 
Learners of English (JLE), the Chinese Learners of 
English Corpus (Gamon et al, 2008) and English 
Taiwan Learner Corpus (or TLC) (Wible et al, 
2003). Studies that focus on providing automatic 
correction, however, mainly deal with errors that 
derive from closed-class words, such as articles 
(Han et al, 2004) and prepositions (Chodorow et 
al., 2007). One goal of this work-in-progress is to 
address the less studied issue of open class lexical 
errors, specifically lexical collocation errors. 
3 The Present Study 
We focus on providing correct collocation sug-
gestions for lexical miscollocations. Three features 
are employed to identify the correct collocation 
substitute for a miscollocation: word association 
measurement, semantic similarity between the cor-
rection candidate and the misused word to be re-
placed, and intercollocability (i.e., the concept of 
shared collocates in collocation clusters proposed 
by Cowie and Howarth, 1995). NLP research on 
learner errors includes work on error detection and 
error correction. While we are working on both, 
here we report specifically on our work on lexical 
miscollocation correction.  
4 Method  
We incorporate both linguistic and computa-
tional perspectives in our approach. 84 VN miscol-
locations from Liu?s (2002) study were employed 
as the training and the testing data in that each 
comprised 42 randomly chosen miscollocations. 
Two experienced English teachers1 manually went 
through the 84 miscollocations and provided a list 
of correction suggestions. Only when the system 
output matches to any of the suggestions offered

by the two annotators would the data be included 
in the result. The two main knowledge resources 
that we incorporated are British National Corpus2 
and WordNet (Miller, 1990). BNC was utilized to 
measure word association strength and to extract 
shared collocates while WordNet was used in de-
termining semantic similarity. Our probabilistic 
model that combines the features is described in 
sub-section 4.4. Note that all the 84 VN miscollo-
cations are combination of incorrect verbs and fo-
cal nouns, our approach is therefore aimed to find 
the correct verb replacements.  
4.1 Word Association Measurement 
The role of word association in miscollocation 
suggestions are twofold: 1. all suggested correct 
collocations in any case have to be identified as 
collocations; thus, we assume candidate replace-
ments for the miscollocate verbs must exceed a 
threshold word association strength with the focal 
noun; 2. we examine the possibility that the higher 
the word association score the more likely it is to 
be a correct substitute for the wrong collocate. We 
adopt Mutual Information (Church et al 1991) as 
our association measurement. 
4.2 Semantic Similarity 
Both Gitsaki et al (2000) and Liu (2002) sug-
gest a semantic relation holds between a miscollo-
cate and its correct counterpart. Following this, we 
assume that in the 84 miscollocations, the miscol-
locates should stand in more or less a semantic re-
lation with the corrections. For example, say in an 
attested learner miscollocation say story is found to 
be a synonym of the correct verb tell in WordNet. 
Based on this assumption, words that show some 
degree of semantic similarity with the miscollocate 
are considered possible candidates for replacing it. 
To measure similarity we take the synsets of 
WordNet to be nodes in a graph. We quantify the 
semantic similarity of the incorrect verb in a mis-
collocation with other possible substitute verbs by 
measuring graph-theoretic distance between the 
synset containing the miscollocate verb and the 
synset containing candidate substitutes. In cases of 
polysemy, we take the closest synsets for the dis-
tance measure. If the miscollocate and the candi-

date substitute occur in the same synset, then the 
distance between them is zero.   
The similarity measurement function is as fol-
lows (Tsao et al, 2003):

tween the synset  and  in WordNet hy-
per/hypo tree.   means the level number of s in 
hyper/hypo tree and the level of top node is 1. 
Multiplying  by 2 ensures the simi-
larity is less than 1. If   and  are synonymous, 
the similarity will be 1.

4.3 Shared Collocates in Collocation Clusters 
Futagi et al(2008) review several studies which 
adopt computational approaches in tackling collo-
cation errors; yet none of them, including Futagi et 
al., include the notion of collocation cluster. We 
borrow the cluster idea from Cowie & Howarth 
(1995) who propose ?overlapping cluster? to denote 
sets of collocations that carry similar meaning and 
shared collocates. Figure 1 represents a collocation 
cluster that expresses the concept of ?bringing 
something into actuality.? The key here is that not 
all VN combinations in Figure 1 are acceptable. 
While fulfill and achieve collocate with the four 
nouns on the right, realize does not collocate with 
purpose, as indicated by the dotted line. Cowie and 
Howarth?s point is that collocations that can be 
clustered via overlapping collocates can be the 
source of collocation errors for language learners. 
That both fulfill and reach collocate with goal and 
the further collocability of fulfill with ambition and 
purpose plausibly lead learners to assume that 
reach shares this collocability as well, leading by 
overgeneralization to the miscollocations reach an 
ambition or reach a purpose.

into actuality?

We employ the ideas of ?collocation cluster? and 
?shared collocates? in identifying correct counter-
parts to the miscollocations. Specifically, taking 
the miscollocation reach their purpose as a starting 
point, our system generates a collocation cluster by 
finding the verbs that collocate with purpose and 
nouns that reach collocates with. We consider this 
formed cluster the source that contains the possible 
correct replacement for reach in reach their pur-
pose. By finding verbs that not only collocate with 
purpose but also share the most other collocating 
nouns with the wrong verb reach, successfully, we 
identified candidate substitutes fulfill and achieve 
for the incorrect verb reach. 
4.4 Our Probabilistic Model 
The three features we described above are inte-
grated into a probabilistic model. Each feature is 
used to look up the correct collocation suggestion 
for a miscollocation. For instance, cause damage, 
one of the possible suggestions for the miscolloca-
tion make damage, is found to be ranked the 5th 
correction candidate by using word association 
measurement merely, the 2nd by semantic similarity 
and the 14th by using shared collocates. If we com-
bine the three features, however, cause damage is 
ranked first.  
The conditional probability of the case where 
the candidate is a correct one can be presented as: 
)( ,mcFverbcorrectaiscP   
where c means a candidate for a specific miscollo-
cation and Fc, m means the features values between 
m (misused words) and c (candidates). According 
to Bayes theorem and Bayes assumption, which 
assume that these features are independent, the 
probability can be computed by:

lar features. We use probability values to choose 
and rank the K-best suggestions.

5 Experimental Results  
Any found VN combination via our probabilistic 
approach was compared to the suggestions made 
by the two human experts. A match would be 
counted as a true positive. A discrete probability 
distribution is produced for each feature. We di-
vided feature value into five levels and obtained 
prior predicting value for each level of the three 
features. For example, we divided MI value to five 
levels (<1.5, 1.5~3.0, 3.0~4.5, 4.5~6, >6).  The five 
ranks for semantic similarity and normalized 
shared collocates number are 0.0~0.2, 0.2~0.4, 
0.4~0.6, 0.6~0.8 and 0.8 ~1.0. For every feature, 
we obtain a predicting value for each level after the 
training process. The predicting value is shown 
as ( )( )fP SfP c . In line with that, P(MI>6)  means the 
probability of all VN collocations retrieved from 
BNC in which the MI value is higher than 6 
whereas P(MI>6| ) shows the probability of  all 
correct VN collocations with the MI value higher 
than 6.

Different combinations of the three features are 
made on the basis of the probabilistic model de-
scribed in Section 4.4. Seven models derive from 
such combinations (See Table 1). Table 2 shows 
the precision of k-best suggestions for each model.

Table 2 shows that, considering the results for 
each feature run separately (M1-M3), the feature 
?semantic similarity? (M2) outperforms the other 
two. Among combined feature models (M4-M7), 
M7 (MI + SS+ SC), provides the highest propor-
tion of true positives at every value of k except k = 
1. The full hybrid of all three features (M7) outper-
forms any single feature. The best results are 
achieved when taking into account both statistical 
and semantic features. This is illustrated with re-
sults for the example get knowledge in Table 3 (the 
asterisks (*) indicate the true positives.) 
6 Conclusion 
In this report of work in progress, we present a 
probabilistic model that adopts word association 
measurement, semantic similarity and shared col-
locates in looking for corrections for learners? mis-
collocations. Although only VN miscollocations 
are examined, the model is designed to be applica-
ble to other types of miscollocations. Applying 
such mechanisms to other types of miscollocations 
as well as detecting miscollocations will be the 
next steps of this research. Further, a larger amount 
of miscollocations should be included in order to 
verify our approach and to address the issue of the 
small drop of the full-hybrid M7 at k=1.
