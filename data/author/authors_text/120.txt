Abstract 
Mapping between syntax and semantics is one
of the most promising research topics in cor-
pus annotation. This paper deals with the im-
plementation of an semi-automatic
transformation from a syntactically-tagged
corpus into a semantic-tagged one. The
method has been experimentally applied to a
1600-sentence treebank (the UAM Spanish
Treebank). Results of evaluation  are provided
as well as prospective work in comparing
syntax and semantics in written and spoken
annotated corpora.
1 Introduction
This paper presents a new stage in the development of
the UAM Spanish Treebank1 (syntactic annotation) and
of  SESCO2 (semantic annotation), based on possible
relationships between them. Our aim is to achieve semi-
automatic semantic tagging of the UAM Spanish Tree-
bank. To reach this goal, we have developed and im-
plemented a program called SST (Syntax Semantics
Transformation). The application of this tool provides
us with three main benefits:
First and foremost, our principal concern is a reli-
able, quick and cost effective tagging of the treebank.
Manual annotation would be time consuming and ex-
pensive because of the complexity of the sentences. On
the other hand, automatic processing ensures coherence
and control over the tagging: each type will be tagged
                                                                
  The research of Manuel Alc?ntara has been supported
by a grant of the Spanish Ministerio de Educaci?n y Ciencia
(FPU).

always with the same structure. Our previous experience
in developing the UAM Spanish Treebank has led us to
this approach.
Second, this experiment contributes to the study of
the relationship between syntax and semantics showing
that an almost automatic transition from one level to
another is possible. The idea of the connection between
these levels of the language is a commonplace in con-
temporary linguistics and there are important theoretical
works concerning the mapping between morpho-
syntactic and semantic forms. However these theories
have not yet been applied to corpora. Indeed, we are not
aware of any similar experiments.
Finally, through this research we have developed a
set of grammatical rules connecting syntactic structures
to their correspondent event types. It is worth mention-
ing here that we have worked with corpora with no the-
matic restrictions. Therefore, these rules are not thought
for a particular sublanguage, but applicable to Spanish
language in general.
2 UAM Spanish Treebank and SESCO
In order to understand the SST, it is interesting to
consider the characteristics of the corpora we have used.
2.1 UAM Spanish Treebank (source corpus).
The UAM Spanish Treebank of the Universidad
Aut?noma de Madrid is a syntactically annotated corpus
made up of 1600 sentences taken from Spanish
newspapers (Moreno et al, 1999; Moreno et al, 2003).
 Since these sentences (particularly the first 500)
were chosen as a sample of the complexity of Spanish
syntax, they cover an important range of syntactic
structures. The fact that the sample was taken
selectively from different sections of the sources
reflecting different styles implies much more
complexity.
The format was based on the Penn Treebank, al-
though the tag set has been adapted to the characteristics
of the Spanish language. The corpus has recently been
converted to an XML format, which has helped us a lot
in our work.
The Treebank has four different types of informa-
tion:
1. Part-of-Speech (noun, verb, etc.)
2. Syntactic functions (SUBJ, DO, ATTR, etc.)
3. Morpho-syntactic features (gender, number,
person, etc.)
4. Semantic features. The UAM Spanish Treebank
has a group of tags called ?semantic features?
which specify types of prepositional phrases
(locative, time, etc.)
The aim of this annotation was to reflect the sur-
face syntax. The designers were thus very cautious in
regards to empty categories and ambiguities: they used
the features only in those cases with the highest cer-
tainty. Additionally,, the designers avoided redundancy
as much as possible.
The Treebank tag set has a flexible design allow-
ing the addition of new features. However as more fea-
tures are added, annotation becomes more difficult,
since the human tagger has to choose the suitable tag
among the available ones.
2.2 SESCO (target corpus).
SESCO is a tagging system which allows the semantic
representation of a linguistic corpus (Alc?ntara, 2003).
It is coded using an XML markup and offers a practical
basis for tagging both spoken and written corpora.
The main goal of SESCO is to make an essential
and flexible analysis for extracting the largest possible
amount of data from a corpus without limiting it to an
excessively restrictive theory, taking the argument
structure of verbs as starting-point.
We back J.C. Moreno's proposal (J.C. Moreno
1991a, 1991b, 1997) on event analysis, although we
also have considered other very similar approaches
(Pustejovsky, 1995; Tenny and Pustejovsky, 2000).
The events expressed by verbs can be of three
major types, forming a universal hierarchy (J.C. Mo-
reno, 1997):  states, processes and actions. These three
types are divided into subtypes according to the argu-
ments they require.
This approach is compositional: a state has two ar-
guments, a process is made up of a transition from one
state to another, and an action is a process with an
agent. This leads to the logical consequence that we
need an annotation format for representing both the re-
lation between events and the arguments of the sentence
and its sub-event structure.
Most of the recent work on semantics focuses on
ontologies. It is important to distinguish the fact that
SESCO does not have an ontology as a basis, but that
the ontology can be a result of our work.
SESCO has been developed taking as point of ref-
erence the spoken corpus from the Computational Lin-
guistics Laboratory of the Universidad Aut?noma de
Madrid (http://www.lllf.uam.es/), which, in turn, forms
part of the European project "C-ORAL-ROM"
(http://lablita.dit.unifi.it/coralrom/). Texts have been
recorded following requirements of spontaneity, quality
of the sound and variety of speakers and contexts.
At the beginning of our experiment, 49500 sponta-
neous spoken words (4100 sentences) had been ana-
lyzed in SESCO format. These sentences are our
training corpus and the basis of our SESCO Data Base
(SDB) of event structures.
2.3 Main differences.
Besides the linguistic background, there are three main
differences between the syntactically annotated UAM
Treebank and SESCO:
First, whereas the Treebank is a corpus of written
texts, SESCO contains only spontaneous speech ortho-
grafic transcriptions. As we expected, the vocabulary
was not the same and the upshot of this was an increase
in the number of unknown lemmas. In actual fact, both
corpora are designed for covering a wide range of topics
and registers.
Second, the UAM Treebank tagset is far more
complex than that of SESCO. In this respect, the SST
process is a reduction and it does not use all the features
included in the Treebank. Syntactic functions and some
semantic features are the only information that SST
makes use of.
Finally, SST raises fundamental questions on the
concept of ?sentence?. In the Treebank, the key is the
orthography: the limits of a sentence are always estab-
lished by dots. In SESCO, a sentence is a complete
event. Because of this, the 1600 sentences of the UAM
Spanish Treebank corpus produce 1666 sentences in the
SESCO version. In spite of this, orthographic punctua-
tion has been helpful in the task of recognizing the be-
ginning of most of the sentences.

3 Methodology
The input is a syntactically annotated sentence and the
output is the same sentence semantically tagged. Both
annotations are in XML and the involves five main
stages. The first three stages are automatic, imple-
mented in Perl. The fourth (optional) stage is semi-
automatic and the last one is a human-revision.
3.1 Getting the event type.
As pointed out earlier, our semantic tagging reflects
argument structures related to verbs. Due to this
theoretical framework, the first step is to find the lemma
of the main verb. It is an easy task since the treebank
format provides this information through a particular
attribute ("lemma") in the element "verb".
Once the lemma is found, the program searches the
SDB for the most frequent event type for this lemma.
This selection is made taking into account the syntactic
structure: for example, if it is a process and there is a
locative complement, the most used displacement will
be chosen.
The SDB data come from the previous analysis (for
more details about the SESCO corpus, see section 2.2.).
That is, this stage is based on a probabilistic model and
the automatic mapping is example-based, finding
similar examples already in the training corpus.
3.2 From a syntactic structure to a semantic
analysis.
In order to understand this second step, first of all it is
necessary to remark on some characteristics of the
UAM Spanish Treebank. When the UAM Treebank was
designed in 1997 (Moreno et al, 2003), the aim was
only to build a syntactically annotated corpus following
the Penn Treebank style ? no consideration was given to
the possibility of its translation into a semantic corpus.
Therefore the Treebank included only those features
needed for achieving a correct syntactic analysis. As
mentioned above, the UAM Spanish Treebank uses the
standard Penn Treebank scheme with the addition of
some features. It provides a combination of Part of
Speech information with specific grammatical features
of words and phrases.
In SST, this syntactic data is transformed into an
event analysis through application of a set of rules. Each
rule corresponds to the most frequent correlation be-
tween a syntactic phrase and a part of the event struc-
ture. Some of the rules are general, but others depend on
the lemma. In the current version, lemmas are classified
into six different groups:
1. Standard-Type. The rules are consistent with
most of the lemmas. By way of illustration,
these rules transform the subject (SUBJ) of a
sentence, which corresponds to an action, into
the agent, and the direct object (DO) into the
patient. If the event type is a state, the SUBJ
will be the first argument of the state and the
attribute will be the second argument. There is
a subset of rules for passive sentences.
2. First-Type-Actions. The rules transform the
indirect object (IO) into the patient. For in-
stance, ?pegar? (to hit).
3. Second-Type-Actions. The IO is transformed
into the first argument of the states. For in-
stance, ?devolver? (to give back ).
4. Third-Type-Actions.  The DO is transformed
into the second argument of the states. For in-
stance, ?otorgar? (to grant).
5. First-Type-States. The IO is transformed with
the second argument of the states. For in-
stance, ?gustar? (to like).
6. Second-Type-States. The second argument of
the state is a prepositional phrase. For in-
stance, ?coincidir con? (to coincide with).
3.3 References and variables.
Lemmas of complex events (specifically actions) are
classified additionally depending on their references.
References are used in SESCO in order to link the
arguments of an event with their functions in the
arguments of sub-events. As we have seen in section
2.2, SESCO is based on a compositional semantic
theory  where actions and processes are made up of sub-
events. These references are determined in the case of
actions by five different types of lemmas.
Those parts of the event structure which have no
correspondence with a phrase (for instance, the agent in
a sentence without explicit SUBJ) are filled with vari-
ables by the program.
3.4 Unknown lemmas.
As mentioned, the method requires a database with pre-
vious examples, something which is not available for all
the potential lemmas of a language. In case the program
could not reach a model for a lemma, it prompts the user
for the most basic information and tries to carry out the
analysis. By this means, the final file contains all the
sentences in SESCO format with the most likely struc-
ture.
Since SESCO has a DTD-controlled tagset cover-
ing all possible analysis, the output file will always be a
well formed and valid XML file.
3.5 Revision.
The last step is a manual revision of the output file. As
we have used the tagging of the UAM Spanish
Treebank in order to develop our system, this step has a
great importance.
The program errors detected during the analisys
have served us to implement new rules. That is why the
corpus has been tagged in small groups of sentences
(with approx. 100 sentences each group).
When an error is detected during the analysis,
typically a new rule is added. For this reason,  the
corpus has been tagged in small groups of sentences
(with approx. 100 sentences each group). Thus, we have
performed sixteen re-examinations of our system each
time re-testing the reliability of the rules.
Once the revision is completed, the new sentences
are added to the SDB.
4 Main problems for SST.
The last step of the SST process, the revision, provides
us with a typology of problems in the automatic part of
the system. Let us look at the four most important types
and at the number of errors in the 1666 sentences:
Total

Missing
lemmas

Type
False

Total
1666 69 71 66 53 259
100% 4.14% 4.26% 4% 3.18% 15.58%
Table 2. Error typology
1. Sentences without lemmas (69 errors).
Newspapers have a lot of sentences (words
between dots) which do not have a verb.
Nominalization is frequently used by jour-
nalists with pragmatic functions. Taking
into account that we are analysing argu-
ment structures of verbs, this sentence
serves to illustrate this error: ?Medidas
desesperadas en China para frenar la
crecida del Yangtz? en la provincia de
Hubei.? (?Tough measures in China to
stop the Yangzte overflow in Hubei?).
2. Verb Type (71 errors). The analysis of the
verb is not correct because it is not in its
right group (see section 3.2.). When the
SST program does not recognize a lemma,
it asks for the essential information, but it
does not ask for types of references.
3. False analysis (66 errors). The most likely
analysis (according to the SDB) does not
correspond to the sentence. Since we are
still developing SESCO, it would be na?ve
to suppose that all these errors are due to
SST problems. As we have seen, the SDB
is based on a small corpus of 49500 words
and they are not enough to get the most
likely structure of some verbs (some of
which have appeared only once or have
not appeared at all).
4. Treebank errors (53 errors). We began our
work with the last 100 sentences of the
UAM Spanish Treebank (sentences 1500-
1600). We have done it in this inverse or-
der because Manuel Alc?ntara had anno-
tated himself the last sentences of the
Treebank. In this process, we have noticed
differences between the analysis of the
sentences. These differences, even though
they are not important for the syntactic
analysis, have hindered the SST process
since our program expects a particular
structure. With the help of SST, we now
have a revised version of the syntactic
Treebank.
In addition to these errors, there are others which
we have not considered so important because they do
not change the event type.
The rules for the indirect relations (those phrases
which are not arguments of the verb) depend on the
semantic features of the Treebank tagset and they are
not always enough to determine the right tag. It is worth
remembering that both systems (Treebank and SESCO)
are designed independently.
Telicity of events is determined by the (indefi-
nite/definite) articles of the phrases. When the head of a
phrase is not at the very beginning, errors can occur.
5 Examples.
Let us point out an uncomplicated example of the SST
process: ?EEUU tiene ya pistas sobre el doble atentado
en Kenia y Tanzania  .? (?The United States already has
a lead about the terrorist outrage of Kenya and Tanza-
nia?).
First of all, SST searches for the main verb and its
lemma. In this case, the verb is ?tiene? (has) and the
lemma is ?tener? (to have). The Treebank tag for this
verb is:
<V Lemma="tener" Tensed="Yes" Form="PRES"
Mode="IND" Number="SG" P="3">tiene</V>
From this starting-point, SST looks for the most
likely structure of ?tener? in the SDB. 99.5% of ?tener?
events are attributive states with a possessor and a prop-
erty.
The program checks if ?tener? belongs to a special
verb type. It does not, so the program checks if it is a
normal sentence (it is not in passive voice) and follows
the standard rules. These rules are the following:
1. The subject of the sentence (?EEUU?) is the
possessor.
2. If there is an attributive phrase or a direct object,
it is the property. If there is not, the program
looks for other possibilities (oblique comple-
ment, predicative complement, clauses and
prepositional phrases). In our example, ?pistas
sobre el doble atentado en Kenia y Tanzania? is
tagged as direct object.
3. In case no possessor or property was found, SST
would assign a variable to these arguments.
4. The program checks if the arguments are defi-
nite or indefinite. ?Pistas? is  indefinite and
SST sets the event as indefinite.
5. Finally, SST looks for indirect relations (prepo-
sitional phrases which are not arguments).
Once these rules are applied, the program deter-
mines if it is a negative sentence, a question, etc. by
means of looking for negative words and punctuation,
and sets the appropriate features. It also determines the
tense.
At the end, the final version of the sentence analysis is
written in a target file following the SESCO format.
To take a more difficult example, let us analyze the
sentence ?Se ha escapado de casa? (?He/she has escaped
from his/her home?). We have only one previous analy-
sis of the lemma ?escaparse? (to escape) in SDB and it
is an action made up of a displacement.
Regarding references, ?Escaparse? belongs in a par-
ticular group of events together with ?ir?, ?irrumpir?,
?marchar?, ?presentarse?, etc. For this group, the agent
and patient of the action and the first argument of the
displacement?s states are the same entity.
The SST checks if it is a normal sentence and fol-
lows the fitting rules for this group:
1. The subject of the sentence will be the agent. In
this case, there is no subject and the program
establishes a variable (X) chosen arbitrarily.
2. Because it is a displacement, SST looks for
prepositional phrases with ?de? or ?desde?
(?from?) in order to fill the second argument of
the first state. It finds ?de casa?.
3. SST looks for prepositional phrases with ?a? or
?hasta? (?to?) in order to fill the second argu-
ment of the second state. It does not find it.
4. The program establishes a number as identifier
of the agent and links it together with the pa-
tient and the first arguments of the states.
5. SST looks for indirect relations.
At last, the program determines that it is not a nega-
tive sentence and gets time and mood information.
The annotated sentence in Treebank and SESCO
formats can be found in appendix. Most important data
is underlined.
6 Future work.
Once we have the UAM Spanish Treebank semantically
annotated, we would like to compare the data from both
spontaneous speech and written corpora.
In a first comparison, we found that actions are the
most frequent event type in our written corpus while
states are the most frequent in the spoken one.

Table 3 Event type comparison
In addition, we are trying to carry out a reverse SST
process for achieving a syntactic tagging based on our
semantic schemes. On the first stage, we have added
morphological information (POS and grammar features
as genre, number, etc.) to our SESCO corpora. We want
to explore this and other features in future work.
