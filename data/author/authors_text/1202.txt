Abstract
The performance of automatic speech
summarisation has been improved in pre-
vious experiments by using linguistic
model adaptation. We extend such adapta-
tion to the use of class models, whose ro-
bustness further improves summarisation
performance on a wider variety of objec-
tive evaluation metrics such as ROUGE-2
and ROUGE-SU4 used in the text sum-
marisation literature. Summaries made
from automatic speech recogniser tran-
scriptions benefit from relative improve-
ments ranging from 6.0% to 22.2% on all
investigated metrics.
1 Introduction
Techniques for automatically summarising written
text have been actively investigated in the field of
natural language processing, and more recently new
techniques have been developed for speech sum-
marisation (Kikuchi et al, 2003). However it is
still very hard to obtain good quality summaries.
Moreover, recognition accuracy is still around 30%
on spontaneous speech tasks, in contrast to speech
read from text such as broadcast news. Spontaneous
speech is characterised by disfluencies, repetitions,
repairs, and fillers, all of which make recognition
and consequently speech summarisation more diffi-
cult (Zechner, 2002). In a previous study (Chatain
et al, 2006), linguistic model (LiM) adaptation us-
ing different types of word models has proved use-
ful in order to improve summary quality. However
sparsity of the data available for adaptation makes it
difficult to obtain reliable estimates of word n-gram
probabilities. In speech recognition, class models
are often used in such cases to improve model ro-
bustness. In this paper we extend the work previ-
ously done on adapting the linguistic model of the
speech summariser by investigating class models.
We also use a wider variety of objective evaluation
metrics to corroborate results.
2 Summarisation Method
The summarisation system used in this paper is es-
sentially the same as the one described in (Kikuchi
et al, 2003), which involves a two step summarisa-
tion process, consisting of sentence extraction and
sentence compaction. Practically, only the sentence
extraction part was used in this paper, as prelimi-
nary experiments showed that compaction had little
impact on results for the data used in this study.
Important sentences are first extracted accord-
ing to the following score for each sentence
W = w1, w2, ..., wn, obtained from the automatic
speech recognition output:
S(W ) =
1
N
N?
i=1
{?CC(wi)+?II(wi)+?LL(wi)},
(1)
where N is the number of words in the sentence
W , and C(wi), I(wi) and L(wi) are the confidence
score, the significance score and the linguistic score
of word wi, respectively. ?C , ?I and ?L are the
respective weighting factors of those scores, deter-
mined experimentally.
For each word from the automatic speech recogni-
21
tion transcription, a logarithmic value of its posterior
probability, the ratio of a word hypothesis probabil-
ity to that of all other hypotheses, is calculated using
a word graph obtained from the speech recogniser
and used as a confidence score.
For the significance score, the frequencies of oc-
currence of 115k words were found using the WSJ
and the Brown corpora.
In the experiments in this paper we modified the
linguistic component to use combinations of dif-
ferent linguistic models. The linguistic component
gives the linguistic likelihood of word strings in
the sentence. Starting with a baseline LiM (LiMB)
we perform LiM adaptation by linearly interpolat-
ing the baseline model with other component mod-
els trained on different data. The probability of a
given n-gram sequence then becomes:
P (wi|wi?n+1..wi?1) = ?1P1(wi|wi?n+1..wi?1)
+... + ?nPn(wi|wi?n+1..wi?1), (2)
where
?
k ?k = 1 and ?k and Pk are the weight and
the probability assigned by model k.
In the case of a two-sided class-based model,
Pk(wi|wi?n+1..wi?1) = Pk(wi|C(wi)) ?
Pk(C(wi)|C(wi?n+1)..C(wi?1)), (3)
where Pk(wi|C(wi)) is the probability of the
word wi belonging to a given class C, and
Pk(C(wi)|C(wi?n+1)..C(wi?1)) the probability of
a certain word class C(wi) to appear after a history
of word classes, C(wi?n+1), ..., C(wi?1).
Different types of component LiM are built, com-
ing from different sources of data, either as word
or class models. The LiMB and component LiMs
are then combined for adaptation using linear inter-
polation as in Equation (2). The linguistic score is
then computed using this modified probability as in
Equation (4):
L(wi) = logP (wi|wi?n+1..wi?1). (4)
3 Evaluation Criteria
3.1 Summarisation Accuracy
To automatically evaluate the summarised speeches,
correctly transcribed talks were manually sum-
marised, and used as the correct targets for evalua-
tion. Variations of manual summarisation results are
merged into a word network, which is considered to
approximately express all possible correct summari-
sations covering subjective variations. The word ac-
curacy of automatic summarisation is calculated as
the summarisation accuracy (SumACCY) using the
word network (Hori et al, 2003):
Accuracy = (Len?Sub?Ins?Del)/Len?100[%],
(5)
where Sub is the number of substitution errors, Ins
is the number of insertion errors, Del is the number
of deletion errors, and Len is the number of words
in the most similar word string in the network.
3.2 ROUGE
Version 1.5.5 of the ROUGE scoring algorithm
(Lin, 2004) is also used for evaluating results.
ROUGE F-measure scores are given for ROUGE-
2 (bigram), ROUGE-3 (trigram), and ROUGE-SU4
(skip-bigram), using the model average (average
score across all references) metric.
4 Experimental Setup
Experiments were performed on spontaneous
speech, using 9 talks taken from the Translanguage
English Database (TED) corpus (Lamel et al, 1994;
Wolfel and Burger, 2005), each transcribed and
manually summarised by nine different humans for
both 10% and 30% summarization ratios. Speech
recognition transcriptions (ASR) were obtained for
each talk, with an average word error rate of 33.3%.
A corpus consisting of around ten years of con-
ference proceedings (17.8M words) on the subject
of speech and signal processing is used to generate
the LiMB and word classes using the clustering al-
gorithm in (Ney et al, 1994).
Different types of component LiM are built and
combined for adaptation as described in Section 2.
The first type of component linguistic models are
built on the small corpus of hand-made summaries
described above, made for the same summarisation
ratio as the one we are generating. For each talk
the hand-made summaries of the other eight talks
(i.e. 72 summaries) were used as the LiM training
corpus. This type of LiM is expected to help gener-
ate automatic summaries in the same style as those
made manually.

The second type of component linguistic models
are built from the papers in the conference proceed-
ings for the talk we want to summarise. This type
of LiM, used for topic adaptation, is investigated be-
cause key words and important sentences that appear
in the associated paper are expected to have a high
information value and should be selected during the
summarisation process.
Three sets of experiments were made: in the first
experiment (referred to as Word), LiMB and both
component models are word models, as introduced
in (Chatain et al, 2006). For the second one (Class),
both LiMB and the component models are class
models built using exactly the same data as the word
models. For the third experiment (Mixed), the LiMB
is an interpolation of class and word models, while
the component LiMs are class models.
To optimise use of the available data, a rotating
form of cross-validation (Duda and Hart, 1973) is
used: all talks but one are used for development, the
remaining talk being used for testing. Summaries
from the development talks are generated automati-
cally by the system using different sets of parameters
and the LiMB . These summaries are evaluated and
the set of parameters which maximises the develop-
ment score for the LiMB is selected for the remain-
ing talk. The purpose of the development phase is
to choose the most effective combination of weights
?C , ?I and ?L. The summary generated for each
talk using its set of optimised parameters is then
evaluated using the same metric, which gives us our
baseline for this talk. Using the same parameters as
those that were selected for the baseline, we gener-
ate summaries for the lectures in the development set
for different LiM interpolation weights ?k. Values
between 0 and 1 in steps of 0.1, were investigated
for the latter, and an optimal set of ?k is selected.
Using these interpolation weights, as well as the set
of parameters determined for the baseline, we gen-
erate a summary of the test talk, which is evaluated
using the same evaluation metric, giving us our fi-
nal adapted result for this talk. Averaging those re-
sults over the test set (i.e. all talks) gives us our final
adapted result.
This process is repeated for all evaluation metrics,
and all three experiments (Word, Class, and Mixed).
Lower bound results are given by random sum-
marisation (Random) i.e. randomly extracting sen-
tences and words, without use of the scores present
in Equation (1) for appropriate summarisation ratios.
5 Results
5.1 TRS Results
Initial experiments were made on the human tran-
scriptions (TRS), and results are given in Table 1.
Experiments on word models (Word) show relative
improvements in terms of SumACCY of 7.5% and
2.1% for the 10% and 30% summarisation ratios, re-
spectively. ROUGE metrics, however, do not show
any significant improvement.
Using class models (Class and Mixed), for all
ROUGE metrics, relative improvements range from
3.5% to 13.4% for the 10% summarisation ratio, and
from 8.6% to 16.5% on the 30% summarisation ra-
tio. For SumACCY, relative improvements between
11.5% to 12.9% are observed.
5.2 ASR Results
ASR results for each experiment are given in Ta-
ble 2 for appropriate summarisation ratios. As for

the TRS, LiM adaptation showed improvements in
terms of SumACCY, but ROUGE metrics do not cor-
roborate those results for the 10% summarisation ra-
tio. Using class models, for all ROUGE metrics, rel-
ative improvements range from 6.0% to 22.2% and
from 7.4% to 20.0% for the 10% and 30% summari-
sation ratios, respectively. SumACCY relative im-
provements range from 7.6% to 15.9%.
6 Discussion
Compared to previous experiments using only word
models, improvements obtained using class models
are larger and more significant for both ROUGE and
SumACCY metrics. This can be explained by the
fact that the data we are performing adaptation on
is very sparse, and that the nine talks used in these
experiments are quite different from each other, es-
pecially since the speakers also vary in style. Class
models are more robust to this spontaneous speech
aspect than word models, since they generalise bet-
ter to unseen word sequences.
There is little difference between the Class and
Mixed results, since the development phase assigned
most weight to the class model component in the
Mixed experiment, making the results quite similar
to those of the Class experiment.
7 Conclusion
In this paper we have investigated linguistic model
adaptation using different sources of data for an au-
tomatic speech summarisation system. Class mod-
els have proved to be much more robust than word
models for this process, and relative improvements
ranging from 6.0% to 22.2% were obtained on a va-
riety of evaluation metrics on summaries generated
from automatic speech recogniser transcriptions.
