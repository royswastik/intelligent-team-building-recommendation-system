Abstract
This paper explores corpus-based bilingual re-
trieval where the translation corpora used vary
by source and size. We find that the quality of
translation alignments and the domain of the
bitext are important. In some settings these
factors are more critical than corpus size. We
also show that judicious choice of tokeniza-
tion can reduce the amount of bitext required
to obtain good bilingual retrieval performance.
1 Introduction
Large parallel corpora are an increasingly available
commodity. Such texts are the fuel of statistical
machine translation systems and are used in appli-
cations such as cross-language information retrieval
(CLIR). Several beliefs are commonly held regard-
ing the relationship between parallel text quality and
size for CLIR. It is thought that larger texts should
be better, because the problems of data sparseness
and untranslatable terms are reduced. Similarly, par-
allel text from a domain more closely related to a
document collection should lead to better bilingual
retrieval performance, again because better lexical
translations are available.
We compared four sources of parallel text us-
ing CLEF document collections in eight languages
(Braschler and Peters, 2004). English topic sets
from 2000 to 2007 were used. Corpus-based trans-
lation of query terms was performed and documents
were ranked using a statistical language model ap-
proach to retrieval (Ponte and Croft, 1998). Exper-
iments were conducted using unlemmatized words
and character 5-grams. No use was made of pre-
translation query expansion or automated relevance
feedback.
2 Translation Corpora
Information about the four parallel texts used in our
experiments is provided in Table 1. We restricted
our focus to Dutch (NL), English (EN), Finnish (FI),
French (FR), German (DE), Italian (IT), Portuguese
(PT), Spanish (ES), and Swedish (SV). These lan-
guages are covered by each parallel corpus.
2.1 Bible
The bible corpus is based on the 66 books in the Old
and New Testaments. Alignments at the verse level
were used; there are 31103 verses in the English text.
2.2 JRC-Acquis v3
This parallel text is based on EU laws comprising the
Acquis Communautaire and translations are avail-
able in 22 languages. The English portion of the
acquis data includes 1.2 million aligned passages
containing over 32 million words, which is approxi-
mately 40 times larger than the Biblical text. Align-
ments were provided with the corpus and were pro-
duced by the Vanilla algorithm.1 The alignments are
at roughly the sentence level, but only 85% corre-
spond to a single sentence in both languages.
2.3 Europarl v3
The Europarl corpus was assembled to support ex-
periments in statistical machine translation (Koehn,
2005). The documents consist of transcribed dia-
logue from the official proceedings of the European
Parliament. We used the precomputed alignments
that are provided with the corpus, and which are
based on the algorithm by Gale and Church (1991).
The alignments are believed to be of high quality.

2.4 Official Journal of the EU
The Official Journal of the European Union covers a
wide range of topics such as agriculture, trade, and
foreign relations. We constructed this parallel cor-
pus by downloading documents dating from January
1998 through April 2004 and converting the texts
from Adobe?s Portable Document Format (PDF) to
ISO-8859-1 encoded text using pdftotext. The doc-
uments were segmented into pages and into para-
graphs consisting of a small number of sentences
(typically 1 to 3); however this process was compli-
cated by the fact that many documents have outline
or tabular formatting. Alignments were produced
using Church?s char align software (1993).
Due to complexities of decoding the PDF, some of
the accented characters were not extracted properly,
but this is a problem mostly for the earlier material
in the collection. In total about 85 million words of
text per language was obtained, which is over twice
the size of either the acquis or europarl collections.
3 Translation
Using the pairwise-aligned corpora described above,
parallel indexes for each corpus were created using
words and 5-grams. Query translation was accom-
plished as follows. For each query term s, source
language documents from the aligned collection that
contain s are identified. If no document contains this
term, then it is left untranslated. Each target lan-
guage term t appearing in the corresponding docu-
ments is scored:
Score(t) = (Fl(t)? Fc(t))? IDF (t)1.25 (1)
where Fl and Fc are relative document frequencies
based on local subset of documents and the whole
corpus. IDF (t) is the inverse document frequency,
or log2( Ndf(t)). The candidate translation with thehighest score replaced the original query term and
the transformed query vector is used for retrieval
against the target language collection.
This is a straightforward approach to query trans-
lation. More sophisticated methods have been pro-
posed, including bidirectional translation (Wang and
Oard, 2006) and use of more than one translation
candidate per query term (Pirkola et al, 2003).
Subword translation, the direct translation of
character n-grams, offers several advantages over
translating words (McNamee and Mayfield, 2005).
N-grams provide morphological normalization,
translations of multiword expressions are suggested
by translation of word-spanning n-grams, and out-
of-vocabulary (OOV) words can be be partly trans-
lated with n-gram fragments. Additionally, there are
few OOV n-grams, at least for n = 4 and n = 5.
4 Experimental Results
We describe two experiments. The first examines
the efficacy of the different translation resources and
the second measures the relationship between cor-
pus size and retrieval effectiveness. English was the
sole source language.
4.1 Translation Resources
First the relationship between translation source and
bilingual retrieval effectiveness is studied. Table 2
reports mean average precision when word-based to-
kenization and translation was performed for each
of the target collections. For comparison the cor-
responding performance using topics in the target
language (mono) is also given. As expected, the
smallest bitext, bible, performs the worst. Averaged
across the eight languages only 39% relative effec-
tiveness is seen compared to monolingual perfor-
mance. Reports advocating the use of religious texts
for general purpose CLIR may have been overly op-
timistic (Chew et al, 2006). Both acquis and eu-
roparl are roughly 40 times larger in size than bible

and both do significantly better; however europarl is
clearly superior and achieves 75% of monolingual
effectiveness. Though nearly twice the size, ojeu
fails to outperform europarl and just barely beats
acquis. Likely reasons for this include difficulties
properly converting the ojeu data to text, problem-
atic alignments, and the substantially greater length
of the aligned passages.
The same observations can be seen from Table 3
where 5-grams were used for tokenization and trans-
lation instead of words. The level of performance
with 5-grams is higher and these improvements are
statistically significant with p < 0.01 (t-test).2 Av-
eraged across the eight languages gains from 30% to
47% were seen using 5-grams, depending on the re-
source. As a translation resource europarl still out-
performs the other sources in each of the eight lan-
guages and the relative ordering of {europarl, ojeu,
acquis, bible} is the same in both cases.
2Except in four cases: mono: In ES & IT p < 0.05; bible:
5-grams were not significantly different than words in FI & SV
4.2 Size of Parallel Text
To investigate how corpus size effects bilingual
retrieval we subsampled europarl and used these
smaller subcorpora for translation. The entire cor-
pus is 33 million words in size, and samples of 1%,
2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% were made
based on counting documents, which for europarl
is equivalent to counting sentences. Samples were
taken by processing the data in chronological order.
In Figure 1 (a-d) the effect of using larger parallel
corpora is plotted for four languages. Mean average
precision is on the vertical axes, and for visual effect
the chart for each language pair uses the same scale.
The general shape of the curves is to rise quickly as
increasing subsets from 1% to 10% are used and to
flatten as size increases further. Curves for the other
four languages (not shown) are quite similar. The
deceleration of improvement with increasing cor-
pus size can be explained by Heap?s Law. Similar
results have been obtained in the few studies that
have sought to quantify bilingual retrieval perfor-
mance as a function of translation resource size (Xu
and Weischedel, 2000; Demner-Fushman and Oard,
2003). In the higher complexity languages such as
German and Finnish, n-grams appear to be gaining
a slight improvement even when the entire corpus is
used; vocabulary size is greater in those languages.
The data for the 0% condition were based on
cognate matches for words and ?cognate n-grams?
that require no translation. The figure reveals that
even very small amounts of parallel text quickly im-
prove performance. The 2% condition is roughly the
size of bible, but is higher performing, likely due
to a better domain match.3 Using a subsample of
only 5% of available data from the highest perform-
ing translation resource, europarl, 5-grams outper-
formed plain words using any amount of bitext.
5 Conclusion
We examined issues in corpus-based bilingual re-
trieval, including the importance of parallel corpus
selection and size, and the relative effectiveness of
alternative tokenization methods. Size is not the
only important factor in corpus-based bilingual re-
3For example, the Biblical text does not contain the words
nuclear or energy and thus is greatly disadvantaged for a topic
about nuclear power.

trieval, the quality of alignments, compatibility in
genre, and choice of tokenization are also important.
We found that character 5-gram tokenization out-
performs words when used both for translation and
document indexing. Large relative improvements
(over 30%) were observed with 5-grams, and when
only limited parallel data is available for translation,
n-grams are markedly more effective than words.
Future work could address some limitations of the
present study by using bidirectional translation mod-
els, considering other language families and source
languages other than English, and applying query
expansion techniques.
