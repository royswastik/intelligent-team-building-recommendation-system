Abstract
Generalized Vector Space Models
(GVSM) extend the standard Vector
Space Model (VSM) by embedding addi-
tional types of information, besides terms,
in the representation of documents. An
interesting type of information that can
be used in such models is semantic infor-
mation from word thesauri like WordNet.
Previous attempts to construct GVSM
reported contradicting results. The most
challenging problem is to incorporate the
semantic information in a theoretically
sound and rigorous manner and to modify
the standard interpretation of the VSM.
In this paper we present a new GVSM
model that exploits WordNet?s semantic
information. The model is based on a new
measure of semantic relatedness between
terms. Experimental study conducted
in three TREC collections reveals that
semantic information can boost text
retrieval performance with the use of the
proposed GVSM.
1 Introduction
The use of semantic information into text retrieval
or text classification has been controversial. For
example in Mavroeidis et al (2005) it was shown
that a GVSM using WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)
senses and their hypernyms, improves text clas-
sification performance, especially for small train-
ing sets. In contrast, Sanderson (1994) reported
that even 90% accurate WSD cannot guarantee
retrieval improvement, though their experimental
methodology was based only on randomly gen-
erated pseudowords of varying sizes. Similarly,
Voorhees (1993) reported a drop in retrieval per-
formance when the retrieval model was based on
WSD information. On the contrary, the construc-
tion of a sense-based retrieval model by Stokoe
et al (2003) improved performance, while sev-
eral years before, Krovetz and Croft (1992) had
already pointed out that resolving word senses can
improve searches requiring high levels of recall.
In this work, we argue that the incorporation
of semantic information into a GVSM retrieval
model can improve performance by considering
the semantic relatedness between the query and
document terms. The proposed model extends
the traditional VSM with term to term relatedness
measured with the use of WordNet. The success of
the method lies in three important factors, which
also constitute the points of our contribution: 1) a
new measure for computing semantic relatedness
between terms which takes into account relation
weights, and senses? depth; 2) a new GVSM re-
trieval model, which incorporates the aforemen-
tioned semantic relatedness measure; 3) exploita-
tion of all the semantic information a thesaurus
can offer, including semantic relations crossing
parts of speech (POS). Experimental evaluation
in three TREC collections shows that the pro-
posed model can improve in certain cases the
performance of the standard TF-IDF VSM. The
rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section
2 presents preliminary concepts, regarding VSM
and GVSM. Section 3 presents the term seman-
tic relatedness measure and the proposed GVSM.
Section 4 analyzes the experimental results, and
Section 5 concludes and gives pointers to future
work.
2 Background
2.1 Vector Space Model
The VSM has been a standard model of represent-
ing documents in information retrieval for almost
three decades (Salton and McGill, 1983; Baeza-
Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999). Let D be a docu-
ment collection and Q the set of queries represent-
ing users? information needs. Let alo ti symbol-
70
ize term i used to index the documents in the col-
lection, with i = 1, .., n. The VSM assumes that
for each term ti there exists a vector ~ti in the vector
space that represents it. It then considers the set of
all term vectors {~ti} to be the generating set of the
vector space, thus the space basis. If each dk,(for
k = 1, .., p) denotes a document of the collection,
then there exists a linear combination of the term
vectors {~ti} which represents each dk in the vector
space. Similarly, any query q can be modelled as
a vector ~q that is a linear combination of the term
vectors.
In the standard VSM, the term vectors are con-
sidered pairwise orthogonal, meaning that they are
linearly independent. But this assumption is un-
realistic, since it enforces lack of relatedness be-
tween any pair of terms, whereas the terms in a
language often relate to each other. Provided that
the orthogonality assumption holds, the similarity
between a document vector ~dk and a query vec-
tor ~q in the VSM can be expressed by the cosine
measure given in equation 1.
cos( ~dk, ~q) =
?n
j=1 akjqj
?
?n
i=1 a2ki
?n
j=1 q2j
(1)
where akj , qj are real numbers standing for the
weights of term j in the document dk and the
query q respectively. A standard baseline retrieval
strategy is to rank the documents according to their
cosine similarity to the query.
2.2 Generalized Vector Space Model
Wong et al (1987) presented an analysis of the
problems that the pairwise orthogonality assump-
tion of the VSM creates. They were the first to
address these problems by expanding the VSM.
They introduced term to term correlations, which
deprecated the pairwise orthogonality assumption,
but they kept the assumption that the term vectors
are linearly independent1, creating the first GVSM
model. More specifically, they considered a new
space, where each term vector ~ti was expressed as
a linear combination of 2n vectors ~mr, r = 1..2n.
The similarity measure between a document and a
query then became as shown in equation 2, where
~ti and ~tj are now term vectors in a 2n dimensional
vector space, ~dk, ~q are the document and the query
1It is known from Linear Algebra that if every pair of vec-
tors in a set of vectors is orthogonal, then this set of vectors
is linearly independent, but not the inverse.
vectors, respectively, as before, a?ki, q?j are the new
weights, and n? the new space dimensions.
cos( ~dk, ~q) =
?n?
j=1
?n?
i=1 a?kiq?j~ti~tj
?
?n?
i=1 a?ki2
?n?
j=1 q?j2
(2)
From equation 2 it follows that the term vectors
~ti and ~tj need not be known, as long as the cor-
relations between terms ti and tj are known. If
one assumes pairwise orthogonality, the similarity
measure is reduced to that of equation 1.
2.3 Semantic Information and GVSM
Since the introduction of the first GVSM model,
there are at least two basic directions for em-
bedding term to term relatedness, other than ex-
act keyword matching, into a retrieval model:
(a) compute semantic correlations between terms,
or (b) compute frequency co-occurrence statistics
from large corpora. In this paper we focus on the
first direction. In the past, the effect of WSD infor-
mation in text retrieval was studied (Krovetz and
Croft, 1992; Sanderson, 1994), with the results re-
vealing that under circumstances, senses informa-
tion may improve IR. More specifically, Krovetz
and Croft (1992) performed a series of three exper-
iments in two document collections, CACM and
TIMES. The results of their experiments showed
that word senses provide a clear distinction be-
tween relevant and nonrelevant documents, reject-
ing the null hypothesis that the meaning of a word
is not related to judgments of relevance. Also, they
reached the conclusion that words being worth
of disambiguation are either the words with uni-
form distribution of senses, or the words that in
the query have a different sense from the most
popular one. Sanderson (1994) studied the in-
fluence of disambiguation in IR with the use of
pseudowords and he concluded that sense ambi-
guity is problematic for IR only in the cases of
retrieving from short queries. Furthermore, his
findings regarding the WSD used were that such
a WSD system would help IR if it could perform
with very high accuracy, although his experiments
were conducted in the Reuters collection, where
standard queries with corresponding relevant doc-
uments (qrels) are not provided.
Since then, several recent approaches have
incorporated semantic information in VSM.
Mavroeidis et al (2005) created a GVSM ker-
nel based on the use of noun senses, and their
hypernyms from WordNet. They experimentally
71
showed that this can improve text categorization.
Stokoe et al (Stokoe et al, 2003) reported an im-
provement in retrieval performance using a fully
sense-based system. Our approach differs from
the aforementioned ones in that it expands the
VSM model using the semantic information of a
word thesaurus to interpret the orthogonality of
terms and to measure semantic relatedness, in-
stead of directly replacing terms with senses, or
adding senses to the model.
3 A GVSM Model based on Semantic
Relatedness of Terms
Synonymy (many words per sense) and polysemy
(many senses per word) are two fundamental prob-
lems in text retrieval. Synonymy is related with
recall, while polysemy with precision. One stan-
dard method to tackle synonymy is the expansion
of the query terms with their synonyms. This in-
creases recall, but it can reduce precision dramat-
ically. Both polysemy and synonymy can be cap-
tured on the GVSM model in the computation of
the inner product between ~ti and ~tj in equation 2,
as will be explained below.
3.1 Semantic Relatedness
In our model, we measure semantic relatedness us-
ing WordNet. It considers the path length, cap-
tured by compactness (SCM), and the path depth,
captured by semantic path elaboration (SPE),
which are defined in the following. The two mea-
sures are combined to for semantic relatedness
(SR) beetween two terms. SR, presented in defini-
tion 3, is the basic module of the proposed GVSM
model. The adopted method of building seman-
tic networks and measuring semantic relatedness
from a word thesaurus is explained in the next sub-
section.
Definition 1 Given a word thesaurus O, a weight-
ing scheme for the edges that assigns a weight e ?
(0, 1) for each edge, a pair of senses S = (s1, s2),
and a path of length l connecting the two senses,
the semantic compactness of S (SCM(S, O)) is
defined as ?li=1 ei, where e1, e2, ..., el are the
path?s edges. If s1 = s2 SCM(S, O) = 1. If there
is no path between s1 and s2 SCM(S, O) = 0.
Note that compactness considers the path length
and has values in the set [0, 1]. Higher com-
pactness between senses declares higher seman-
tic relatedness and larger weight are assigned to
stronger edge types. The intuition behind the as-
sumption of edges? weighting is the fact that some
edges provide stronger semantic connections than
others. In the next subsection we propose a can-
didate method of computing weights. The com-
pactness of two senses s1 and s2, can take differ-
ent values for all the different paths that connect
the two senses. All these paths are examined, as
explained later, and the path with the maximum
weight is eventually selected (definition 3). An-
other parameter that affects term relatedness is the
depth of the sense nodes comprising the path. A
standard means of measuring depth in a word the-
saurus is the hypernym/hyponym hierarchical re-
lation for the noun and adjective POS and hyper-
nym/troponym for the verb POS. A path with shal-
low sense nodes is more general compared to a
path with deep nodes. This parameter of seman-
tic relatedness between terms is captured by the
measure of semantic path elaboration introduced
in the following definition.
Definition 2 Given a word thesaurus O and a
pair of senses S = (s1, s2), where s1,s2 ? O
and s1 6= s2, and a path between the two senses
of length l, the semantic path elaboration of the
path (SPE(S,O)) is defined as ?li=1 2didi+1di+di+1 ? 1dmax ,
where di is the depth of sense si according to O,
and dmax the maximum depth of O. If s1 = s2,
and d = d1 = d2, SPE(S, O) = ddmax . If there is
no path from s1 to s2, SPE(S, O) = 0.
Essentially, SPE is the harmonic mean of the
two depths normalized to the maximum thesaurus
depth. The harmonic mean offers a lower upper
bound than the average of depths and we think
is a more realistic estimation of the path?s depth.
SCM and SPE capture the two most important
parameters of measuring semantic relatedness be-
tween terms (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006), namely
path length and senses depth in the used thesaurus.
We combine these two measures naturally towards
defining the Semantic Relatedness between two
terms.
Definition 3 Given a word thesaurus O, a pair of
terms T = (t1, t2), and all pairs of senses S =
(s1i, s2j), where s1i, s2j senses of t1,t2 respec-
tively. The semantic relatedness of T (SR(T,S,O))
is defined as max{SCM(S, O)?SPE(S, O)}. SR
between two terms ti, tj where ti ? tj ? t and
t /? O is defined as 1. If ti ? O but tj /? O, or
ti /? O but tj ? O, SR is defined as 0.

3.2 Semantic Networks from Word Thesauri
In order to construct a semantic network for a pair
of terms t1 and t2 and a combination of their re-
spective senses, i.e., s1 and s2, we adopted the
network construction method that we introduced
in (Tsatsaronis et al, 2007). This method was pre-
ferred against other related methods, like the one
introduced in (Mihalcea et al, 2004), since it em-
beds all the available semantic information exist-
ing in WordNet, even edges that cross POS, thus
offering a richer semantic representation. Accord-
ing to the adopted semantic network construction
model, each semantic edge type is given a different
weight. The intuition behind edge types? weight-
ing is that certain types provide stronger semantic
connections than others. The frequency of occur-
rence of the different edge types in Wordnet 2.0, is
used to define the edge types? weights (e.g. 0.57
for hypernym/hyponym edges, 0.14 for nominal-
ization edges etc.).
Figure 1 shows the construction of a semantic
network for two terms ti and tj . Let the high-
lighted senses S.i.2 and S.j.1 be a pair of senses
of ti and tj respectively. All the semantic links
of the highlighted senses, as found in WordNet,
are added as shown in example 1 of figure 1. The
process is repeated recursively until at least one
path between S.i.2 and S.j.1 is found. It might be
the case that there is no path from S.i.2 to S.j.1.
In that case SR((ti, tj), (S.i.2, S.j.1), O) = 0.
Suppose that a path is that of example 2, where
e1, e2, e3 are the respective edge weights, d1 is the
depth of S.i.2, d2 the depth of S.i.2.1, d3 the depth
of S.i.2.2 and d4 the depth of S.j.1, and dmax the
maximum thesaurus depth. For reasons of sim-
plicity, let e1 = e2 = e3 = 0.5, and d1 = 3.
Naturally, d2 = 4, and let d3 = d4 = d2 = 4. Fi-
nally, let dmax = 14, which is the case for Word-
Net 2.0. Then, SR((ti, tj), (S.i.2, S.j.1), O) =
0.53 ? 0.4615 ? 0.52 = 0.01442. Example 3 of
figure 2 illustrates another possibility where S.i.7
and S.j.5 is another examined pair of senses for ti
and tj respectively. In this case, the two senses co-
incide, and SR((ti, tj), (S.i.7, S.j.5), O) = 1 ? d14 ,
where d the depth of the sense. When two senses
coincide, SCM = 1, as mentioned in definition 1,
a secondary criterion must be levied to distinguish
the relatedness of senses that match. This crite-
rion in SR is SPE, which assumes that a sense
is more specific as we traverse WordNet graph
downwards. In the specified example, SCM = 1,
but SPE = d14 . This will give a final value to SR
that will be less than 1. This constitutes an intrin-
sic property of SR, which is expressed by SPE.
The rationale behind the computation of SPE
stems from the fact that word senses in WordNet
are organized into synonym sets, named synsets.
Moreover, synsets belong to hierarchies (i.e., noun
hierarchies developed by the hypernym/hyponym
relations). Thus, in case two words map into the
same synset (i.e., their senses belong to the same
synset), the computation of their semantic related-
ness must additionally take into account the depth
of that synset in WordNet.
3.3 Computing Maximum Semantic
Relatedness
In the expansion of the VSM model we need to
weigh the inner product between any two term
vectors with their semantic relatedness. It is obvi-
ous that given a word thesaurus, there can be more
than one semantic paths that link two senses. In
these cases, we decide to use the path that max-
imizes the semantic relatedness (the product of
SCM and SPE). This computation can be done
according to the following algorithm, which is a
modification of Dijkstra?s algorithm for finding
the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted
directed graph. The proof of the algorithm?s cor-
rectness follows with theorem 1.
Theorem 1 Given a word thesaurus O, a weight-
ing function w : E ? (0, 1), where a higher value
declares a stronger edge, and a pair of senses
S(ss, sf ) declaring source (ss) and destination
(sf ) vertices, then the SCM(S, O) ? SPE(S, O)
is maximized for the path returned by Algorithm
1, by using the weighting scheme eij = wij ?
2?di?dj
dmax?(di+dj) , where eij the new weight of the edge
connecting senses si and sj , and wij the initial

18: end for
19: end while
20: return the path following all the ancestors ? of

weight assigned by weighting function w.
Proof 1 For the proof of this theorem we follow
the course of thinking of the proof of theorem
25.10 in (Cormen et al, 1990). We shall show
that for each vertex sf ? V , d[sf ] is the max-
imum product of edges? weight through the se-
lected path, starting from ss, at the time when
sf is inserted into S. From now on, the nota-
tion ?(ss, sf ) will represent this product. Path
p connects a vertex in S, namely ss, to a ver-
tex in V ? S, namely sf . Consider the first ver-
tex sy along p such that sy ? V ? S and let sx
be y?s predecessor. Now, path p can be decom-
posed as ss ? sx ? sy ? sf . We claim that
d[sy] = ?(ss, sy) when sf is inserted into S. Ob-
serve that sx ? S. Then, because sf is chosen as
the first vertex for which d[sf ] 6= ?(ss, sf ) when it
is inserted into S, we had d[sx] = ?(ss, sx) when
sx was inserted into S.
We can now obtain a contradiction to the
above to prove the theorem. Because sy oc-
curs before sf on the path from ss to sf and all
edge weights are nonnegative2 and in (0, 1) we
have ?(ss, sy) ? ?(ss, sf ), and thus d[sy] =
?(ss, sy) ? ?(ss, sf ) ? d[sf ]. But both sy
and sf were in V ? S when sf was chosen,
so we have d[sf ] ? d[sy]. Thus, d[sy] =
?(ss, sy) = ?(ss, sf ) = d[sf ]. Consequently,
d[sf ] = ?(ss, sf ) which contradicts our choice of
sf . We conclude that at the time each vertex sf is
inserted into S, d[sf ] = ?(ss, sf ).
Next, to prove that the returned maximum
product is the SCM(S, O) ? SPE(S, O), let
the path between ss and sf with the maximum
edge weight product have k edges. Then, Al-
gorithm 1 returns the maximum

3.4 Word Sense Disambiguation
The reader will have noticed that our model com-
putes the SR between two terms ti,tj , based on the
pair of senses si,sj of the two terms respectively,
which maximizes the product SCM ? SPE. Al-
ternatively, a WSD algorithm could have disam-
biguated the two terms, given the text fragments
where the two terms occurred. Though interesting,
this prospect is neither addressed, nor examined in
this work. Still, it is in our next plans and part of
our future work to embed in our model some of
the interesting WSD approaches, like knowledge-
based (Sinha and Mihalcea, 2007; Brody et al,
2006), corpus-based (Mihalcea and Csomai, 2005;
McCarthy et al, 2004), or combinations with very
high accuracy (Montoyo et al, 2005).
3.5 The GVSM Model
In equation 2, which captures the document-query
similarity in the GVSM model, the orthogonality
between terms ti and tj is expressed by the inner
product of the respective term vectors ~ti~tj . Recall
that ~ti and ~tj are in reality unknown. We estimate
their inner product by equation 3, where si and
sj are the senses of terms ti and tj respectively,
maximizing SCM ? SPE.
~ti~tj = SR((ti, tj), (si, sj), O) (3)
Since in our model we assume that each term can
be semantically related with any other term, and
2The sign of the algorithm is not considered at this step.
74
SR((ti, tj), O) = SR((tj , ti), O), the new space
is of n?(n?1)2 dimensions. In this space, each di-
mension stands for a distinct pair of terms. Given
a document vector ~dk in the VSM TF-IDF space,
we define the value in the (i, j) dimension of
the new document vector space as dk(ti, tj) =
(TF ? IDF (ti, dk) + TF ? IDF (tj , dk)) ? ~ti~tj .
We add the TF-IDF values because any product-
based value results to zero, unless both terms are
present in the document. The dimensions q(ti, tj)
of the query, are computed similarly. A GVSM
model aims at being able to retrieve documents
that not necessarily contain exact matches of the
query terms, and this is its great advantage. This
new space leads to a new GVSM model, which is
a natural extension of the standard VSM. The co-
sine similarity between a document dk and a query
q now becomes:
cos( ~dk, ~q) =
? n
i=1
? n
j=i dk(ti, tj) ? q(ti, tj)
?
? n
i=1
? n
j=i dk(ti, tj)2 ?
?
? n
i=1
? n
j=i q(ti, tj)2
(4)
where n is the dimension of the VSM TF-IDF
space.
4 Experimental Evaluation
The experimental evaluation in this work is two-
fold. First, we test the performance of the seman-
tic relatedness measure (SR) for a pair of words
in three benchmark data sets, namely the Ruben-
stein and Goodenough 65 word pairs (Ruben-
stein and Goodenough, 1965)(R&G), the Miller
and Charles 30 word pairs (Miller and Charles,
1991)(M&C), and the 353 similarity data set
(Finkelstein et al, 2002). Second, we evaluate
the performance of the proposed GVSM in three
TREC collections (TREC 1, 4 and 6).
4.1 Evaluation of the Semantic Relatedness
Measure
For the evaluation of the proposed semantic re-
latedness measure between two terms we experi-
mented in three widely used data sets in which hu-
man subjects have provided scores of relatedness
for each pair. A kind of ?gold standard? ranking
of related word pairs (i.e., from the most related
words to the most irrelevant) has thus been cre-
ated, against which computer programs can test
their ability on measuring semantic relatedness be-
tween words. We compared our measure against
ten known measures of semantic relatedness: (HS)
Hirst and St-Onge (1998), (JC) Jiang and Conrath
(1997), (LC) Leacock et al (1998), (L) Lin (1998),
(R) Resnik (1995), (JS) Jarmasz and Szpakowicz
(2003), (GM) Gabrilovich and Markovitch (2007),
(F) Finkelstein et al (2002), (HR) ) and (SP)
Strube and Ponzetto (2006). In Table 1 the results
of SR and the ten compared measures are shown.
The reported numbers are the Spearman correla-
tion of the measures? rankings with the gold stan-
dard (human judgements).
The correlations for the three data sets show that
SR performs better than any other measure of se-
mantic relatedness, besides the case of (HR) in the
M&C data set. It surpasses HR though in the R&G
and the 353-C data set. The latter contains the
word pairs of the M&C data set. To visualize the
performance of our measure in a more comprehen-
sible manner, Figure 2 presents for all pairs in the
R&G data set, and with increasing order of relat-
edness values based on human judgements, the re-
spective values of these pairs that SR produces. A
closer look on Figure 2 reveals that the values pro-
duced by SR (right figure) follow a pattern similar
to that of the human ratings (left figure). Note that
the x-axis in both charts begins from the least re-
lated pair of terms, according to humans, and goes
up to the most related pair of terms. The y-axis
in the left chart is the respective humans? rating
for each pair of terms. The right figure shows SR
for each pair. The reader can consult Budanitsky
and Hirst (2006) to confirm that all the other mea-
sures of semantic relatedness we compare to, do
not follow the same pattern as the human ratings,
as closely as our measure of relatedness does (low
y values for small x values and high y values for
high x). The same pattern applies in the M&C and
353-C data sets.
4.2 Evaluation of the GVSM
For the evaluation of the proposed GVSM model,
we have experimented with three TREC collec-
tions 3, namely TREC 1 (TIPSTER disks 1 and
2), TREC 4 (TIPSTER disks 2 and 3) and TREC
6 (TIPSTER disks 4 and 5). We selected those
TREC collections in order to cover as many dif-
ferent thematic subjects as possible. For example,
TREC 1 contains documents from the Wall Street
Journal, Associated Press, Federal Register, and
abstracts of U.S. department of energy. TREC 6
differs from TREC 1, since it has documents from
Financial Times, Los Angeles Times and the For-
eign Broadcast Information Service.
For each TREC, we executed the standard base-

line TF-IDF VSM model for the first 20 topics
of each collection. Limited resources prohibited
us from executing experiments in the top 1000
documents. To minimize the execution time, we
have indexed all the pairwise semantic related-
ness values according to the SR measure, in a
database, whose size reached 300GB. Thus, the
execution of the SR itself is really fast, as all pair-
wise SR values between WordNet synsets are in-
dexed. For TREC 1, we used topics 51 ? 70, for
TREC 4 topics 201 ? 220 and for TREC 6 topics
301 ? 320. From the results of the VSM model,
we kept the top-50 retrieved documents. In order
to evaluate whether the proposed GVSM can aid
the VSM performance, we executed the GVSM
in the same retrieved documents. The interpo-
lated precision-recall values in the 11-standard re-
call points for these executions are shown in fig-
ure 3 (left graphs), for both VSM and GVSM. In
the right graphs of figure 3, the differences in in-
terpolated precision for the same recall levels are
depicted. For reasons of simplicity, we have ex-
cluded the recall values in the right graphs, above
which, both systems had zero precision. Thus, for
TREC 1 in the y-axis we have depicted the differ-
ence in the interpolated precision values (%) of the
GVSM from the VSM, for the first 4 recall points.
For TRECs 4 and 6 we have done the same for the
first 9 and 8 recall points respectively.
As shown in figure 3, the proposed GVSM may
improve the performance of the TFIDF VSM up to
1.93% in TREC 4, 0.99% in TREC 6 and 0.42%
in TREC 1. This small boost in performance
proves that the proposed GVSM model is promis-
ing. There are many aspects though in the GVSM
that we think require further investigation, like for
example the fact that we have not conducted WSD
so as to map each document and query term oc-
currence into its correct sense, or the fact that the
weighting scheme of the edges used in SR gen-
erates from the distribution of each edge type in
WordNet, while there might be other more sophis-
ticated ways to compute edge weights. We believe
that if these, but also more aspects discussed in
the next section, are tackled, the proposed GVSM
may improve more the retrieval performance.
5 Future Work
From the experimental evaluation we infer that
SR performs very well, and in fact better than all
the tested related measures. With regards to the
GVSM model, experimental evaluation in three
TREC collections has shown that the model is
promising and may boost retrieval performance
more if several details are further investigated and
further enhancements are made. Primarily, the
computation of the maximum semantic related-
ness between two terms includes the selection of
the semantic path between two senses that maxi-
mizes SR. This can be partially unrealistic since
we are not sure whether these senses are the cor-
rect senses of the terms. To tackle this issue,
WSD techniques may be used. In addition, the
role of phrase detection is yet to be explored and

added into the model. Since we are using a large
knowledge-base (WordNet), we can add a simple
method to look-up term occurrences in a specified
window and check whether they form a phrase.
This would also decrease the ambiguity of the re-
spective text fragment, since in WordNet a phrase
is usually monosemous.
Moreover, there are additional aspects that de-
serve further research. In previously proposed
GVSM, like the one proposed by Voorhees (1993),
or by Mavroeidis et al (2005), it is suggested
that semantic information can create an individual
space, leading to a dual representation of each doc-
ument, namely, a vector with document?s terms
and another with semantic information. Ratio-
nally, the proposed GVSM could act complemen-
tary to the standard VSM representation. Thus, the
similarity between a query and a document may be
computed by weighting the similarity in the terms
space and the senses? space. Finally, we should
also examine the perspective of applying the pro-
posed measure of semantic relatedness in a query
expansion technique, similarly to the work of Fang
(2008).
6 Conclusions
In this paper we presented a new measure of
semantic relatedness and expanded the standard
VSM to embed the semantic relatedness between
pairs of terms into a new GVSM model. The
semantic relatedness measure takes into account
all of the semantic links offered by WordNet. It
considers WordNet as a graph, weighs edges de-
pending on their type and depth and computes
the maximum relatedness between any two nodes,
connected via one or more paths. The com-
parison to well known measures gives promis-
ing results. The application of our measure in
the suggested GVSM demonstrates slightly im-
proved performance in information retrieval tasks.
It is on our next plans to study the influence of
WSD performance on the proposed model. Fur-
thermore, a comparative analysis between the pro-
posed GVSM and other semantic network based
models will also shed light towards the condi-
tions, under which, embedding semantic informa-
tion improves text retrieval.
