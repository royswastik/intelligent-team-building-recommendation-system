Abstract 
This paper describes a model that has been de-
veloped in the Turgama Project at Leiden Uni-
versity to meet the challenges encountered in 
the computational analysis of ancient Syriac 
Biblical manuscripts. The small size of the 
corpus, the absence of native speakers, and the 
variation attested in the multitude of textual 
witnesses require a model of encoding?rather 
than tagging?that moves from the formal dis-
tributional registration of linguistic elements 
to functional deductions. The model is illumi-
nated by an example from verb inflection. It 
shows how a corpus-based analysis can im-
prove upon the inflectional paradigms given in 
traditional grammars and how the various or-
thographic representations can be accounted 
for by an encoding system that registers both 
the paradigmatic forms and their attested reali-
zations. 
1 Working with ancient documents 
1.1 Challenges 
If we wish to make a linguistic analysis of an-
cient texts, in our case the Hebrew Bible and its 
Syriac translation, the Peshitta (ca. 2nd century 
CE), we are confronted with a number of chal-
lenges:  
? There is no native speaker of the lan-
guages involved. We do not know in ad-
vance what categories are relevant in the 
linguistic analysis, what functions a cer-
tain construction has, or what functional 
oppositions there exist in the language 
system. For this reason we should avoid as 
much as we can any model that presup-
poses knowledge about the language. 
? We have only written sources. Hence we 
are challenged by the complex interaction 
between orthographic conventions and 
morphological phenomena. There are even 
some orthographic practices which, it is 
claimed, have never been supported by a 
phonological or morphological realization 
(see section 4.5). 
? We are dealing with multiple unique 
documents. In philology, the text of the 
Hebrew Bible or its Syriac translation is 
an abstract notion, a scholarly construct. 
The corpus that we enter into our database 
consists of the concrete witnesses to the 
abstract text. Textual variants provide use-
ful information about language variation 
and development (section 4.5). 
? We are dealing with a small corpus. The 
Hebrew Bible contains about 300.000?
400.000 words (depending on whether we 
count graphic words or functional words); 
the vocabulary consists of about 8.000 lex-
emes. 
Moreover, because of the context in which our 
research takes place, at the boundary of linguis-
tics and philology, our aim is the construction of 
a database with a correctly encoded text. Because 
we want to understand the text, rather than 
merely collect knowledge about the language 
system, we have set high standards of accuracy 
for the encoding of the text. 
1.2 Dilemmas 
These challenges lead to the following dilemmas 
for the computational analysis of ancient texts: 
? Data-oriented or theory-driven? Since 
approaches that presuppose linguistic 
knowledge are problematic, we want to be 
1
data-oriented, rather than theory-driven. 
However, approaches that merely try to 
extract knowledge from the corpus with a 
minimum of human input are insufficient 
because of the size of our corpus and be-
cause we want knowledge about the text, 
not just about the language. 
? Priority for the corpus or the language? 
Due to the lack of native speakers, the sole 
basis for our knowledge about the lan-
guage is the corpus, but, at the same time, 
the corpus can only be accessed through 
some linguistic knowledge and some basic 
understanding of the text. We cannot start 
from scratch, avoiding any preliminary 
understanding of the text, its language, its 
features, and its meaning. This under-
standing is shaped by our scholarly and 
cultural tradition. It is based on transmit-
ted knowledge. But we have to find ways 
in which the computational analysis does 
not only imitate or repeat traditional inter-
pretations. 
1.3 Requirements 
The challenges and dilemmas mentioned above 
require a model that is deductive rather than in-
ductive; that goes from form (the concrete tex-
tual data) to function (the categories that we do 
not know a priori); that entails registering the 
distribution of linguistic elements, rather than 
merely adding functional labels?in other words, 
that involves encoding rather than tagging; that 
registers both the paradigmatic forms and their 
realizations; that allows grammatical categories 
and formal descriptions to be redefined on the 
basis of corpus analysis; and that involves inter-
active analytical procedures, which are needed 
for the level of accuracy we aim for. 
In the distributional analysis at word level, for 
example, we mark prefixes and suffixes, rather 
than tagging a form as ?imperfect 2ms? etc. 
Similarly on clause level we identify patterns 
such as ?subject + participle + complement?, as 
against the usual practice of giving functional 
clause labels such as ?circumstantial clause?. 
2 Analytical procedure 
In our project the analysis of Hebrew and Syriac 
involves a bottom-up linguistic analysis at the 
following levels: 
2.1 Word level 
This level concerns the segmentation of words 
into morphemes, the functional deductions from 
the morphological analysis, and the assignment 
of lexically determined word functions. It will be 
described in detail in section 3. 
2.2 Phrase level 
At this level words are combined into phrases 
(e.g. noun + adjective). This entails the morpho-
syntactic analysis and the systematic adaptations 
of word classes in certain environments (e.g. ad-
jective ? noun), and the analysis of phrase-
internal relations (e.g. apposition). 
2.3 Clause level 
This level concerns the combination of phrases 
into clauses (e.g. conjunction + VP + determinate 
NP), and the assignment of syntactic functions 
(e.g. subject, predicate). 
2.4 Text level 
This level concerns the determination of the rela-
tionships between clauses and the assignment of 
the syntactical functions of the clauses within the 
text hierarchy (e.g. object clause). 
3 Workflow of word-level analysis 
In the following discussion we will restrict our-
selves to the morphological analysis. At the 
higher linguistic levels the same principles are 
applied, although the consequences are some-
what different (see section 5). 
3.1 Running text 
As an example we take the Syriac translation 
(Peshitta) of the book of Judges. The starting-
point of the analysis is a transliterated running 
text, called P_Judges, which reflects the Leiden 
Peshitta edition. Sample 1 contains the first verse 
of this text. The variant notation between square 
brackets indicates that the first word, whw', ?and 
it happened?, is missing in a number of manu-
scripts. Between the angle brackets a comment 
has been added. 
Even this first step involves a number of dis-
ambiguating decisions, for example, as to 
whether a dot above a letter is a vowel sign, a 
delimitation marker, or just a spot in the manu-
script.1 
                                                 
1 One has to take similar decisions if one transcribes 
the text of a manuscript to Unicode, because the defi-
nitions of the Unicode characters include both a for-

Sample 1: P_Judges (running text) 
3.2 Production of graphic text (?pil2wit?) 
The program pil2wit transforms the running text 
into the so-called graphic text, a transliterated 
text according to an established format that en-
ables the subsequent steps in the analysis (sam-
ple 2). It has another transliteration system;2 in-
structions to select variants have been executed; 
comments have been omitted; and the markers of 
book, chapter and verse have been added.

3.3 Production of encoded text (?Analyse?) 
The grapic text is the input file for the program 
Analyse, which concerns the segmentation of the 
Syriac words into morphemes (as far as concate-
native morphemes are involved3). For this seg-
mentation we use a system of encoding, rather 
than tagging. Thus the imperfect form neqtol ?he 
will kill? is encoded as !N!QV&WL[, in which 
the exclamation marks !?! indicate the prefix, 
the ampersand & a paradigmatically unexpected 
letter?the round bracket ( indicates an expected 
but absent letter?and the square bracket to the 
right [ a verbal ending. Sample 3 provides the 
interface in the interactive procedure of Analyse.

mal description and a functional analysis. There is not 
a character for ?a dot above the letter?, but rather for 
?vowel sign above the letter? etc.

3 Non-concatenative morphemes are marked with a 
colon at the end of a word. We use :p for the vowel 
pattern of the passive; :d for the doubled verbal stem 
and :c for the construct state vocalization of nouns. 
Sample 3: P_Judices.an (analysed text; automatically 
generated file) 
The first column contains the verse number, the 
second the graphic words (which may contain 
more than one functional word; thus the first 
graphic word contains the conjunction W and the 
verb HW>) and the third column contains propos-
als for the morphological segmentation. These 
proposals are generated from the ?Analytical 
Lexicon?, a data file containing the results of pre-
vious analyses (sample 4).

Sample 4: Excerpt from the Analytical Lexicon 
 
It appears, for example, that up to the moment 
that sample 4 was extracted from the lexicon, the 
form WCLX had received two different encodings 
(lines 9310 and 9311; see below, section 4.3). 
The human researcher has to accept or reject 
the proposals made by Analyse or to add a new 
analysis. We cannot go through all details, but in 
the second line of sample 4, for example, a 
choice has to be made between the preposition 
men (MN) and the interrogative pronoun man 
(MN=; the disambiguating function of the equals 
sign is recorded in the lexicon [section 3.6], 
where both MN and MN= are defined). Likewise, 
in the case of <BDH, the human researcher has to 
decide whether this is a verb (hence the verbal 
ending [), the noun ?servant? (<BD=), or the 
noun ?work? (<BD==). 
For these disambiguating decisions in the in-
teractive procedure the human researcher follows 
a protocol that describes the relative weight of 
diacritical dots in the oldest manuscripts, the 
vowel signs that are added in some manuscripts, 
the vocalization in printed editions, and gram-
matical and contextual considerations.

Sample 5: P_Judices.an (analysed text; outcome of 
interactive procedure) 
 
After the interactive procedure the analysed text 
contains the ?correct? analysis for each word of 
3
the graphic text (sample 5). As we shall see be-
low, we do not consider this as the definitive 
analysis, but rather as a hypothesis about the data 
that can be tested in the following steps of the 
analytical procedure. 
3.4 Reformatting and selection (?Genat?) 
The next step concerns the selection of a chapter 
and the reformatting of the document. This is 
done automatically by the program Genat. The 
result is e.g. P_Judices01.at (sample 6).

Sample 6: P_Judices01.at (analysed text, reformatted) 
3.5 Functional deductions (?at2ps?) 
The next step concerns the functional deductions 
from the morphological analysis (e.g. person, 
number, gender) and the assignment of lexically 
determined word functions (e.g. part of speech). 
For this purpose the program at2ps uses three 
language definition files: a description of the al-
phabet, a lexicon (section 3.6), and a description 
of the morphology (?Word Grammar?; section 
3.7). 
3.6 The Lexicon 
Each line in the Lexicon contains the lexeme, a 
unique identification number, lexically relevant 
characteristics such as a part of speech (sp) or a 
lexical set (ls), a gloss (gl), which is only in-
tended for the human user and, optionally, a 
comment added after the hash (#).

3.7 The ?Word Grammar? 
The encoded text is read by the Word Grammar. 
In this auxiliary file are registered (1) the types 
of morphemes recognized; (2) the individual 
morphemes of each morpheme type; (3) a list of 
grammatical functions; and (4) rules for the func-
tional deductions (see samples 8?11).

  vbe != {"", "WN", "N="} :: reject 
 end

  vbe == {""} :: gn=f, nu=sg 
   vbe != "" :: reject 
 end 
Sample 11: Extract from the Word Grammar, section 
4: Rules for functional deductions 
 
Each rule concerns the pairing of a morphologi-
cal condition and an action. The condition is 
phrased as a Boolean expression yielding true or 
false indicating whether the condition is met or 
not. If the condition is met, the listed actions are 
undertaken. An action is usually the assignment 
of a value to a word function, but can also in-
volve accepting or rejecting a form, or jumping 
to a rule further down. Thus the rule 
4
vbe == "W"   :: gn=m, nu=pl 
can be read as: if there is a verbal ending W, then 
assign the values gender = masculine and num-
ber = plural. 
3.8 Result: the ps2 file 
The result is a ps2 file. Each row contains a verse 
reference, the lexeme, and a list of lexical and 
morphological features such as the lexical set, 
part of speech, verbal prefix, verbal stem, verbal 
ending, nominal ending, verbal tense, person, 
number, gender, nominal state. Thus the second 
line of sample 12 shows that the second word of 
Judges is HWJ, ?to be?, which has the lexical set 
?verb of existence? (-2); it has the part of speech 
?verb? (1); it has no verbal prefix (0); it comes 
from the simple verbal stem Peal or Qal (0); it 
has an empty verbal ending (1); it has no nomi-
nal ending (0); it is a perfect form (2) 3rd person 
(3) singular (1), without personal suffix (-1),4 
masculine (2); and the notion of ?state? does not 
apply to it (-1), because this notion is only used 
in the case of nominal endings.

appears from its own grammatical functions, which 
are different from those of the word to which it is at-
tached. The traditional lexicographical practice, how-
ever, does not treat it as a lexeme (Sikkel, 2008).

The workflow can be summarized as follows: 
 
Input & output Programs Auxiliary

Table 1: workflow of word level analysis 
 
It follows that the following programs and data 
sets are used: 
? Programs that recognize the patterns of 
formal elements that combine to form 
words, phrases, clauses and textual units 
(e.g. at2ps). 
? Language-specific auxiliary files (e.g. 
Lexicon, Word Grammar). 
? Data sets, built up gradually, containing 
all patterns registered in the analysis (e.g. 
Analytical Lexicon) 
? Programs that use the data sets and the 
auxiliary files to make proposals in the in-
teractive procedures for the linguistic 
analysis (e.g. Analyse).

3.10 Relation with requirements 
Some typical features of the workflow serve to 
meet the requirements defined in section 1.3. The 
procedure of encoding rather than tagging guar-
antees consistency in the analysis of morphemes, 
because the functional deductions are produced 
automatically. It has the advantage that not only 
the interpretation of a word, but also the data 
which led to a certain interpretation can be re-
trieved, whereas the motivation behind a tagging 
is usually not visible. It also has the advantage 
that both the surface forms and the functional 
analysis are preserved. 
By using the language-specific auxiliary files 
we take our starting-point in the scholarly tradi-
tion of Semitic studies, but the encoding system 
allows us to test alternative interpretations of the 
data (see below, section 4.5). 
4 The verbal paradigm 
4.1 Traditional grammars 
We will now illuminate our model by taking a 
look at the verbal paradigm. For the moment we 
will restrict ourselves to the paradigm of the suf-
fix conjugation. In the traditional grammars we 
find the following inflection paradigm: 
 
 singular plural 
3 m ? w [silent] 
? 
wn (un) 
3 f t (at) ? 
y [silent] 
2 m t (t) twn (ton) 
2 f ty (t) tyn (ten) 
1 c t (et) n (n) 
nn (nan) 
Table 2: Paradigm of the perfect in Classical Syriac 
according to traditional grammars 
4.2 Manuscript evidence 
Since we work with real manuscripts, we have to 
deal with the forms that are actually attested. As 
appears from the paradigm in table 2, for exam-
ple, the perfect 3mp sometimes has no verbal 
ending. What is not recorded in the traditional 
grammars is that there are also forms 3ms with 
the ending -w. This may be due to the fact that 
the -w in the plural, even if it were represented in 
writing, was not pronounced.5 Traditionally the 
                                                 
5 Admittedly, it can be problematic to make claims 
about the pronunciation on the basis of written 
sources, but there are strong arguments for this claim, 
singular forms with -w are taken as errors, due to 
the confusion with the silent -w in the plural. 
The Leiden Peshitta edition takes such read-
ings as ?orthographic variants?. They do not ap-
pear in the critical apparatus to the text, but in a 
separate Index Orthographicus. The general pref-
ace to the edition contains a long list of catego-
ries of orthographical variation (cf. sample 15). 
 
2.2 varietates inflectionis 
2.2.1 afformativa 
2.2.1.1 perfectum 
e.g. 3 msg + waw 
3 f.sg yodh 
2 m.sg + yodh 
2 f.sg om yodh 
3 m.pl om waw 
3 f.pl + waw 
3 f. pl + yodh 
1 pl cum des -nan etc., etc.

Sample 16: Excerpt from Index Orthographicus to 
Song of Songs in sample volume of Leiden Peshitta 
edition 
 
Unfortunately, the Peshitta project soon aban-
doned the inclusion of the Index Orthograhicus. 
It appears only in the sample edition and one 
other volume (Vol. IV/6, containing Odes, the 
Prayer of Manasseh, Apocryphal Psalms, Psalms 
of Solomon, Tobit and 1(3) Esdras). 
                                                                          
including the fact that the final letter is ignored in 
punctuation, that it is frequently omitted in writing 
(N?ldeke, 2001:?50), and that it does not affect poetic 
patterns (Brockelmann, 1960:45).

4.3 Encoding the attested forms 
In the word-level analysis (cf. section 2.1) the 
forms listed in table 2 are encoded as follows: 
 
 singular plural 
3m KTB[ KTB[W 
KTB[(W 
KTB[W&N 
3f KTB[T== KTB[(J= 
KTB[J= 
2m KTB[T= KTB[TWN 
2f KTB[TJ KTB[TJN 
1c KTB[T KTB[N 
KTB[N&N 
Table 3: Encoded forms of Classical Syriac perfect 
 
As we said above, the square bracket to the right 
marks the verbal ending and the ampersand a 
paradigmatically unexpected letter. Thus our en-
coding in table 3 implies that we take the verbal 
ending -wn as an allomorph of -w with an addi-
tional -n. Alternatively we could decide to intro-
duce a separate morpheme -wn besides -w. The 
equals sign is used for the disambiguation of 
forms that have the same consonantal representa-
tion. We use it to distinguish the three verbal 
endings -t and for distinguishing the -y of the 
perfect 3fs from the -y of the imperative 3fs. 
A round bracket marks a paradigmatically ex-
pected but absent letter. Thus we have taken the 
imperfect form 3fs KTBJ as the paradigmatic 
form, although KTB occurs as well. 
4.4 Paradigmatic forms and their realiza-
tions 
To deal with this material in an appropriate way 
it is important to use an encoding system in 
which both the attested surface forms and the 
abstract morphemes can be retrieved. Thus 
?wqdw ?they burnt (it)? (Judges 1:8; our tran-
scription: >WQDW) is a form of the verb yqd 
(JQD), with the causative prefix ?- (>). We mark 
the causative stem morpheme with two square 
brackets to the left (cf. sample 8), indicate with 
the round bracket to the right that the first letter 
of the lexeme is absent, and mark with the am-
persand the w that has come instead. The square 
bracket to the right marks the verbal ending. This 
results in the following encoding: 
Encoding:           ]>](J&WQD[W 
Paradigmatic forms:  >  JQD   W 
Realizations:        >  WQD   W 
4.5 Language variation and language de-
velopment 
This way of encoding the verb forms attested in 
multiple textual witnesses provides us with a 
large database from which language variation 
data can be retrieved. In some cases language 
development is involved as well, and the data 
can be used for diachronic analysis. For this re-
search we can build upon the work done by the 
Syriac scholar Sebastian Brock. One of the phe-
nomena Brock (2003:99?100) observed was that 
in West Syriac Biblical manuscripts some ortho-
graphic innovations are attested, including the 
addition of a -y to the perfect 3fp, the imperfect 
3fs and, on analogy, the perfect 3fs. It is a de-
bated issue whether this ending reflects a mor-
pheme that was once pronounced (thus Boyarin, 
1981) or just an orthographic convention (thus 
Brock, 2003; cf. Van Peursen, 2008:244). 
4.6 An experiment 
Our approach enables us to deploy a practice that 
is completely new in Syriac scholarship, namely 
the possibility of testing assumptions upon the 
data (cf. Talstra & Dyk, 2006). We can test, for 
example, what happens if we redefine the distri-
bution of ktb and ktbw (cf. section 4.2) and take 
the zero ending and the -w as allomorphs for the 
3rd person masculine. 
In our model such a reinterpretation of the ma-
terial can be registered formally by changing the 
relevant sections in the Word Grammar. Since 
the lemmatization is done automatically on the 
basis of the morphologically encoded text and a 
functional description of the morphemes, there is 
no need to change the lemmatization in all sepa-
rate instances manually. 
We have done this experiment for Judges 1 in 
nineteen manuscripts. This chapter contains 54 
perfect forms 3m (except for third-weak verbs). 
In the bottom-up analysis (cf. section 2) the ef-
fect is that the decision on whether a 3m verb is 
singular or plural is not taken at word level, but 
at a later stage of the procedure, in which the 
verb is matched with a subject or another ele-
ment that reveals its number. 
At first sight the results of our experiment 
were not exciting. In those 26 cases where the 
grammatical number of the subject is unambigu-
ous, the ?regular? forms are dominant: Only three 
times is there an irregular form (singular ktbw or 
plural ktb), once in one manuscript, twice in two 
7
manuscripts.6 Nevertheless, our experiment 
yielded some interesting observations. 
In the first place we discovered that in 28 
cases the grammatical number remained am-
biguous even in the clause-level analysis because 
the subject was a collective noun (which in 
Syriac can take either a singular or a plural). 
In these ambiguous cases the traditional analy-
sis of ktb as a singular and ktbw as a plural im-
plies a striking alternation of singular and plural 
forms, e.g. 1:10 ?and Judah went (w?zl, singular) 
? and [they] killed (wq?lw, plural)?. In our ex-
periment, this became mere orthographic varia-
tion. Consequently, in the final stage of the bot-
tom-up analytical procedure, the text hierarchical 
analysis (section 2.4), we arrived at a more ele-
gant text hierarchical structure, because many of 
the recurrent subject changes caused by the sin-
gular/plural alternation had been resolved. 
Secondly, the experiment overcame the rather 
arbitrary division between ?real? and ortho-
graphic variants in the Leiden Peshitta edition. In 
this edition, whenever there may be some doubt 
as to whether the verb is in the singular or in the 
plural, variation between ktb and ktbw forms is 
taken as ?real? and the variant is included in the 
critical apparatus; whenever there is no doubt, 
the variation is considered orthographic and the 
variant is listed in the Index Orthographicus 
(sample edition and vol. IV/6) or not mentioned 
at all (other volumes; cf. Dirksen, 1972:vii-ix). 
This editorial policy leads to the somewhat ar-
bitrary decision that n?t ?descended? in 1:9 (Ms 
16c1, 16g3; other manuscripts: n??w) is an or-
thographic variant, because the subject is the plu-
ral bny yhwd? ?sons of Judah, Judahites?, whereas 
in 1:10, where the subject is just yhwd? ?Judah?, 
?zlw ?went? (Ms 17a3; other manuscripts: ?zl) is a 
real variant. In 1:26, the same form ?zlw (Ms 
19c1; other manuscripts have again ?zl) is taken 
as orthographic, because the subject is the singu-
lar noun gbr? ?(the) man?. In our experiment all 
these variant readings are treated equally. 
5 Conclusions 
We hope to have shown how the analytical pro-
cedure (section 2) and the workflow of the word-
level analysis (section 3) meet the challenges of 
working with ancient documents (section 1), due 
to their form-to-function approach, their use of 
encoding rather than tagging, their distinction 
                                                 
6 26 forms ? 19 manuscripts = 494 forms in all the 
manuscripts together. Accordingly, the 5 (1+2?2) 
irregular forms make up 1%. 
between paradigmatic forms and their realiza-
tions, and because of the exigencies of accuracy 
in the case of an ancient limited corpus. 
In the word-level analysis we lean heavily on 
existing grammars. For that reason our approach 
could be regarded as theory-driven, even though 
we consider it one of our main tasks to revise and 
refine the paradigm on the basis of the actual 
corpora. Our encodings should be considered as 
hypotheses about the data that can be subjected 
to testing and experiment (section 4.6). 
Unlike projects that concern the acceleration 
of POS tagging (Ringger et al, 2007; Caroll et 
al., 2007) we start one level below, with the 
morphology. ?Encoding rather than tagging? is 
not just a practical, but a crucial methodological 
characteristic of our model. (For new insights 
that it produced regarding Syriac morphology see 
the publications by Bakker, Van Keulen and Van 
Peursen in the bibliography). We differ from the 
computer implementation of morphological rules 
(Kiraz, 2001) in that our work is more deductive 
and focused on the interaction between orthogra-
phy and morphology, because we start with the 
actual forms attested in the manuscripts. Our po-
sition in relation to these other projects is mainly 
determined by the philological demands that di-
rect our research (see section 1). 
Whereas at the morphological level the infor-
mation provided by traditional grammars is rela-
tively stable, at the higher linguistic levels they 
provide much less solid ground. The gradually 
built up datasets (analogous to the Analytical 
Lexicon at word level) of phrase patterns, clause 
patterns, or verbal valence contain much infor-
mation that is not properly dealt with in tradi-
tional grammars. At these levels the analysis be-
comes more data-oriented. Thus in the analysis 
of phrase structure Van Peursen (2007) found 
many complex patterns that have not been dealt 
with in traditional grammars. 
We have taken our examples from Syriac, but 
the same analytical procedures have been applied 
to other forms of Aramaic (Biblical Aramaic and 
Targum Aramaic) and Biblical Hebrew. Because 
of the separation of the analytical programs and 
the language-specific auxiliary files, it should be 
possible to apply it to other languages as well. 
This would mainly require writing the appropri-
ate language definition files. Although our model 
is in principle language-independent, the mor-
phological analysis presented in this paper is es-
pecially apt for Semitic languages because of 
their rich morphology.
