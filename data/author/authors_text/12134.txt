Abstract
A major obstacle to part-of-speech
(=POS) tagging of Northern Sotho
(Bantu, S 32) are ambiguous function
words. Many are highly polysemous and
very frequent in texts, and their local
context is not always distinctive.
With certain taggers, this issue leads to
comparatively poor results (between 88
and 92 % accuracy), especially when
sizeable tagsets (over 100 tags) are used.
We use the RF-tagger (Schmid and Laws,
2008), which is particularly designed for
the annotation of fine-grained tagsets (e.g.
including agreement information), and
we restructure the 141 tags of the tagset
proposed by Taljard et al (2008) in a way
to fit the RF tagger. This leads to over
94 % accuracy. Error analysis in addition
shows which types of phenomena cause
trouble in the POS-tagging of Northern
Sotho.
1 Introduction
In this paper, we discuss issues of the part-of-
speech (POS) tagging of Northern Sotho, one of
the eleven official languages of South Africa, spo-
ken in the North-east of the country. Northern
Sotho is a Bantu language belonging to the Sotho
family (Guthrie, 1967: S32). It is written disjunc-
tively (contrary to e.g. Zulu), i.e. certain mor-
phemes appear as character strings separated by
blank spaces. It makes use of 18 noun classes (1,
1a, 2, 2b, 3 to 10, 14, 15, and the locative classes
16, 17, 18, N-, which may be summarized as LOC
for their identical syntactic features). A concor-
dial system helps to verify agreement or resolve
ambiguities.
We address questions of the ambiguity of func-
tion words, in the framework of an attempt to use
?standard? European-style statistical POS taggers
on Northern Sotho texts.
In the remainder of this section, we briefly dis-
cuss our objectives (section 1.1) and situate our
work within the state of the art (section 1.2). Sec-
tion 2 deals with the main issues at stake, the han-
dling of unknown open class words, and the pol-
ysemy of Northern Sotho function words. In sec-
tion 3, we discuss our methodology, summarizing
the tagset and the tagging technique used, and re-
porting results from other taggers. Section 4 is
devoted to details of our own results, the effects
of the size of training material (4.2), the effects
of polysemy and reading frequency (4.3), and it
includes a discussion of proposals for quality im-
provement (Spoustova? et al, 2007). We conclude
in section 5.
1.1 Objectives
The long term perspective of our work is to sup-
port information extraction, lexicography, as well
as grammar development of Northern Sotho with
POS-tagged and possibly parsed corpus data. We
currently use the 5.5 million word University of
Pretoria Sepedi Corpus (PSC, cf. de Schryver
and Prinsloo (2000)), as well as a 45,000 words
training corpus. We aim at high accuracy in the
POS-tagging, and at minimizing the amount of un-
known word forms in arbitrary unseen corpora, by
using guessers for the open word classes.
1.2 Recent work
A few publications, so far, deal with POS-tagging
of Northern Sotho; most prominently, de Schryver
and de Pauw (2007) have presented the MaxTag
method, a tagger based on Maximum Entropy
38
Learning (Berger et al, 1996) as implemented in
the machine learning package Maxent (Le, 2004).
When trained on manually annotated text, it ex-
tracts features such as the first and last letter of
each word, or the first two and last two letters or
the first three and last three letters of each word;
it takes the word and the tag preceding and fol-
lowing the item to be tagged, etc., to decide about
word/tag probabilities. De Schryver and de Pauw
report an accuracy of 93.5 % on unseen data, using
a small training corpus of only ca. 10,000 word
forms.
Other work is only partly engaged in POS-
tagging, e.g. Kotze??s (2008) finite state analysis of
the verb complex of Northern Sotho. This study
does not cover all parts of speech and can thus not
be directly compared with our work. Taljard et al
(2008) and Van Rooy and Pretorius (2003) present
tagsets for Northern Sotho and the closely related
language Setswana, but they focus on the defini-
tion of the tagsets without discussing their auto-
matic application in detail. In (Prinsloo and Heid,
2005), POS-tagging is mentioned as a step in a
corpus processing pipeline for Northern Sotho, but
no experimental results are reported.
2 Challenges in tagging Northern Sotho
POS-tagging of Northern Sotho and of any dis-
junctively written Bantu language has to deal es-
pecially with two major issues which are con-
sequences of their morphology and their syntax.
One is the presence, in any unseen text, of a num-
ber of lexical items which are not covered by the
lexicon of the tagger (?unknown words?), and the
other is an extraordinarily high number of ambigu-
ous function words.
2.1 Unknown words
In Northern Sotho, nouns, verbs and adverbs are
open class items; all other categories are closed
word classes: their items can be listed. The open
classes are characterized in particular by a rich
morphology: nouns can form derivations to ex-
press diminutives and augmentatives, as well as
locative forms, to name just a few. Adding the
suffix -ng to toropo ?town?, for example, forms
toropong, ?in/at/to town?. For verbs, tense, voice,
mood and many other dimensions, as well as nom-
inalization, lead to an even larger number of de-
rived items. Prinsloo (1994) distinguishes 18 clus-
ters of verbal suffixes which give rise to over 260
individual derivation types per verb. Only a few
of these derivations are highly frequent in corpus
text; however, due to productivity, a large number
of verbal derivation types can potentially appear in
any unseen text.
For tagging, noun and verb derivations show up
as unknown items, and an attempt to cover them
within a large lexicon will partly fail due to pro-
ductivity and recursive applicability of certain af-
fixes. The impact of the unknown material on
tagging quality is evident: de Schryver and de
Pauw (2007) report 95.1 % accuracy on known
items, but only 78.9 % on unknowns; this leads
to a total accuracy of 93.5 % on their test corpus.
We have carried out experiments with a version
of the memory-based tagger, MBT (Daelemans et
al., 2007), which arrives at 90.67 % for the known
items of our own test corpus (see section 3.2), as
opposed to only 59.68 % for unknowns.
To counterbalance the effect of unknown items,
we use rule-based and partly heuristic guessers for
noun and verb forms (cf. Prinsloo et al (2008) and
(Heid et al, 2008)) and add their results to the tag-
ger lexicon before applying the statistical tagger:
the possible annotations for all words contained in
the text are thus part of the knowledge available to
the tagger.
Adverbs are also an open word class in North-
ern Sotho; so far, we have no tools for identifying
them. In high quality tagging, the suggestions of
our guessers are examined manually, before they
are added to the tagger lexicon.
2.2 Polysemous function words and
ambiguity
Function words of Northern Sotho are highly am-
biguous, and because of the disjunctive writing
system of the language, a number of bound mor-
phemes are written separately from other words.
A single form can have several functions. For
example, the token -a- is nine-ways ambiguous:
it can be a subject concord of noun class 1 or 6,
an object concord of class 6, a possessive concord
of class 6, a demonstrative of class 6, a hortative
or a question particle or a verbal morpheme in-
dicating present tense or past tense (Appendix A
illustrates the ambiguity of -a- with example sen-
tences). Furthermore, the most polysemous func-
tion words are also the most frequent word types in
corpora. The highly ambiguous item go1 alone ac-
111 different functions of go may be distinguished: object
39
counts for over 5 % of all occurrences in our train-
ing corpus, where 88 types of function words, with
an average frequency of well over 200, make up
for about 40 % of all occurrences.
The different readings of the function words are
not evenly distributed: some are highly frequent,
others are rare. Furthermore, many ambiguous
function words appear in the context of other func-
tion words; thus the local context does not nec-
essarily disambiguate individual function words.
This issue is particularly significant with ambigu-
ities between concords which can have the same
function (e.g. object) in different noun classes. As
mentioned, -a- can be a subject concord of either
noun class 1 or 6: though there are some clearcut
cases, like the appearance of a noun of class 6 (in-
dicating class 6), or an auxiliary or the conjunction
ge in the left context (both rather indicating class
1) there still remain a number of occurrences of -a-
in the corpora only where a broader context, some-
times even information from preceding sentences,
may help to disambiguate this item.
Consequently, comparing tagging performance
across different tagsets does not give very clear re-
sults: if a tagset, like the one used by de Schryver
and de Pauw (2007), does not distinguish noun
classes, obviously a large number of difficult dis-
ambiguation cases does not appear at all (their
tagset distinguishes, for example, subject and ob-
ject concord, but gives no information on noun
class numbers). For the lexicographic applica-
tion we are interested in, and more generally as a
preparatory step to chunking or parsing of North-
ern Sotho texts, an annotation providing informa-
tion on noun classes is however highly desirable.
3 Methodology
3.1 Tagset
There are several proposals for tagsets to be used
for Northern Sotho and related languages. Van
Rooy and Pretorius (2003) propose a detailed
tagset for Setswana, which is fully in line with
the guidelines stated by the EAGLES project, cf.
Leech and Wilson (1999). This tagset encodes a
considerable number of semantic distinctions in
its nominal and verbal tags. In Kotze??s work on
concord of class 15, object concord of the locative classes,
object concord of the 2nd person singular, subject concord
of class 15, indefinite subject concord, subject concord of
the locative classes, class prefix of class 15, locative particle,
copulative indicating either an indefinite subject, or a subject
of class 15 or a locative subject.
the Northern Sotho verb complex, (Kotze?, 2008),
a number of POS tags are utilized to distinguish
the elements of the verb, however, due to Kotze??s
objectives, her classification does not cover other
items. De Schryver and de Pauw (2007) use a
tagset of only 56 different tags, whereas the pro-
posal by Van Rooy and Pretorius leads to over 100
tags. Finally, Taljard et al (2008) propose a rather
detailed tagset: contrary to the other authors men-
tioned, they do encode noun classes in all relevant
tags, which leads to a total of 141 tags. Further-
more, they encode a number of additional mor-
phosyntactic distinctions on a second level of their
tagset, which leads to a total of 262 different clas-
sifications of Northern Sotho morphemes.
Our current tagset is inspired by Taljard et al
(2008). However, we disregard some of their sec-
ond level information for the moment (which in
many cases encodes lexical properties of the items,
e.g. the subdivision of particles: hortative, ques-
tion, instrumental, locative, connective, etc.). We
use the RF-tagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008) (cf.
section 3.3), which is geared towards the annota-
tion of structured tagsets, by separating informa-
tion which partitions the inventory of forms (e.g.
broad word classes) from feature-like information
possibly shared by several classes, such as the
Sotho noun classes. With this method, we are able
to account for Taljard et al?s (2008) 141 tags by
means of only 25 toplevel tags, plus a number of
feature-like labels of lower levels. We summarize
the properties of the tagsets considered in table 1.
3.2 Training corpus
Our training corpus consists of ca. 45.000 manu-
ally annotated word forms, from two text types.
Over 20.000 word forms come from a novel of
the South African author Oliver K. Matsepe (Mat-
sepe, 1974); over 10.000 forms come from a Ph.D.
dissertation by Raphehli M. Thobakgale (Thobak-
gale, 2005), and another 10.000 from a second
Ph.D. dissertation, by Ramalau R. Maila (Maila,
2006). Obviously, this is not a balanced corpus; it
was indeed chosen because of its easy accessibil-
ity. We use this corpus to train our taggers and to
test them; in a ten-fold cross validation, we split
the text into ten slices of roughly equal size, train
on 9 of them and test on the tenth. In this article,
we give figures for the median of these results.

3.3 Tagging techniques: the RF-tagger
We opt for the RF-tagger (Schmid and Laws,
2008), because it is a Hidden-Markov-Model
(HMM) tagger which was developed especially
for POS tagsets with a large number of (fine-
grained) tags. Tests with our training corpus have
shown that this tagger outperforms the Tree-tagger
((Schmid, 1994) and (Schmid, 1995)), as shown in
figure 1. An additional external lexicon may serve
as input, too. The development of the RF-tagger
was based on the widely shared opinion that for
languages like German or Czech, agreement in-
formation (e.g. case, number or person) should
preferably appear as part of all appropriate part
of speech tags. However, as tagsets increase im-
mensely in size when such information is part of
the tags, the data are decomposed, i.e. split into
several levels of processing. The probability of
each level is then calculated separately (the joint
probability of all levels is afterwards calculated as
their product). With such methodology, a tag of
the German determiner das may contain five levels
of information, e.g. ART.Def.Nom.Sg.Neut to de-
fine a definite, nominative singular, neutral deter-
miner (article) that appears in the nominative case.
This approach makes sense for the Bantu-
languages as well, since information on noun class
numbers should be part of the noun tags, too, as in
Taljard et als (2008) tagset. A noun here is not
only tagged ?N?, but Nclass, e.g. mohumagadi
?(married) woman? as N01. All concords, pro-
nouns or other types that concordially agree with
nouns are also labelled with a class number, e.g.
o, the subject concord of class 1, is labelled CS01.
This approach makes sense, especially in the view
of chunking/parsing and reference resolution, be-
cause any of those elements can acquire a pronom-
inal function when the noun that they refer to is
deleted (Louwrens, 1991).
To utilize the RF-tagger, we split all tags con-
taining noun class numbers into several levels (e.g.
the tag N01 becomes N.01). Emphatic and posses-
sive pronouns are represented on three levels (e.g.
PROPOSSPERS becomes PRO.POSS.PERS)2.
4 Results
In a preliminary experiment, we compared several
taggers3 on our manually annotated data. Apart
from the RF-tagger (Schmid and Laws, 2008),
we also used the Tree-Tagger (Schmid, 1994), the
TnT tagger (Brants, 2000) and MBT (Daelemans
et al, 2007).
4.1 Comparing taggers
The results give a relatively homogenous picture,
with the RF-tagger achieving a median of 94.16 %
when utilising a lexicon containing several thou-
sand nouns and verbs. It leads to 91 % accuracy
without this lexicon (to simulate similar condi-
tions as for TnT or MBT where no external lex-
icon was offered). TnT achieves 91.01 %, and
MBT 87.68 %. Data from the Tree-Tagger were
not comparable for they had been obtained at an
earlier stage using the lexicon (92.46 %).
4.2 Effects of the size of the training corpus
on the tagging results
All probabilistic taggers are in need of training
data the size of which depends on the size of the
tagset and on the frequencies of occurrence of
each context. De Schryver and de Pauw (2007)
demonstrated that when utilizing a tagset that con-
tains only about a third of the tags (56) contained
in Taljard et al?s (2008) tagset (141), their Max-
Tag POS-tagger reaches a 93.5 % accuracy with a
training corpus of only about 10,000 tokens.
Figure 1 depicts the effects of the size of the
training corpus on the accuracy figures of the Tree-
tagger and the RF-tagger. Tests with training cor-
pora of the sizes 15,000, 30,000 and 45,000 tokens
2Tests have shown that the quantitative pronouns should
be treated separately, their tags are thus only split into two
levels.
3Check the References section for the availability of these
taggers.
41

on tagger results.
showed that the results might not improve much if
more data is added. The RF-tagger already reaches
more than 94 % correctness when utilizing the cur-
rent 45,000 token training corpus.
4.3 Effects of the highly polysemous function
words of Northern Sotho
The less frequently a token-label pair appears in
the corpus, the lower is its probability (leading to
the sparse data problem, when probability guesses
become unreliable because of low numbers of oc-
currences). This issue poses a problem for North-
ern Sotho function words: if they occur very fre-
quently with a certain label, the chances of them
being detected with another label are fairly low.
This effect is demonstrated in table 2, which de-
scribes the detection of the parts of speech of the
highly ambiguous function word -a-. The word -
a- as PART(icle) occurs only 45 times while -a-
as CS.01 occurs 1,182 times. More than 50 % of
the particle occurrences (23) are wrongly labelled
CS.01 by the tagger. In table 2, we list the cor-
rect tags of all occurrences of -a-, as well as the
assigned tags to each of them by our tagger. Each
block of table 2 is ordered by decreasing numbers
of occurrence of each tag in the output of the RF-
tagger. For easier reference, the correct tags as-
signed by the RF-tagger are printed in bold. Table
2 also clearly shows the effect of ambiguous local
context on the tagging result: the accuracy of the
CS.06-annotation (subject concord of class 6) is
considerably lower than that of the more frequent
CS.01 (96.45 % vs. 63.08 %), and CS.01 is the
most frequent error in the CS.06 assignment pro-

4.4 Suggestions for increasing correctness
percentages
Spoustova? et al (2007) describe a significant in-
crease of accuracy in statistical tagging when uti-
lizing rule-based macros as a preprocessing, for
Czech. We have contemplated, in an earlier stage
of our work (Prinsloo and Heid, 2005) to adopt a
42
similar strategy, i.e. to design rule-based macros
for the (partial) disambiguation of high-frequency
function words. However, the fact that the local
context of many function words is similar (i.e. the
ambiguity of this local context (see above)), is a
major obstacle to a disambiguation of single func-
tion words by means of rules. Rules would interact
in many ways, be dependent on the application or-
der, or disambiguate only partially (i.e. leave sev-
eral tag options). An alternative would be to de-
sign rules for the disambiguation of word or mor-
pheme sequences. This would however amount to
partial parsing. The status of such rules within a
tagging architecture would then be unclear.
4.5 Effects of tagset size and structure
While a preprocessing with rule-based disam-
biguation does not seem to be promising, there
are other methods of improving accuracy, such as,
e.g., the adaptation of the tagset. Obviously, types
appearing in different contexts should have differ-
ent labels. For example, in the tagset of Taljard et
al. (2008), auxiliary verbs are a sub-class of verbs
(V aux). In typical Northern Sotho contexts, how-
ever, auxiliaries are surrounded by subject con-
cords, while verbs are only preceded by them.
When ?promoting? the auxiliaries to the first level
by labelling them VAUX, the RF-tagger result in-
creases by 0.13 % to 94.16 % accuracy. We still
see room for further improvement here. For exam-
ple, ga as PART (either locative particle PART loc
or hortative particle PART hort) is identified cor-
rectly in only 29.2 % of all cases at the moment.
The hortative particle usually appears at the be-
ginning of a verbal segment, while the locative in
most cases follows the segment. Results may in-
crease to an even higher accuracy when ?promot-
ing? these second level annotations, hort(ative) and
loc(ative) to the first annotation level.
5 Conclusions and future work
This article gives an overview of work on POS-
tagging for Northern Sotho. Depending on the
place of tagging in an overall NLP chain for this
language, different choices with respect to the
tagset and to the tagging technology may prove
adequate.
In our work, which is part of a detailed lin-
guistic annotation of Northern Sotho corpora for
linguistic exploration with a view to lexicons and
grammars, it is vital to provide a solid basis for
chunking and/or parsing, by including informa-
tion on noun class numbers in the annotation.
We found that the RF-tagger (Schmid and Laws,
2008) performs well on this task, partly because
it allows us to structure the tagset into layers, and
to deal with noun class information in the same
way as with agreement features for European lan-
guages. We reach over 94 % correctness, which
indicates that at least a first attempt at covering the
PSC corpus may now be in order.
Our error analysis, however, also highlights a
few more general aspects of the POS annotation
of Northern Sotho and related languages: obvi-
ously, frequent items and items in distinctive lo-
cal contexts are tagged quite well. When noun
class information is part of the distinctions under-
lying the tagset, function words usable for more
than one noun class tend however, to appear in
non-distinctive local contexts and thus to lead to
a considerable error rate. Furthermore, we found a
few cases of uses of, e.g., subject concords that are
anaphoric, with antecedents far away and thus not
accessible to tagging procedures based on the lo-
cal context. These facts raise the question whether,
to achieve the highest quality of lexical classifica-
tion of the words and morphemes of a text, chunk-
ing/parsing might be required altogether, rather
than tagging.
Our experiments also showed that several pa-
rameters are involved in fine-tuning a Sotho tag-
ger. The size and structure of the tagset is one
such a prominent parameter. Tendencies towards
simpler and smaller tagsets obviously conflict with
the needs of advanced processing of the texts and
of linguistically demanding applications. It seems
that tagset design and tool development go hand in
hand.
We intend to apply the current version of the
RF-tagger to the PSC corpus and to evaluate the
results carefully. We expect a substantial gain
from the use of the guessers for nouns and verbs,
cf. (Prinsloo et. al, 2008) and (Heid et al, 2008).
Detailed error analysis should allow us to also
design specific rules to correct the output of the
tagger. Instead of preprocessing (as proposed by
Spoustova? et al (2007)), a partial postprocess-
ing may contribute to further improving the overall
quality. Rules would then probably have to be ap-
plied to particular sequences of words and/or mor-
phemes which cause difficulties in the statistical
process.
