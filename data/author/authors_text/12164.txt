Abstract 
 
In this paper, we propose the development of 
the Question-Answering Services System for 
the Farmer, through SMS, by focusing on 
query analysis and annotation based on a simi-
lar technique previously applied to language 
generation, thematic roles, and primitive sys-
tems of the Lexical Conceptual Structure 
(LCS).  The annotation places emphasis on the 
semantics model of ?What? and ?How? que-
ries, lexical inference identification, and se-
mantic role, for the answer. Finally, we show 
how these annotations and inference rules con-
tribute to the generalization of the matching 
system over semantic categories in order to 
have a large scale question-answering system. 
1    Challenges and Goals 
In the era of Information and Communications 
Technology (ICT), mobile is a fast and conven-
ient way to communicate over a network. 
Knowledge service via a mobile as ?a right in-
formation for a right man? is a challenging task. 
However, this means of interchange between 
persons has the limitation of personal timing. 
Therefore, Short Message Service (SMS) is a 
better way for giving knowledge service, espe-
cially automatic interchange of short text mes-
sages, by providing the information from an 
automatic Question & Answering System.  
From the results of the statistical ICT data 
survey concerning the number and percent of the 
population 6 years of age and over who use in-
formation and communication technology: 2003 
- 2007 by the National Statistical Office1, Thai-
land, it was found that  47.2% of people in the 
entire kingdom have owned their mobile(s). 
Consequently, communicating via SMS facili-
tates an effective knowledge service for support-
ing the farmers in problem-solving, decision 
making, and early warning, and also supports the 
government, or a related organization, in order to 
e-communicate to the farmer by changing the 
model of ?Training and Visit? to e-service and 
changing the collective to support cooperative 
problem solving. This kind of communication 
will provide the necessary long-term cost reduc-
tions to the agricultural economy in the areas of 
travel, visiting, productivity, etc.  
Nowadays, providing a knowledge service 
through SMS is not limited to only a Question-
Answering Services System, but also for such 
one-way services as early warning systems, for 
example, a Tsunami Alert System2, a FloodSMS 
? Early Detection and Warning of Catastrophic 
Flooding via SMS3, etc. 
The development of a Question-Answering 
Services System through SMS is not the design 
of a new technology. There have been several 
theories developed earlier, in the context of NLP 
or cognitive sciences, such as Natural Language 
Information Retrieval (NLIR), rule based Q&A, 
etc.  Nevertheless, some former theories of Q&A 
relied on complex semantic information. For in-
stance, a Wireless Natural Language Search En-
gine [6] was implemented using a system resid-

ing on a server, which can translate questions or 
phrases into search engine queries or queries to 
SOAP Web services, where a gateway mediates 
between the mobile network and the Internet. 
Also, [15] developed the SMS for Question-
Answering in the m-Learning Scenario System 
by using the Simple Matching Algorithm to 
match the learners? answer messages with the 
original answer string, thus facilitating the learn-
ers to get the necessary feedback and assessment.  
In this paper, we propose the development of 
the Question-Answering Services System for the 
Farmer through SMS by focusing on query 
analysis and annotation, as well as on selected 
text matching utilizing lexical inference and se-
mantic roles. The annotation emphasizes the se-
mantics model of ?What? and ?How? queries. 
Finally, we show how these annotations and in-
ference rules contribute to the generalization of 
the matching system over semantic categories in 
order to have a large scale question-answering 
system.  
In the current stage, we have designed Q&A 
schema with thematic roles and have borrowed 
some primitive systems of the Lexical Concep-
tual Structure (LCS). Also, we are annotating 
1000 questions and text related to the query (but 
we randomly choose 100 pairs of Q&A for the 
experiment). In the same time, we are generaliz-
ing inference rules in order to match a question 
to its answer. This is particularly crucial when 
there is no straightforward response, e.g. when 
they require some form of lexical inference, 
elaboration, and reasoning or when the response 
is not a simple item, but a well-formed fragment 
of text, e.g. a chain of events leading to a conse-
quence, a procedure, etc.  
The project we present here emerged from a 
need of the real end-users, the Agricultural Land 
Reform Office, Ministry of Agriculture and Co-
operative, Thailand, in the project of ALRO Cy-
berBrain [3], which is a social network frame-
work that combines approaches based on knowl-
edge science and engineering with language en-
gineering, consisting of an ontology-based search 
engine, information extraction for Q&A system, 
knowledge aggregation through a knowledge 
portal and visualized in a browser with semantic 
links between problems, methods of problems 
solving and man who is the problem solver 
(PMM map Model) [1]. The main goal is to de-
velop tools for e-Farming, in particular rice farm-
ing, so that farmers can easily get information on 
farming rice and rice diseases. Now, it has been 
extended to provide question-answering services 
for the farmers through SMS [2].  
2    Problem Statements 
There are two main problems in Q&A analy-
sis: semantic interpretation for a question word 
and answer identification. 
2.1    Question?s Semantic Roles 
2.1.1    Question Word Interpretation.  
In general, when we query for the answer by a 
traditional search engine system, we might get 
many answers at different levels, depending on 
the role of the question: Definition vs Fact or set 
of Facts.  For example, with the question  
Q1: ????|????|???|????? 
     Rice| Blast| is| what 
    ?What is a Rice Blast??  
The answer can be returned as the definitions, 
fact or a set of facts, which are: 
A1.1: Blast, also called rotten neck, is one of the 
most destructive diseases of Missouri rice. 
Blast does not develop every year but is 
very destructive when it occurs.4   
A1.2:   Disease of Leave Burnt caused by Pyricu-
laria Oryzae can destroy all rice growing 
period  from start until harvest period.5 
The answer can be returned as the characteris-
tics detail or set of facts, such as the following: 
A1.3 : Blast symptoms can occur on leaves, 
leaf collars, nodes and panicles. Leaf spots are 
typically diamond shaped, with gray- white cen-
ters and brown to red-brown margins. Fully de-
veloped leaf lesions are approximately 0.4 to 0.7 
inch long and 0.1 to 0.2 inch wide. Both the 
shape and color vary depending on the environ-
ment, age of the lesion and rice variety.6  
2.1.2    Variety of Question Forms.  
In natural language, the question can be asked 
with different words and styles, for example:  
Q2.1:??????|????????|???|???|????|????|??????? 
situation| outbreak| of| disease| Rice Blast| 
is| how  
?What is the situation of Rice Blast?? 
Q2.2:????????|???|???|????|??|??????|??????? 
outbreak| of| disease| Rice Blast| is| characteristic| how 
     ?How does the rice blast outbreak look like??

5  http://www.sotus.co.th/article_4.html 
6  http://aes.missouri.edu/delta/muguide/mp645.stm

Q2.3:???|????|?????|???|??????? 
Rice Blast| disperse| able| how 
?How can the rice blast disperse?? 
The reply can be returned the same answers 
with a descriptive set of events, as the following: 
A2.1: To prevent the Rice Blast: for the places 
that we often found the disease, use the dis-
ease-resistant rice variety. Don't sow the 
rice seed too densely. Don't use to much Ni-
trogen. If it is severe outbreak and it is the 
state of young plant, plow and sow again. If 
it was the epidemic state, use Fungus-
Removal chemical as Carbendasim. 
A2.2: Brown spot may be reduced by balanced 
fertilization, crop rotation, and the use of 
high quality planting seed. Seed treatment 
fungicides reduce the incidence and severity 
of seedling blight caused by this fungus. 
The examples above show that using different 
verbs or noun phrases can be represent the same 
meaning. Moreover, there is non-correspondent 
focus word between Q and A. 
2.2    Answer Type Identification 
2.2.1    Ambiguity between subtopic and an-
swer form 
To identify the answer, sometimes there is an 
ambiguity that verb phrases occurring after the 
focus word of the question can be both subtopics 
and the answer, like a procedural answer, for 
example,: 
Q3: ???????|???????|???|????|???|???|??????? 
 method| control| Rice Blast| to do| how 
 ?What method can be used to control Rice 
Blast??  
A3:  ???????|???????|???|????|??|?????? 
 method| control| Rice Blast| have| such as 
?Methods for preventing the Rice Blast are:? 
? ???|???????|???|??????? 
 use| Chemical Substance | that| appropriate 
?Use appropriate Chemical Substance.? 
? ???|??????|???|??????? 
 use| type of rice | that| appropriate 
?Use appropriate type of rice.? 
? ???|????|??|???|??????? 
 use| mechanism| in| prevent 
?Use mechanism to prevent.? 
? ???|???????|??????? 
 use| methods| hybrid 
?Use hybrid  methods.? 
The examples above convey the 4 types of 
method for Rice Blast control or names of meth-
ods, but it is not the process or the answers that 
represent how to control the disease. 
2.2.2    Non-correspondence between Q & A: 
Sometimes, the question and answer were not 
matched because the clue words or focus words 
in the question have never appeared in the an-
swers. This makes the question not correspond to 
the answer and also causes difficulty in finding 
the expected answer. For example, 
Q4: ??????|??????|????|?????|????|????????|???|??????? 
can| control| pests | rice | these | How  
?How can these rice pests be controlled??  
A4: ????|?????|????????|??????|??????|???|???|???|???????|????|
??????|???|???| |???| |????|????|??????|???????|???|,| |????|
????|???|??????|, |??????|?????|????|??|?? |???|???|???|???|
???|???|????|???|???|???|????|???|?????|?????||???|???| 
?These pests can be managed through inte-
grated approach including sowing insect re-
sistant rice varieties, sowing rice crop at rec-
ommended time, proper water management 
conservation and augmentation of bio-control 
predators.? 
From the example, the focus word of the 
question is ?control,? but there is no word ?con-
trol? in the answer. For this kind of Q&A match-
ing solution, WordNet and ontology are neces-
sary. 
3    Outline of the Project and Methodol-
ogy  
The needs of the Thai Ministry of Agriculture 
have been specified in a simple way via a corpus 
composed of (1) questions raised in real life by 
farmers (about 1000 questions), (2) the responses 
which have been provided by experts, based on 
existing documents (possibly several responses 
per question) and, quite often, (3) the texts they 
originate from. In general, the response is found 
in a unique text: there are no multiple answers, 
since most texts are not redundant, although 
some responses, in particular complex (e.g. 
evaluative questions) or indirect ones, may in-
volve the taking into account of several inde-
pendent texts. We will not address here the prob-
lem of message length reduction so that it fits 
into an SMS format (although this is also an im-
portant semantic problem). 
The system overview is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. System Architecture 
To develop a Thai QA system, the preprocess-
ing of Thai morphology and syntax is necessary. 
The NAIST lab at the University of Kasetsart has 
basic tools to manage morphological analysis, 
parts-of-speech recognition, simple syntactic 
analysis, as well as Thai parsing, and an Element 
Discourse Unit System (EDU). These tools were 
designed as basic tools in natural language proc-
essing applications. (accessible on 
http://vivaldi.cpe.ku.ac.th:9292/ with a recom-
mendation to use the Mozilla Firefox browser) 
A few examples of question-answer pairs are: 
Q5:  ???????|???????|??????|????|??????|???|???|??????? 
?How to prevent the Weedy rice? 
A5.1: ???|????|????|????|???|??? 
?Skip some seasons when growing rice,? 
A5.2: ????|???|???|?????|???? 
?Grow hydrotonics plants.? 
Q6:  ???|??|???|?????|???|??|???????|??????|??????? 
?How to control the Bacterial Leaf 
Streak  Disease? 
A6: ???|???|???|????|????????|???|??????| 
  ?Do not put too much Nitrogen.? 
Q7:  ???|??|??????|??|?????| |??????|??????|????|???|
???|????|????|?? 
?How to eradicate the rice thrips? 
A7:  ???|???|????|?????????|????|?????????|???|???????|  |
???|????|???|???|????|???| |?| |???|??? 
?Spray with Malathion or Carbaryl 
every week, add fertilizer and water 
every two days.? 
Questions are essentially factoid questions 
(e.g. best periods for rice planting, rice varieties 
suggestion, symptoms of a disease), why ques-
tions, where responses are chains of events (rea-
sons for something to happen) and a large num-
ber of procedural questions [4], in particular for 
treating diseases. There are relatively few com-
parative or evaluative questions besides general 
questions, such as: What are the major rice 
pests? 
In most cases, questions do not have responses 
which can be immediately found in the texts by 
standard term matching techniques. For example: 
?How does the Sheath Blight affect the rice 
growth?? has the following response in a text: 
Plants heavily infected at these stages produce 
poorly filled grain, particularly in the lower por-
tion of the panicle. Additional losses result from 
... Therefore, some lexical semantics devices 
(e.g. a semantic link between affect and infect) or 
more elaborated reasoning schemas, based on 
domain knowledge, are needed to allow appro-
priate question-text matching [11, 7]. The kind of 
domain knowledge at stake may be quite unex-
pected (i.e., not the main topics that everyone 
knows, but more subtle pieces of information, as 
will be seen in 4.3). This is the major challenge 
of this work, which we try to resolve via a full 
annotation of the matching process, from ques-
tion parsing to response production, identifying 
matching and reasoning aspects. 
Complex questions may, e.g., require the 
elaboration of a diagnosis from premises given in 
the question before finding the response, either 
factoid or procedural (My rice has weedy leaves 
and some yellow spots, what should I do?). This 
question requires one to select all texts where 
such a symptom is identified, and then, e.g., to 
enter into a dialogue with the user if there are 
several possible diagnoses, leading to different 
treatments. 
The second aspect of this problem is to be able 
to extract the complete text portion that responds 
to the question. For that purpose we are develop-
ing an annotation methodology whose goal is to 
identify the different processes at stake and the 
needed resources. This method allows us to iden-
tify relevant text portions and then to delimit 
them appropriately. 
4    The Question-Answering Process An-
notation 
Since the task is quite large (a large group of stu-
dents are annotating a set of 600 questions and 
related texts), we need to establish norms and 
annotation guidelines. Using the research con-
ducted at IRIT on annotating procedural ques-
tions and instructions based on semantic roles

(TextCoop project) and a few rhetorical relations 
(e.g. elaboration, example, explanation), we first 
annotated the questions and their corresponding 
responses in texts provided by the Thai Ministry 
of Agriculture. One of the challenges was to 
identify relevant linguistic marks or patterns [9, 
10, 14]. 
There are many attempts to annotate argu-
ments by means of primitives; our approach, 
here, is oriented towards the precise task at stake 
and the specific actions. Therefore roles are not 
as standard as they are in general. An earlier at-
tempt with a similar technique applied to lan-
guage generation was carried out in, e.g., [10, 7]. 
Semantic tags are either close to thematic roles 
(instrument, location, etc.) [8], or borrowed from 
the primitive systems of the Lexical Conceptual 
Structure (LCS) [13], in particular, to establish 
useful links between arguments or between a 
large variety of constituents, which thematic 
roles cannot do. For example, in the first Thai 
university we have a link between 'first' and 'Thai 
university' which is either loctemp or loc+char+ident, 
depending on the interpretation of first (oldest or 
the best). However, in a majority of cases, se-
mantic roles based on thematic roles have a suf-
ficient granularity, and these are the ones which 
are used in the examples in 4.1. 
The main roles we consider are: agents (for 
humans and animals like insects, and metaphori-
cally for diseases and natural forces), themes 
(undergoing actions, basically plants and soils, 
and artificial products), location (spatial), time 
(covering dates and also periods), instruments 
(from tools to chemical products), manners, 
means, conditions (under which to realize an ac-
tion, or related to observation e.g. of a disease), 
cause, goals, and results. 
Besides, the tags <action>?</action> or 
<fact>?</fact> were considered to tag the verb 
with it?s arguments or adjuncts. 
In the remainder of this section we briefly re-
port the different steps of the process as they 
stand at the moment, i.e. almost at the end of the 
experimental stage, before automating knowl-
edge acquisition, and implementing the applica-
tion. 
4.1    Dealing with Questions 
As in most systems dealing with complex types 
of questions, questions are represented by a tri-
ple: the question type (which can be in our case 
polymorphic), the question focus (usually an NP 
or a VP in case events or procedures are induced) 
and the question body, annotated by means of 
semantic roles, as indicated above. 
The main types of questions we have identi-
fied from our corpus are the following; they are 
quite different from standard classifications, but 
they correspond to more operational views: 
F: fact, with subtypes: temp (temporal, time, 
date), loc (location) or product, 
E: an event (with a subtype event: cause)  
SF: set of facts  
SE: set of events (not related, and without any 
form of sequence: different from SqE be-
low)  
PROC: procedure, more or less complex, it 
may be just a single instruction; it can also 
describe the use of an instrument.  
SqE: sequence of events, which follow each 
other.  
EVAL: evaluation, making value decisions 
about issues or resolving controversies or 
differences of opinion.  
DEF: definition, the description of object.  
Some questions may bear several non-
conflicting types, in particular when the nature of 
the response is not straightforward to determine 
from the question. For example, ?What is the 
symptom of Bakanae?? would get the types SF 
and SE. 
An annotated question is, for example: 
 
As can be noted, the response is the set of 
those facts that contribute, together or independ-
ently, to the spreading of the disease. 
By the observation from 100 random inter-
rogative sentences corpus analysis, we found that 
the semantic types of questions correspondent to 
the question words are the following 
Q-Types What When Where Why Who Which How 
F 11 6 1   1 9 2 
E       1     6 
SF 3         15 3 
SE 7         2 5 
PROC             15 
SqE             7 
EVAL 2       1     
DEF 3             
Table 1 the correspondence between questions 
and semantic types of questions 
From Table 1, it is clear that ?what? and 
?how? questions vary in types of question, be-
cause they have many forms to use, for example, 
?how + verb to be + noun?, ?how + do(es) + 
noun + verb?, ?how to?, ?how can?, etc. or  
?what + verb to be + noun?, ?what + noun + 
auxiliary verb?, etc. This is why we point out the 
?What? and ?How? questions. 
<question type=? SF or SE? focus=? symptom of 
Bakanae?> What <fact> is <theme> the symp-
tom of Bakanae </theme> </fact> ? </question>
7
4.2    Dealing with texts: document indexing 
and associated annotations 
Texts are initially indexed based on the main 
terms they contain which are relevant w.r.t. the 
questions given in the corpus. Our representation 
resembles a frame approach, but it is more 
flexible since there is no predefined structure to 
represent indexes. This is more in accordance 
with the variety of texts in terms of contents. In-
dexes basically are formed from: 
? Top-level terms that structure the domain: 
for example, concepts like symptom, 
spreading, treatment, time, place, effect, 
etc. where predicative (action terms) terms 
as well as entities are found, 
? relatively generic terms, found in the 
questions and structured in the domain on-
tology: water, clean, control, eradicate, 
etc., which are organized w.r.t. the top 
concepts above, 
? named entities, typed as: disease names, 
location names, chemical product names, 
bacteria names, etc. 
In our representation, those generic terms (and 
near synonyms) are represented as predicates, 
while arguments are represented as attribute-
value pairs (or attributes alone), include typed 
name entities and any kind of terms besides the 
generic terms.  
Indexes are associated with texts in the text 
database. Indexes must remain general so that 
indexing is fast and as reliable as possible. The 
idea is that when a question is uttered, a small 
number of texts are first selected on the basis of 
the indexes for further analysis. An example  
below can be indexed and annotated [2] as the 
following: 
 
Index: disease-name (Bakanae), symptoms (disease: Bakanae), 
origin (disease: Bakanae, place: California, date: 1999), spread-
ing(disease: Bakanae, period: winter, medium: [soil, water]), treat-
ment(disease: Bakanae, product). 
 
<title type=?goal? level=?1? > Rice Bakanae </title> 
<title type=?goal? level=?2?>SYMPTOMS </title> 
  <task type = ?SF?>  
<theme>Symptoms of Bakanae</theme> first appear about a 
month after planting. Infected seedlings appear to be taller, more 
slender, and slightly chlorotic ... The rapid elongation of infected 
plants is caused by the pathogen?s production of the plant hormone, 
gibberellin.....</task> 
 
<title type=?goal? level=?2?>COMMENTS ON THE DISEASE 
</title> 
Bakanae is one of the oldest known diseases of rice in Asia but has 
only been observed in California rice since 1999 and now occurs in 
all California rice-growing regions. While very damaging in Asia, 
the extent to which Bakanae may effect California rice production 
is unknown. As diseased plants ..... 
 
4.3   Matching selected texts with questions: 
the deep indexing level 
The main words of the question focus and body 
are used to select a subset of indexed texts as 
potential candidates containing the response. 
Then, in each of these texts, the few sentences 
where the terms of the question or derived terms 
(closely related terms) are effectively found are 
annotated by means of semantic roles as for the 
question, for further analysis and investigations.  
For that purpose, we have developed guide-
lines for annotating those text fragments where 
the response is and the associated knowledge, 
based on the same semantic roles as those used 
in the questions. These annotations remain so far 
exploratory, in terms of feasibility and automa-
tion. Our major concern is to develop a method 
for annotators so that a large number of texts can 
be tagged homogeneously and also so that the 
technique can be reproduced for other technical 
areas. Finally, in terms of response identification, 
the goal is to define a metric that defines the best 
match and selects the text fragment(s) that best 
respond(s) to the question among several poten-
tial candidates. 
Let us first consider a simple example. Given 
the question: 
Q8: ?How to eradicate Bakanae ??  
with the following representation: 
 
The main terms of the question are ?eradicate? 
and ?Bakanae?. The text above is therefore se-
lected on the basis of its indexes, because ?treat-
ment? is a closely related term (in terms of se-
mantic relation: ?way to realize an event?) of 
?eradicate? in the domain ontology. 
Then, the question terms are searched in the 
selected text and the sentences that contain them 
are annotated using semantic roles. For example, 
the following sentence is a candidate: 
The most effective means to treat this disease 
is the use of noninfested seeds.  
It is tagged as: 
<title type=?goal? level=?2?>MANAGEMENT</title> 
<task type = ?PROC?>  
The most effective means to<action> treat <theme> this disease 
</theme> </action> is the <instruction compound><instruction 
type="imperative">use of noninfested seed</instruction>. 
Also,<connector type="advice"> when possible</connector>, <ad-
vice>burning plant residues</advice> with known infection in fall 
may help limit the disease. ..... Field trials indicate that a seed treat-
ment with sodium hypochlorite (Ultra Clorox Germicidal Bleach) is 
effective at reducing the incidence of this disease.... </instruction 
compound></task> 
<question type=?PROC or SqE? focus ?eradi-
cate Bakanae? > How to <action> eradicate 
<theme> Bakanae </theme>  </action> ? 
</question> 
8
 
The answer is the above sentence and the text 
fragment that follows (introduced by the connec-
tor also) since the response is of type procedure: 
The most effective means to treat this disease 
is the use of noninfested seed. Also, when possi-
ble, burning plant residues with known infection 
in fall may help limit the disease. 
Following [5], this structure is annotated as a 
single instructional compound, which is the fun-
damental unit in a procedural text. This is the 
structure which is typically returned to users. 
Let us present here another illustrative exam-
ple of a text fragment where the response is an-
notated together with the required related reason-
ing elements: 
Q9: ?How can thrips destroy the rice ?? 
annotation: 
 
The text fragment that corresponds to the an-
swer is annotated as follows: 
 
To match the action ?destroy? in the question 
with the text portion from which the response is 
extracted, it is then necessary to identify the in-
ference: 
 
 This example shows that (1) in the question 
and in the answer, annotations are used to iden-
tify the different components, arguments, ad-
juncts, but also some other components (e.g. 
temporal adverbs), and (2) the annotation is de-
veloped to characterize the matching steps and 
inferential components (either lexical or domain 
knowledge) between the question and the an-
swer. This latter form of annotation, which is 
quite time-consuming to develop, is the means 
we use to induce and develop domain dependent 
forms of lexical inference (or other phenomena 
like synonymy, lexical equivalence, etc.) and 
relevant domain knowledge. The types and lexi-
cal functions which are introduced are then used 
in the process of induction of generalizations 
over some semantic categories (plants, products, 
etc.), and verb classes. This way of annotating 
knowledge and inferences is obviously a simple 
bottom-up process, with well known limitations, 
but we feel it may have some advantages for in-
ducing an upper organization of knowledge, in 
conjunction, and as a complement to, the domain 
ontology. It is also simple and accessible to an-
notators. Obviously this remains to be evaluated.  
4.4  Generalizing inferences for question-
answer matching 
At this level, the inferences which may be drawn 
are directly attached to the terms which are 
tagged. This is obviously too limited. We are 
now experimenting with different generalization 
strategies in order to tune the lexical inference 
rules. This process involves: 
(1) developing various generic principles over 
different types and categories (via the domain 
ontology), We will annotation the title for match-
ing the ?theme? of the answer to the ?theme? and 
?Focus? of the question by using word net and 
ontology as shown below.  
Surface Form Concept 
destroy, destruct, eliminate, kill,? destroy 
treat, prevent, eradicate, protect,? manage 
suck, eat, bite, drink,? consume 
spread out, diffuse, disperse,? spread 
(2) a set of principles that limit these generali-
zations via, for example, the taking into account 
of the semantics restrictions imposed by lexical 
items, in particular verbs. The main words of the 
question focus and text body that already anno-
tated will be considered for extracting the poten-
tial candidates containing the response. The sen-
tences, where the terms of the question or de-
rived terms (closely related terms) are effectively 
found, will be the corresponding answer by using 
matching function as shown below. 
 
Function Matching (Question Q, Answer A){ 
      Match = false; 
     // Relevant document 
     If  (Q.focus  =  A.index)  then 
             // Relevant answer 
             If  (Q.type =  A.task type) then      
                    //Detect Answer for the Question 
                    If (Q.focus = A.title) then 
                         Match = true; 
                    Else if (Q.action = A.action and 
                               Q.theme = A.theme or 
                               Q.agent = A.agent) then 
                         Match = true; 
                    End If 
             End If 
       End If 
Return Match;} 
The tuning of the level of these generalizations 
is obviously one main parameter of our project. 
It has several conceptual dimensions that we ex-
plore and may also be domain dependent. 
<lex_inference>  <action> Suck sap of X 
</action>  <entail>  <modality> probably  
</modality>  <action> destroy X </action>  
</entail> ,  <type> X : plant </type>   
<part-of> sap : X </part-of >  </lex inference>  
<response>  <agent> The rice thrips</agent> 
<action>  sucks the sap <source>  from the young
plant. </source> </action> </response> 
<question type=?SqE? focus = ?destroy?>How 
can <agent> thrips </agent> <action>destroy 
<theme>the rice</theme> </action>?</question>
?<action> treat <theme> this disease </theme>   
is the use of <instrument> noninfested seeds 
</instrument> </action> .

Perspectives 
The matching problem between questions and 
documents to retrieve answers in question-
answering systems in concrete applicative con-
texts is often a difficult problem. This matching 
procedure often requires very accurate domain 
knowledge, besides ontological descriptions. It is 
not always easy to access this knowledge in a 
structured way or to extract it from texts. The 
present contribution, still experimental and in an 
early stage of development, is an attempt, via 
annotations, at resolving this problem, following 
a simple and clear methodology. 
This task needs to be developed and evaluated 
gradually. So far, it is too early to evaluate the 
quality of the generalizations and the inferential 
patterns we get.  
This approach, and the principles we have 
briefly outlined, allow us to introduce a working 
method for the development of question-
answering systems for concrete applications, es-
pecially for non-factoid questions, an area which 
is still not very much developed in spite of its 
obvious usefulness. One of the reasons is that 
non-factoid questions require a language proc-
essing technology, analysis methods, reasoning 
aspects, and a conceptual approach, which are 
substantially different from what is used for fac-
toid questions.
