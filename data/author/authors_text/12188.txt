Abstract
In this short paper, we present annotations
for tagging grammatical and stylistic er-
rors, together with attributes about the na-
ture of the correction which are then in-
terpreted as arguments. A decision model
is introduced in order for the author to be
able to decide on the best correction to
make. This introduces an operational se-
mantics for tags and related attributes.
1 Aims and Situation
Non-native English speaking authors producing
documents in English often encounter lexical,
grammatical and stylistic difficulties that make
their texts difficult for native speakers to under-
stand. As a result, the professionalism and the
credibility of these texts is often affected. Our
main aim is to develop procedures for the correc-
tion of those errors which cannot (and will not in
the near future) be treated by the most advanced
text processing systems such as those proposed in
the Office Suite, OpenOffice and the like. In the
type of errors taken into consideration, several lev-
els are often intertwinned: morphology, lexicon,
grammar, style, textual structure, domain usages,
context of production, target audience, etc..
While we attempt to correct errors, it turns out
that, in a large number of cases, (1) there may
be ambiguities in the analysis of the nature of er-
rors, (2) errors can receive various types and lev-
els of corrections depending on the type of docu-
ment, reader, etc., and (3) some corrections can-
not be successfully done without an interaction
with the author. To achieve these aims we need
to produce a model of the cognitive strategies de-
ployed by human experts (e.g. translators cor-
recting texts, teachers) when they detect and cor-
rect errors. Our observations show that it is not
a simple and straightforward strategy, but that er-
ror diagnosis and corrections are often based on a
complex analytical and decisional process. Since
we want our system to have a didactic capacity,
in order to help writers understand their errors,
we propose an analysis of error diagnosis based
on argumentation theory, outlining arguments for
or against a certain correction and their relative
strength paired with a decision theory.
The modelling of correction strategies is based
on the annotation of a large variety of types of doc-
uments in English produced by a large diversity of
French speakers. Annotations allow us to iden-
tify and categorize errors as well as the parame-
ters at stake (e.g. category change, length of new
corrected segment) at stake when making correc-
tions. This is carried out by bilingual correctors
in collaboration with didacticians. Those parame-
ters are a priori neutral in the annotation schemas.
We then define a preference model that assigns po-
larity (positive, negative) and a weight to each of
these parameters, together with additional param-
eters among which the target reader, the type of
document, etc. An argumentation model that con-
siders these parameters as weighted arguments, for
or against a certain correction, can thus be intro-
duced. Paired with a decision model, optimal cor-
rections can be proposed to the author, together
with explanations. This approach confers a formal
interpretation to our annotation schema.
Works on the correction of grammatical errors
made by human authors (Brockett, 2006), (Han et
al. 2005), (Lee et al 2006), (Tetreau et al2008),
(Writer?s v. 8.2) recently started to appear. The ap-
proach presented here, which is still preliminary,
is an attempt to include some didactic aspects into
the correction by explaining to the user the nature
of her/his errors, whether grammatical or stylis-
tic, while weighing the pros and cons of a cor-
rection, via argumentation and decision theories
(Boutiler et al. 1999), (Amgoud et al. 2008).
Persuasion aspects also matter within the didacti-
cal perspective (e.g. Persuation Technology sym-
130
posiums), (Prakken 2006).
In this document, we present the premisses of
an approach to correcting complex grammar and
style errors, which allow us to evaluate difficulties,
challenges, deadlocks, etc. Annotations are used
here for the development of an application.
2 The annotated corpus
The documents analyzed range from spontaneous
short productions, with little control and proof-
reading, such as personal emails or posts on fo-
rums, to highly controlled documents such as pub-
lications or professional reports. We also consider
personal web pages and wiki texts. Within each
of these types, we also observed variation in the
control of the quality of the writing. For exam-
ple, emails sent to friends are less controlled than
those produced in a professional environment, and
even in this latter framework, messages sent to the
hierarchy or to foreign colleagues receive more at-
tention than those sent to close colleagues. Be-
sides the level of control, other parameters, such
as style, are taken into consideration (e.g. oral
vs. academic). Therefore, the different corpora we
have collected form a certain continuum over sev-
eral parameters (control, orality, etc.); they allow
us to observe a large variety of language produc-
tions.
More details on the elaboration of corpora, def-
inition of attributes and their stability, and annota-
tion scenarios can be found in (Albert et al, 2009).
3 The Annotation System
Let us now briefly introduce the annotation
schema we have developed. It is an ongoing ef-
fort which is gradually evaluated by real users.
This schema is an attempt to reflect, in a fac-
tual and declarative way, the different parameters
taken into consideration by didacticians and hu-
man translators when detecting and correcting er-
rors. It contains several groups of tags which are
given below. The values for each attribute are
based on a granularity level evaluated by the di-
dacticians of our group. They are still preliminary
and require evaluation and revisions. Their struc-
ture has been designed so that they can be used in
an argumentation framework.
(a) Error delimitation and characterization:
<error-zone> tags the group of words involved in
the error. The zone is meant to be as minimal as
possible. This tag has several attributes:
comprehension: from 0 to 4 (0 being worse): indi-
cates if the segment is understandable, in spite of
the error,
agrammaticality: from 0 to 2: indicates how un-
grammtical the error is.
categ: main category of the error: lexical, syntac-
tic, stylistic, semantic, textual,
source: calque (direct copy), overcorrection, etc.
(b) Delimitation of the correction:
<correction-zone> tags the text fragment in-
volved in the correction. It is equal or larger than
the error zone.
(c) Characterization of a given correction:
Each correction is characterized by a tag
<correction> and associated attributes, positively
oriented ones are underlined:
surface: size of the text segment affected by the
correction: minimal, average, maximal,
grammar: indicates, whenever appropriate, if the
correction proposed is the standard one as sug-
gested by grammar rules; values are: by-default,
alternative, unlikely,
meaning: indicates if the meaning has been al-
tered: yes, somewhat, no,
var-size: is an integer that indicates the
increase/decrease in number of words of the cor-
rection w.r.t. the original fragment,
change: indicates if the changes in the correction
are syntactic, lexical, stylistic, semantic or textual,
comp: indicates if the proposed correction is a text
fragment which is easy to understand or not; val-
ues are: yes, average, no,
fix: indicates, when mentioned, that the error is
very specific to that string of words and that the
correction is idiosyncratic and cannot be extended
to any other such structure.
qualif: indicates the certainty level of the annota-
tor and didacticians, it qualifies the certainty of the
error detection and of the proposed correction se-
paretely,
correct: gives the correction.
An example is the N N construction (for the
sake of readability, we do not consider longer N
chains), with erroneous segments like: the mean-
ing utterance or goal failure:
It is difficult to characterize <correction-zone>
<error-zone comprehension=?2?
agrammaticality=?1?
categ=?syntax? source=?calque?>
the meaning utterance
<correction qualif=?high? grammar=?by-default?
131
surface= ?minimal? meaning= ?not altered? Var-size=?+2?
change=?synt? comp=?yes?
correct= ?the meaning of the utterance?>
</correction>
<correction qualif=?high? grammar=?unlikely?
surface= ?minimal? meaning= ?somewhat? Var-size=?0?
change=?lexical+synt? comp=?average?
correct= ?the meaningful utterance?>
</correction>
</error-zone> </correction-zone> without a context.
These tags are relatively simple and intuitive.
After some basic training, 2 independent annota-
tors covered about 25 pages (emails and reports)
so that we can measure the stability of the annota-
tions and the annotators comprehension and agree-
ment/disagreement. Results are not easy to ana-
lyze in a simple way since annotators disagree on
some error existence and nature. In about 20% of
the cases we observed such forms of disagreement.
Beside this observation, annotations turn out to be
quite convenient, although, for each error, a con-
siderable analysis effort is required for its analysis.
Annotating texts is very much time consuming, in
particular when there are several possibilities of
corrections.
4 From annotations to correction rules
Our corpus (texts, emails) has been annotated fol-
lowing the above schema. Several steps are re-
quired in order to reach the correction rule stage of
drafting rules of corrections. The approach is still
exploratory, and needs further elaborations and
evaluations. This is achieved through a gradual
and manually controlled machine learning strat-
egy. As a result, we get 23 main categories of
errors based on the elements involved in the gram-
matical and stylistic aspects, e.g.: incorrect argu-
ment structure, incorrect adverb position, incor-
rect embedded clause construction, incorrect co-
ordination, incorrect paragraph start.
To define a correction rule, the segment of
words in the error zone first gets a morphosyn-
tactic tagging, so that it can be easily identified
as an erroneous pattern in any circumstance. All
the errors that have the same erroneous pattern are
grouped to form a single correction procedure. In
that same category (named ?incorrect N N con-
structions?), another pattern is [N(+plural) N] (e.g.
horses carriage), and it results in a different cor-
rection rule.
Concerning the pattern ?Det N N?, when all the
corresponding errors are grouped, another type of
correction is found that corresponds to the inver-
sion (the predicate meaning ? the meaning of the
predicate). Informally, a correction rule is defined
as the union of all the corrections found for that
particular pattern:
(1) merge all corrections which are similar, i.e.
where the position of each word in the erroneous
segment is identical to the one it has in the cor-
rection; the values of the different attributes of the
<correction> tag are averaged,
(2) append all corrections which have a different
correction following the word to word criterion
above, and also all corrections for which the at-
tribute ?fix? is true.
(3) tag the corrections with all the appropriate
morphosyntactic details,
(4) remove the text segments or keep them as ex-
amples.
For the above example, we get the following
rule:
<correction-rule>
<error-zone comprehension=?2? agrammaticality=?1?
categ=?syntax? source=?calque?
pattern=?[Det N(1) N(2)?]>
<correction qualif=?high? grammar=?by-default?
surface= ?minimal? meaning= ?not altered? Var-size=?+2?
change=?synt? comp=?yes?
web-correct= ?[Det N(1) of the N(2)]? >
</correction>
<correction qualif=?high? grammar=?unlikely?
surface= ?minimal?
meaning= ?somewhat? Var-size=?0?
change=?lexical+synt? comp=?average?
correct=?[Det Adj(deriv(N(1)) N(2)]?
exemple=?the meaningful utterance?>
</correction>
<correction qualif=?high? grammar=?by-default?
surface= ?minimal?
meaning= ?not altered? Var-size=?+2?
change=?synt? comp=?yes?
web-correct= ?[Det N(2) of the N(1)]? >
</correction> </error-zone> </correction-rule>
We observe here several competing solutions:
when we have a segment like the meaning pred-
icate we have no information as to the noun or-
der and the type of preposition to insert (however,
?of? is the most frequent one). In this example,
the best solution is to use the web as a corpus.
The attribute web-correct is a shortcut for a func-
tion that triggers a web search: the instanciated
132
pattern is submitted to a search engine to evaluate
its occurence frequency. The most frequent one is
adopted. Other rules contain e.g. interactions with
the user to get a missing argument or to correct a
pronoun.
The form: pattern ? correct (or) web-correct
is a rewriting rule that operates the correction un-
der constraints given in the ?correct? attribute and
under didactic constraints given in the associated
attributes. Several corrections from the same rule
or from different rules may be competing. This
is a very frequent situation, e.g.: the position of
the adverb which may equally be either before the
main verb, or at the beginning, or at the end of the
sentence. A correction rule is active for a given
correction iff all the constraints it contains in the
?correct? attribute are met.
5 Using argumentation to structure the
correction space
Our goal, within an ?active didactics? perspective,
consists in identifying the best corrections and
proposing them to the writer together with expla-
nations, so that he can make the most relevant de-
cisions. Classical decision theory must be paired
with argumentation to produce explanations. In
our framework, argumentation is based on the at-
tributes associated with the tags of the correction
rules. This view confers a kind of operational se-
mantics to the tags and attributes we have defined.
Formally, a decision based on practical argu-
ments is represented by a vector (D, K, G, R) de-
fined as follows:
(1) D is a vector composed of decision variables
associated with explanations: the list of the differ-
ent decisions which can be taken into considera-
tion, including no correction. The final decision is
then made by the writer,
(2) K is a structure of stratified knowledge, pos-
sibly inconsistent. Stratifications encode priori-
ties (e.g. Bratman, 1987, Amgoud et al 2008).
K includes, for example, knowledge about read-
ers (e.g. in emails they like short messages, close
to oral communication), grammatical and stylistic
conventions or by-default behaviors, global con-
straints on texts or sentences. Each strata is asso-
ciated with a weight wK ? [0, 1]
(3) G is a set of goals, possibly inconsistent, that
correspond to positive attributes Ai to promote in
a correction. These goals depend on the type of
document being written. For example, for emails,
we may have the following goals: (meaning: no,
comp: yes, grammar: by-default). These goals
may have different weights. The form of a goal
is:
(attribute? name, value,weight)
where weight is: wAi ? [0, 1].
(4) R is a set of rejections: i.e. criteria that are not
desired, e.g., for emails: (surface: not(minimal),
change: style, semantic, textual). Format is the
same as for G. R and G have an empty intersec-
tion. These rejections may also have weights.
Some attributes may remain neutral (e.g. var-size)
for a given type of document or profile.
The global scenario for correcting an error
is as follows: while checking a text, when an
error pattern (or more if patterns are ambigu-
ous) is activated, the corrections proposed in the
<correction> tag are activated and a number of
them become active because the corresponding
?correct? attribute is active. Then, the attributes in
each of the correction, which form arguments, are
integrated in the decision process. Their weight in
G or R is integrated in a decision formula; these
weights may be reinforced or weakened via the
knowledge and preferences given in K. For each
correction decision, a meta-argument that contains
all the weighted pros and cons is produced. This
meta-argument is the motivation and explanation
for realizing the correction as suggested. It has no
polarity.
