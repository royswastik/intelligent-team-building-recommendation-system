Abstract 
Setswana, a Bantu language in the Sotho 
group, is one of the eleven official languages 
of South Africa.  The language is character-
ised by a disjunctive orthography, mainly af-
fecting the important word category of verbs. 
In particular, verbal prefixal morphemes are 
usually written disjunctively, while suffixal 
morphemes follow a conjunctive writing 
style. Therefore, Setswana tokenisation can-
not be based solely on whitespace, as is the 
case in many alphabetic, segmented lan-
guages, including the conjunctively written 
Nguni group of South African Bantu lan-
guages. This paper shows how a combination 
of two tokeniser transducers and a finite-state 
(rule-based) morphological analyser may be 
combined to effectively solve the Setswana 
tokenisation problem. The approach has the 
important advantage of bringing the process-
ing of Setswana beyond the morphological 
analysis level in line with what is appropriate 
for the Nguni languages. This means that the 
challenge of the disjunctive orthography is 
met at the tokenisation/morphological analy-
sis level and does not in principle propagate 
to subsequent levels of analysis such as POS 
tagging and shallow parsing, etc. Indeed, the 
approach ensures that an aspect such as or-
thography does not obfuscate sound linguis-
tics and, ultimately, proper semantic analysis, 
which remains the ultimate aim of linguistic 
analysis and therefore also computational lin-
guistic analysis. 
1 Introduction 
Words, syntactic groups, clauses, sentences, 
paragraphs, etc. usually form the basis of the 
analysis and processing of natural language text. 
However, texts in electronic form are just se-
quences of characters, including letters of the 
alphabet, numbers, punctuation, special symbols, 
whitespace, etc. The identification of word and 
sentence boundaries is therefore essential for any 
further processing of an electronic text. Tokeni-
sation or word segmentation may be defined as 
the process of breaking up the sequence of char-
acters in a text at the word boundaries (see, for 
example, Palmer, 2000). Tokenisation may there-
fore be regarded as a core technology in natural 
language processing. 
Since disjunctive orthography is our focus, we 
distinguish between an orthographic word, that is 
a unit of text bounded by whitespace, but not 
containing whitespace, and a linguistic word, that 
is a sequence of orthographic words that together 
functions as a member of a word category such 
as, for example, nouns, pronouns, verbs and ad-
verbs (Kosch, 2006).  Therefore, tokenisation 
may also be described as the process of identify-
ing linguistic words, henceforth referred to as 
tokens. 
While the Bantu languages are all agglutina-
tive and exhibit significant inherent structural 
similarity, they differ substantially in terms of 
their orthography. The reasons for this difference 
are both historical and phonological. A detailed 
66
discussion of this aspect falls outside the scope 
of this article, but the interested reader is referred 
to Cole (1955), Van Wyk (1958 & 1967) and 
Kr?ger (2006).  
Setswana, Northern Sotho and Southern Sotho 
form the Sotho group belonging to the South-
Eastern zone of Bantu languages. These lan-
guages are characterised by a disjunctive (also 
referred to as semi-conjunctive) orthography, 
affecting mainly the word category of verbs 
(Kr?ger, 2006:12-28). In particular, verbal pre-
fixal morphemes are usually written disjunc-
tively, while suffixal morphemes follow a con-
junctive writing style. For this reason Setswana 
tokenisation cannot be based solely on 
whitespace, as is the case in many alphabetic, 
segmented languages, including the conjunc-
tively written Nguni group of South African 
Bantu languages, which includes Zulu, Xhosa, 
Swati and Ndebele.  
The following research question arises: Can 
the development and application of a precise to-
keniser and morphological analyser for Setswana 
resolve the issue of disjunctive orthography? If 
so, subsequent levels of processing could exploit 
the inherent structural similarities between the 
Bantu languages (Dixon and Aikhenvald, 
2002:8) and allow a uniform approach. 
The structure of the paper is as follows: The 
introduction states and contextualises the re-
search question. The following section discusses 
tokenisation in the context of the South African 
Bantu languages. Since the morphological struc-
ture of the Setswana verb is central to the tokeni-
sation problem, the next section comprises a 
brief exposition thereof. The paper then proceeds 
to discuss the finite-state computational approach 
that is followed. This entails the combination of 
two tokeniser transducers and a finite-state (rule-
based) morphological analyser.  The penultimate 
section concerns a discussion of the computa-
tional results and insights gained.  Possibilities 
for future work conclude the paper. 
2 Tokenisation 
Tokenisation for alphabetic, segmented lan-
guages such as English is considered a relatively 
simple process where linguistic words are usu-
ally delimited by whitespace and punctuation. 
This task is effectively handled by means of 
regular expression scripts. Mikeev (2003) how-
ever warns that ?errors made at such an early 
stage are very likely to induce more errors at 
later stages of text processing and are therefore 
very dangerous.? The importance of accurate 
tokenisation is also emphasised by Forst and 
Kaplan (2006). While Setswana is also an alpha-
betic segmented language, its disjunctive orthog-
raphy causes token internal whitespace in a 
number of constructions of which the verb is the 
most important and widely occurring. Since the 
standard tokenisation issues of languages such as 
English have been extensively discussed (Far-
ghaly, 2003; Mikeev, 2003; Palmer, 2000), our 
focus is on the challenge of Setswana verb to-
kenisation specifically. We illustrate this by 
means of two examples: 
Example 1: In the English sentence ?I shall buy 
meat? the four tokens (separated by ?/?) are I / 
shall / buy / meat.  However, in the Setswana 
sentence Ke tla reka nama (I shall buy meat) the 
two tokens are Ke tla reka / nama.   
Example 2: Improper tokenisation may distort 
corpus linguistic conclusions and statistics. In a 
study on corpus design for Setswana lexicogra-
phy Otlogetswe (2007) claims that a is the most 
frequent ?word? in his 1.3 million ?words? 
Setswana corpus (Otlogetswe, 2007:125). In re-
ality, the orthographic word a in Setswana could 
be any of several linguistic words or morphemes.  
Compare the following:  
A/ o itse/ rre/ yo/?  (Do you know this gentle-
man?)  Interrogative particle; 
Re bone/ makau/ a/ maabane/.  (We saw these 
young men yesterday.)  Demonstrative pronoun; 
Metsi/ a/ bollo/.  (The water is hot.)  Descriptive 
copulative; 
Madi/ a/ rona/ a/ mo/ bankeng/.  (Our money 
(the money of us) is in the bank.)  Possessive 
particle and descriptive copulative; 
Mosadi/ a ba bitsa/.  (The woman (then) called 
them.)  Subject agreement morpheme; 
Dintswa/ ga di a re bona/.  (The dogs did not see 
us.)  Negative morpheme, which is concomitant 
with the negative morpheme ga when the nega-
tive of the perfect is indicated, thus an example 
of a separated dependency.  
In the six occurrences of a above only four 
represent orthographic words that should form 
part of a word frequency count for a.  
The above examples emphasise the impor-
tance of correct tokenisation of corpora, particu-
larly in the light of the increased exploitation of 
electronic corpora for linguistic and lexico-
graphic research. In particular, the correct to-
kenisation of verbs in disjunctively written lan-
guages is crucial for all reliable and accurate 
corpus-based research. Hurskeinen et al 
(2005:450) confirm this by stating that ?a care-
67
fully designed tokeniser is a prerequisite for 
identifying verb structure in text?.   
3 Morphological Structure of the Verb 
in Setswana 
A complete exposition of Setswana verb mor-
phology falls outside the scope of this article (see 
Kr?ger, 2006). Main aspects of interest are 
briefly introduced and illustrated by means of 
examples.  
The most basic form of the verb in Setswana 
consists of an infinitive prefix + a root + a verb-
final suffix, for example, go bona (to see) con-
sists of the infinitive prefix go, the root bon- and 
the verb-final suffix -a.   
While verbs in Setswana may also include 
various other prefixes and suffixes, the root al-
ways forms the lexical core of a word. Kr?ger 
(2006:36) describes the root as ?a lexical mor-
pheme [that] can be defined as that part of a 
word which does not include a grammatical 
morpheme; cannot occur independently as in the 
case with words; constitutes the lexical meaning 
of a word and belongs quantitatively to an open 
class?. 
3.1 Prefixes of the Setswana verb 
The verbal root can be preceded by several pre-
fixes (cf. Kr?ger (2006:171-183): 
Subject agreement morphemes: The subject 
agreement morphemes, written disjunctively, 
include non-consecutive subject agreement mor-
phemes and consecutive subject agreement mor-
phemes.  This is the only modal distinction that 
influences the form of the subject morpheme. 
The same subject agreement morpheme therefore 
has a consecutive as well as a non-consecutive 
form. For example, the non-consecutive subject 
agreement morpheme for class 5 is le as in lekau 
le a tshega (the young man is laughing), while 
the consecutive subject agreement morpheme for 
class 5 is la as in lekau la tshega (the young man 
then laughed). 
Object agreement morphemes: The object 
agreement morpheme is written disjunctively in 
most instances, for example ba di bona (they see 
it).  
The reflexive morpheme: The reflexive mor-
pheme i- (-self) is always written conjunctively 
to the root, for example o ipona (he sees him-
self).  
The aspectual morphemes: The aspectual 
morphemes are written disjunctively and include 
the present tense morpheme a, the progressive 
morpheme sa (still) and the potential morpheme 
ka (can). Examples are o a araba (he answers), 
ba sa ithuta (they are still learning) and ba ka 
ithuta (they can learn). 
The temporal morpheme: The temporal 
morpheme tla (indicating the future tense) is 
written disjunctively, for example ba tla ithuta 
(they shall learn). 
The negative morphemes ga, sa and se: The 
negative morphemes ga, sa and se are written 
disjunctively.  Examples are ga ba ithute (they 
do not learn), re sa mo thuse (we do not help 
him), o se mo rome (do not send him). 
3.2 Suffixes of the Setswana verb 
Various morphemes may be suffixed to the 
verbal root and follow the conjunctive writing 
style: 
Verb-final morphemes: Verbal-final suffixes 
a, e, the relative -ng and the imperative ?ng, for 
example, ga ba ithute (they are not learning). 
The causative suffix -is-: Example, o rekisa 
(he sells (he causes to buy)). 
The applicative suffix -el-: Example, o balela 
(she reads for). 
The reciprocal suffix -an-: Example, re a 
thusana (we help each other). 
The perfect suffix -il-: Example, ba utlwile 
(they heard). 
The passive suffix -w-: Example, o romiwa 
(he is sent). 
3.3 Auxiliary verbs and copulatives  
Kr?ger (2006:273) states that ?Syntactically an 
auxiliary verb is a verb which must be followed 
by a complementary predicate, which can be a 
verb or verbal group or a copulative group or an 
auxiliary verbal group, because it cannot func-
tion in isolation?.  Consider the following exam-
ple of the auxiliary verb tlhola:  re tlhola/ re ba 
thusa/ (we always help them).  For a more de-
tailed discussion of auxiliary verbs in Setswana 
refer to Pretorius (1997). 
Copulatives function as introductory members 
to non-verbal complements.  The morphological 
forms of copula are determined by the copulative 
relation and the type of modal category in which 
they occur.  These factors give rise to a large va-
riety of morphological forms (Kr?ger, 2006: 
275-281). 
3.4 Formation of verbs 
The formation of Setswana verbs is governed by 
a set of linguistic rules according to which the 
various prefixes and suffixes may be sequenced 
68
to form valid verb forms (so-called morhotactics) 
and by a set of morphophonological alternation 
rules that model the sound changes that occur at 
morpheme boundaries. These formation rules 
constitute a model of Setswana morphology that 
forms the basis of the finite-state morphological 
analyser, discussed in subsequent sections.  
This model, supported by a complete set of 
known, attested Setswana roots, may be used to 
recognise valid words, including verbs. It will 
not recognise either incorrectly formed or partial 
strings as words. The significance of this for to-
kenisation specifically is that, in principle, the 
model and therefore also the morphological ana-
lyser based on it can and should recognise only 
(valid) tokens. 
Morphotactics: While verbs may be analysed 
linearly or hierarchically, our computational 
analysis follows the former approach, for exam-
ple: 
ba a kwala (they write) 
Verb(INDmode),(PREStense,Pos):AgrSubj-
Cl2+AspPre + [kwal]+Term 
o tla reka (he will buy) 
Verb(INDmode),(FUTtense,Pos):AgrSubj-
Cl1+TmpPre+[rek]+Term 
ke dirile (I have worked) 
Verb(INDmode),(PERFtense,Pos):AgrSubj-
1P-Sg+[dir]+Perf+Term 
The above analyses indicate the part-of-speech 
(verb), the mode ( indicative) and the tense (pre-
sent, future or perfect), followed by a ?:? and then 
the morphological analyses. The tags are chosen 
to be self-explanatory and the verb root appears 
in square brackets.  For example the first analysis 
is ba: subject agreement class 2; a: aspectual 
prefix; kwal: verb root; a: verb terminative (verb-
final suffix). The notation used in the presenta-
tion of the morphological analyses is user-
defined. 
In linear analyses the prefixes and suffixes 
have a specific sequencing with regard to the 
verbal root. We illustrate this by means of a 
number of examples. A detailed exposition of the 
rules governing the order and valid combinations 
of the various prefixes and suffixes may be found 
in Kr?ger (2006). 
Object agreement morphemes and the reflex-
ive morpheme always appear directly in front of 
the verbal root, for example le a di reka (he buys 
it). No other prefix can be placed between the 
object agreement morpheme and the verbal root 
or between the reflexive morpheme and the ver-
bal root. 
The position of the negative morpheme ga is 
always directly in front of the subject agreement 
morpheme, for example, ga ke di b?ne. (I do not 
see it/them). 
The negative morpheme sa follows the subject 
agreement morpheme, for example, (fa) le sa 
dire ((while) he is not working). 
The negative morpheme se also follows the 
subject agreement morpheme, for example, 
(gore) re se di je ((so that) we do not eat it).  
However, if the verb is in the imperative mood 
the negative morpheme se is used before the ver-
bal root, for example, Se kwale! (Do not write!). 
The aspectual morphemes always follow the 
subject agreement morpheme, for example, ba sa 
dira (they are still working). 
The temporal morpheme also follows the sub-
ject agreement morpheme, for example, ba tla 
dira (they shall work). 
Due to the agglutinating nature of the lan-
guage and the presence of long distance depend-
encies, the combinatorial complexity of possible 
morpheme combinations makes the identification 
of the underlying verb rather difficult. Examples 
of rules that assist in limiting possible combina-
tions are as follows: 
The object agreement morpheme is a prefix 
that can be used simultaneously with the other 
prefixes in the verb, for example, ba a di bona 
(they see it/them). 
The aspectual morphemes and the temporal 
morpheme cannot be used simultaneously, for 
example, le ka ithuta (he can learn) and le tla 
ithuta (he will learn). 
Since (combinations of) suffixes are written 
conjunctively, they do not add to the complexity 
of the disjunctive writing style prevalent in verb 
tokenisation. 
Morphophonological alternation rules: 
Sound changes can occur when morphemes are 
affixed to the verbal root. 
The prefixes: The object agreement mor-
pheme of the first person singular ni/n in combi-
nation with the root causes a sound change and 
this combination is written conjunctively, for 
example ba ni-bon-a > ba mpona (they see me).  
In some instances the object agreement mor-
pheme of the third person singular and class 1 
causes sound changes when used with verbal 
roots beginning with b-.  They are then written 
conjunctively, for example, ba mo-bon-a > ba 
mmona (they see him). 
When the subject agreement morpheme ke 
(the first person singular) and the progressive 
morpheme ka are used in the same verb, the 
sound change ke ka > nka appears, for example, 
ke ka opela > nka opela (I can sing). 
69
The suffixes: Sound changes also occur under 
certain circumstances, but do not affect the con-
junctive writing style.  
Summarising, the processing of electronic 
Setswana text requires precise tokenisation; the 
disjunctive writing style followed for verb con-
structions renders tokenisation on whitespace 
inappropriate; morphological structure is crucial 
in identifying valid verbs in text;  due to the 
regularity of word formation, linguistic rules 
(morphotactics and morphophonological alterna-
tion rules) suggest a rule-based model of 
Setswana morphology that may form the basis of 
a tokeniser transducer, and together with an ex-
tensive word root lexicon, also the basis for a 
rule-based morphological analyser. Since the 
Bantu languages exhibit similar linguistic struc-
ture, differences in orthography should be ad-
dressed at tokenisation / morphological analysis 
level so that subsequent levels of computational 
(syntactic and semantic) analysis may benefit 
optimally from prevalent structural similarities. 
4 Facing the Computational Challenge 
Apart from tokenisation, computational morpho-
logical analysis is regarded as central to the 
processing of the (agglutinating) South African 
Bantu languages (Bosch & Pretorius, 2002, Pre-
torius & Bosch, 2003). Moreover, standards and 
standardisation are pertinent to the development 
of appropriate software tools and language re-
sources (Van Rooy & Pretorius, 2003), particu-
larly for languages that are similar in structure.  
While such standardisation is an ideal worth 
striving for, it remains difficult to attain. Indeed, 
the non-standard writing styles pose a definite 
challenge.  
4.1 Other approaches to Bantu tokenisation 
Taljard and Bosch (2005) advocate an ap-
proach to word class identification that makes no 
mention of tokenisation as a central issue in the 
processing of Northern Sotho and Zulu text. For 
Northern Sotho they propose a hybrid system 
(consisting of a tagger, a morphological analyser 
and a grammar) ?containing information on both 
morphological and syntactic aspects, although 
biased towards morphology. This approach is 
dictated at least in part, by the disjunctive 
method of writing.? In contrast, Hurskainen et al 
(2005) in their work on the computational de-
scription of verbs of Kwanjama and Northern 
Sotho, concludes that ?a carefully designed to-
keniser is a prerequisite for identifying verb 
structures in text?. Anderson and Kotz? (2006) 
concur that in their development of a Northern 
Sotho morphological analyser ?it became obvi-
ous that tokenisation was a problem that needed 
to be overcome for the Northern Sotho language 
as distinct from the ongoing morphological and 
morpho-phonological analysis?.  
4.2 Our approach 
Our underlying assumption is that the Bantu lan-
guages are structurally very closely related. Our 
contention is that precise tokenisation will result 
in comparable morphological analyses, and that 
the similarities and structural agreement between 
Setswana and languages such as Zulu will pre-
vail at subsequent levels of syntactic analysis, 
which could and should then also be computa-
tionally exploited. 
 Our approach is based on the novel combina-
tion of two tokeniser transducers and a morpho-
logical analyser for Setswana. 
4.3 Morphological analyser 
The finite-state morphological analyser prototype 
for Setswana, developed with the Xerox finite 
state toolkit (Beesley and Karttunen, 2003), im-
plements Setswana morpheme sequencing (mor-
photactics) by means of a lexc script containing 
cascades of so-called lexicons, each of 
which represents a specific type of prefix, suffix 
or root. Sound changes at morpheme boundaries 
(morphophonological alternation rules) are im-
plemented by means of xfst regular expressions. 
These lexc and xfst scripts are then compiled and 
subsequently composed into a single finite state 
transducer, constituting the morphological ana-
lyser (Pretorius et al, 2005 and 2008). While the 
implementation of the morphotactics and alterna-
tion rules is, in principle, complete, the word root 
lexicons still need to be extended to include all 
known and valid Setswana roots. The verb mor-
phology is based on the assumption that valid 
verb structures are disjunctively written. For ex-
ample, the verb token re tla dula (we will 
sit/stay) is analysed as follows: 
Verb(INDmode),(FUTtense,Pos): AgrSubj-
1p-Pl+TmpPre+[dul]+Term 
or 
Verb(PARmode),(FUTtense,Pos): AgrSubj-
1p-Pl+TmpPre+[dul]+Term 
Both modes, indicative and participial, consti-
tute valid analyses. The occurrence of multiple 
valid morphological analyses is typical and 
would require (context dependent) disambigua-
tion at subsequent levels of processing.  
70
4.4 Tokeniser 
Since the focus is on verb constructions, the 
Setswana tokeniser prototype makes provision 
for punctuation and alphabetic text, but not yet 
for the usual non-alphabetic tokens such as dates, 
numbers, hyphenation, abbreviations, etc. A 
grammar for linguistically valid verb construc-
tions is implemented with xfst regular expres-
sions. By way of illustration we show a fragment 
thereof, where SP represents a single blank char-
acter, WS is general whitespace and SYMBOL is 
punctuation. In the fragment of xfst below ?...? 
indicates that other options have been removed 
for conciseness and is not strict xfst syntax : 
define WORD [Char]+[SP | SYMBOL]; 
define WORDwithVERBEnding [Char]+[a | e 
| n g] [SP | SYMBOL]; 
echo >>> define object concords 
define OBJ [g o | r e | l o | l e | m o 
| b a | o | e | a | s e | d i | b o] 
WS+; 
echo >>> define subject concords 
define SUBJ [k e | o | r e | l o | l e | 
a | b a | e | s e | d i | b o | g o] 
WS+; 
echo >>> define verb prefixes 
echo >>> define indicative mode 
define INDPREF [(g a WS+) SUBJ ([a | s a 
] WS+) ([a | k a | s a] WS+) (t l a WS+) 
(OBJ)]; 
define VPREF [...| INDPREF | ...]; 
echo >>> define verb groups 
define VGROUP [VPREF WORDwithVERBEnd-
ing]; 
echo >>> define tokens 
define Token [VGROUP | WORD | ...]; 
 
Finally, whitespace is normalised to a single 
blank character and the right-arrow, right-to-left, 
longest match rule for verb tokens is built on the 
template  
A ->@ B || L _ R; 
where A, B, L and R are regular expressions de-
noting languages, and L and R are optional 
(Beesley and Karttunen, 2003:174).  
We note that (i) it may happen that a longest 
match does not constitute a valid verb construct; 
(ii) the right-to-left strategy is appropriate since 
the verb root and suffixes are written conjunc-
tively and therefore should not be individually 
identified at the tokenisation stage while disjunc-
tively written prefixes need to be recognised. 
 The two aspects that need further clarification 
are (i) How do we determine whether a mor-
pheme sequence is valid? (ii) How do we recog-
nise disjunctively written prefixes?   Both these 
questions are discussed in the subsequent sec-
tion. 
4.5 Methodology 
Our methodology is based on a combination of 
a comprehensive and reliable morphological ana-
lyser for Setswana catering for disjunctively 
written verb constructions (see section 5.3), a 
verb tokeniser transducer (see section 5.4) and a 
tokeniser transducer that tokenises on 
whitespace. The process is illustrated in Figure 1. 
Central to our approach is the assumption that 
only analysed tokens are valid tokens and strings 
that could not be analysed are not valid linguistic 
words. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    Analysed strings, typically verbs              Unanalysed strings 
 
 
 
 
   Analysed strings, typically 
       other word categories 
 
                  Unanalysed strings 
 
Figure 1: Tokenisation procedure 
 
Tokenisation procedure: 
Step 1: Normalise test data (running text) by re-
moving capitalisation and punctuation; 
Step 2: Tokenise on longest match right-to-left; 
Step 3: Perform a morphological analysis of the 
?tokens? from step 2; 
Step 4: Separate the tokens that were successfully 
analysed in step 3 from those that could not be ana-
lysed;  
Step 5: Tokenise all unanalysed ?tokens? from step 
4 on whitespace; 
[Example: unanalysed wa me becomes wa and me.] 
Step 6: Perform a morphological analysis of the 
?tokens? in step 5; 
Step 7: Again, as in step 4, separate the analysed 
and unanalysed strings resulting from step 6; 
Step 8: Combine all the valid tokens from steps 4 
and 7. 
This procedure yields the tokens obtained by 
computational means. Errors are typically strings 
that could not be analysed by the morphological 
analyser and should be rare. These strings should 
be subjected to human elicitation. Finally a com-
parison of the correspondences and differences

between the hand-tokenised tokens (hand-tokens) 
and the tokens obtained by computational means 
(auto-tokens) is necessary in order to assess the 
reliability of the described tokenisation approach. 
 
The test data: Since the purpose was to estab-
lish the validity of the tokenisation approach, we 
made use of a short Setswana text of 547 ortho-
graphic words, containing a variety of verb con-
structions (see Table 1). The text was tokenised 
by hand and checked by a linguist in order to 
provide a means to measure the success of the 
tokenisation approach. Furthermore, the text was 
normalised not to contain capitalisation and 
punctuation. All word roots occurring in the text 
were added to the root lexicon of the morpho-
logical analyser to ensure that limitations in the 
analyser would not influence the tokenisation 
experiment. 
Examples of output of step 2:  
ke tla nna 
o tla go kopa 
le ditsebe 
Examples of output of step 3: 
Based on the morphological analysis, the first 
two of the above longest matches are tokens and 
the third is not. The relevant analyses are: 
ke tla nna 
Verb(INDmode), (FUTtense,Pos): AgrSubj-
1p-Sg+TmpPre+[nn]+Term 
o tla go kopa 
Verb(INDmode), (FUTtense,Pos): AgrSubj-

5 Results and Discussion 
The results of the tokenisation procedure ap-
plied to the test data, is summarised in Tables 1 
and 2.

Table 1. Verb constructions 
Table 1 shows that 111 of the 409 tokens in 
the test data consist of more than one ortho-
graphic word (i.e. verb constructions) of which 
95 are correctly tokenised. Moreover, it suggests 
that the tokenisation improves with the length of 
the tokens.

Table 2. Tokenisation results 
 
The F-score of 0.93 in Table 2 may be consid-
ered a promising result, given that it was ob-
tained on the most challenging aspect of 
Setswana tokenisation. The approach scales well 
and may form the basis for a full scale, broad 
coverage tokeniser for Setswana. A limiting fac-
tor is the as yet incomplete root lexicon of the 
morphological analyser. However, this may be 
addressed by making use of a guesser variant of 
the morphological analyser that contains conso-
nant/vowel patterns for phonologically possible 
roots to cater for absent roots.  
It should be noted that the procedure presented 
in this paper yields correctly tokenised and mor-
phologically analysed linguistic words, ready for 
subsequent levels of parsing. 
We identify two issues that warrant future in-
vestigation:  
? Longest matches that allow morphologi-
cal analysis, but do not constitute tokens. 
Examples are ba ba neng, e e siameng and 
o o fetileng. In these instances the tokenis-
er did not recognise the qualificative par-
ticle. The tokenisation should have been 
ba/ ba neng, e/ e siameng and o/ o fetileng.  
? Longest matches that do not allow mor-
phological analysis and are directly split 
up into single orthographic words instead 
of allowing verb constructions of interme-
diate length. An example is e le monna, 
which was finally tokenised as e/ le/ mon-
na instead of e le/ monna. 
Finally, perfect tokenisation is context sensi-
tive. The string ke tsala should have been toke-
nised as ke/ tsala (noun), and not as the verb 
construction ke tsala. In another context it can 
however be a verb with tsal- as the verb root.  
In conclusion, we have successfully demon-
strated that the novel combination of a precise 
tokeniser and morphological analyser for 
72
Setswana could indeed form the basis for resolv-
ing the issue of disjunctive orthography.  
6 Future work 
? The extension of the morphological ana-
lyser to include complete coverage of the 
so-called closed word categories, as well 
as comprehensive noun and verb root lexi-
cons; 
? The refinement of the verb tokeniser to 
cater for a more extensive grammar of 
Setswana verb constructions and more so-
phisticated ways of reducing the length of 
invalid longest right-to-left matches; 
? The application of the procedure to large 
text corpora.
