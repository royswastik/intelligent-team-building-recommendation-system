Abstract?In? this? paper,? we? are? proposing? a? multi??lingual?prototype?that?can?effectively?col??lect,?record?and?document?medical?data?in?a?domain?specific? environment.? ?The?aim?of? this?project? is? to?develop?an? electronic?support? system? that? can?be?used? to? assist?asthma?management? in?an?emergency?de??partment.?
1? Introduction?Speech? technology? has? the? ability? to? generate? re??source?and?time?savings?within?a?hospital?environ??ment.? Recording? and? managing? patient? data? from?non?English?backgrounds?can?be?achieved?success??fully?through?the? implementation?of?a?multilingual?voice?system?and?a?standardised?electronic?medical?decision?support?system?such?as?ACAFE?(ACAFE?2006)? described? in? Section? 5.3.? By? implementing?the?ACAFE?standardized?protocols?together?with?a?voice?system,?we?are?able?to?assist?in?the?first?stage?of? the? clinical?pathway? in? the? treatment? and?man??agement? of?Asthma? (see? illustration?of?Stage?1? in?figure?3).?In? this? demonstration? description,? we? are? pro??posing? a? multi?lingual? voice? system? based? on? a?standardized? patient? management? system? called?ACAFE?that?can?effectively?collect?patient?data?in?electronic?format.??The?combination?of?the?two?sys??tems?would?make?it?easier?to?assist?in?the?recording?and?documentation?of?vast?amounts?of?information?
whilst? overcoming? communication? and? efficiency?barriers.?This?data?can?then?be?aggregated?and?ana??lyzed?after?the?event?to?assist?with?clinical?and?per??formance? measures.? This? makes? effective? use? of?emergency? department? resources? while? providing?the? emergency?staff?with? immediate?access? to? im??portant?patient?information.?
2? Objectives?To?show?how?quality?health?care?can?be?delivered?in? a? complex? multilingual? hospital? environment?with? the?aid?of?an? electronic?decision?support?sys??tem?such?as?ACAFE.?
3? Demo?Description?Our?demo?prototype?integrates?a?voice?recognition?system?together?with?the?ACAFE?system?described?in?more?detail?in?section?5.3.?Our?voice?recognition?prototype? relies? on? data? extracted? from? the? stan??dardized? treatment?protocols? that?have?been?based?on? research? by? ACAFE? (ACAFE? et? al.,? 2006).?These?standardized?protocols?form?the?basis?of?our?system?patient? interaction? to? the? medical? sub??domain?(Starlander?et?al.,?2005).?Since?our? system? is? heavily?driven?by?ACAFE,?we?have?been?able?to?minimize?the?requirement?for?an?open?range?of?questions?that?require?translation.?As? a? result,?we? only? require? the?use? of? the? gram??mar?based? language? model? (GLM)? that? has? been?implemented? using? Nuance?s? speech? recognizer?(Nuance? 2005),? and? not? a? statistical? language?model?(SLM).
The?standardized?protocols?require?no?manipula??tion? or? changes? in? tense? as? the?ACAFE?system? is?essentially? a? decision? support? tool.? The? flexibility?of?the?decision?support?tool?allows?the?clinician?to?make?the?final?decision?and?vary?any?responses?or?inputs.?Hence? the?range?of?questions?our?multilin??gual? system? poses? to? the? patient? is? also? standard??ized?and?limited.?With?the?smaller?set?of?questions?it? is? feasible? for? translation? to? occur? via? direct?ACAFE?to?'target?language'?mappings?(subject?lan??guage?to?many?variations?of?a?target?language).?The? use? of? GLMs? over? SLMs? for? medical?speech? translation? has? been? proven? to? provide?higher? translation? accuracy? (Rayner? et? al.,? 2004,?Rayner?et?al.,?2005).?We?expect?that?by?combining?the? higher? accuracy? levels? of? recognition? through?the? use? of? GLMs? with? a? limited? set? of? possible?questions?for?a?particular?medical?sub?domain,?we?can?achieve?an?improved?translation?success?rate.?Currently,? our? system? requires? the? Overseer?(such? as? a? nurse)? to? specify? the? patient?s? native?language? (in? our? example?Chinese?Mandarin)? and?problem? sub?domain? (in? our? example? asthma).?From?there,? the?Overseer?can? either?speak?a?ques??tion? as? defined? in? the? protocols? contained? within?the?ACAFE?system? (using?English),? or? select? one?using? the? terminal.? The? question? is? then? rendered?using? recorded? audio? (TTS? is? used? as? a? fall? back?strategy)? and? played? to? the? patient.? Once? the? pa??tient? responds? verbally? or? physically? (e.g.? nod? of?the? head),? the? Overseer? is? required? to? enter? that?response?into?the?system.?The?Overseer? is?capable?of?viewing?reports? that?detail? a?particular?patient?s? responses?prior? to? fur??ther?analysis/treatment,?or?they?can?view?statistical?reports.? As? a? proof? of? concept,? the? Overseer? can?generate? a? statistical? report? that? details? patient?background? precipitating? factors? (numbers? of? res??piratory?tract?infections,?cold?weather,?exercise?and?dust/pollens)?
4? Suggested?Scenario?The? triage? nurse? will? identify? the? patient?s? native?language? to? enable? the?correct?voice?system?trans??lator.?The?voice?system?will?translate?the?standard??
ized? asthma? management? plan? questions? into? the?patient?s?native?language.?Patient?will?answer?each?question?in?their?native?tongue.? The? voice? system? will? convert? this? infor??mation?into?the?ACAFE?system?format.?When?each?question? has? been? answered,? the? ACAFE? system?will? store? the? answers? and? the? voice? system? will?then?follow?through?to?the?next?ACAFE?question.?Upon? completion? of? the? set? of? ACAFE? based?questions? the?voice?system?will? then?provide?a?re??view?of?the?questions?with?answers?in?the?ACAFE?system?in?either?English?or?the?native?language.?A?voice?recording?will?also?be?stored?to?play?back?for?future?reference.?Triage?refers?to?the?answers?that?have?been?col??lated? in? the? ACAFE? system? via? the? assistance? of?the? voice? system.?This? information? can?be? under??stood?by?all?emergency?team?staff?as?the?voice?sys??tem? has? translated? the? answers? of? the? patient? into?English?according?to?the?standardized?management?answers.?The? Emergency? Department? now? has? a? pre??compiled?list?of?patient?information?compliant?with?Stage? 1? of? the? clinical? pathway? contained? in? the?ACAFE? system? to? help? assist? in? the? treatment? of?asthma,?without? having? to?worry? about? communi??cation? difficulties? between? patient? and? medical?staff.?4.1? Demo?script?Triage? Nurse:? ?Hello,? what? pains? or? difficulties?are?you?experiencing???Patient:??Understand?English?no?good,?asthma???Triage? Nurse:? ?Can? you? confirm? your? language,?Mandarin?or?Cantonese???Patient:??Chinese,?mandarin.??Triage?Nurse:? ?OK,?what? I?will? do? now? is? use? a?special?machine?to?ask?a?few?simple?questions,?you?can?just?answer?yes?or?no,?it?will?ask?the?questions?in? mandarin? so? you? can? understand? better.?
