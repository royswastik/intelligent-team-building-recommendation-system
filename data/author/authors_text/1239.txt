Abstract 
We propose a new approach to text 
categorization based upon the ideas of 
summarization. It combines word-based 
frequency and position method to get 
categorization k owledge from the title field 
only. Experimental results indicate that 
summarization-based categorization can 
achieve acceptable performance on Reuters 
news corpus. 
Introduction 
With the current explosive growth of Interact 
usage, the demand for fast and useful access to 
online data is increasing. An efficient 
categorization system should provide accurate 
information quickly. There are many 
applications for text categorization, including 
information retrieval, text routing, text filtering 
and text understanding systems. 
The text categorization systems use 
predefmed categories to label new documents. 
Many different approaches have been applied to 
this task, including nearest neighbor classifiers 
(Masand, Linoff and Waltz, 1992; Yang, 1994; 
Lain and Ho, 1998; Yang, 1999), Bayesian 
independence lassifiers (Lewis and Ringuette, 
1994; Baker and McCallum, 1998; McCallum 
and Nigam, 1998), decision trees (Fuhr et al, 
1991; Lewis and Ringuette, 1994; Apte et al, 
1998), induction rule learning (Apte et al, 1994; 
Cohen and Singer, 1996; Mouilinier et al, 1996), 
neural networks (Wiener, Pedersen and Weigend, 
1995; Ng, Gob and Low, 1997), and support 
vector machines (Joachims, 1998). These 
categorization algorithms have been applied to 
many different subject domains, usually news 
stories (Apte et al, 1994; Lewis and Ringuette, 
1994; Wiener, Pedersen and Weigend, 1995; 
Yang, 1999), but also physics abstracts (Fuhr et 
al., 1991), and medical texts (Yang and Chute, 
1994). 
In this research to resolve the task of text 
categorization we apply a method of text 
summarization, that is, combining word-based 
frequency and position method to get 
categorization knowledge from the title field 
only. Experimental results indicate that 
summarization-based categorization can achieve 
acceptable performance on Reuters news corpus. 
Additionally, the computation time for the title 
field is very short. Thus, this system is 
appropriate for online document classifier. 
Following is a description of the organization 
of this paper. Section 2 describes the previous 
work of summarization. Summarization-based 
algorithms for text categorization are outlined in 
Section 3. The experiments we undertook to 
assess the performance of these algorithms are 
the topic of Section 4. Quantitative 
experimental results are also summarized. 
Finally, concluding remarks and 
recommendation f r future work is made. 
1 Text Summarization 
The task of summarization is to identify 
informative vidence from a given document, 
which are most relevant to its content and create 
a shorter version of smnmary of the document 
from this information. The informative 
evidence associated with techniques used in 
summarization may also provide clues for text 
categorization to determine the appropriate 
category of the document. 
Several techniques for text summarization 
have been reported in the literature, including 
methods based on position (Edmundson, 1969; 
Hovy and Lin, 1997; Teufel and Moens, 1997), 
cue phrase (McKeown and Radev, 1995; 
Mahesh, 1997), word frequency (Teufel and 
Moens, 1997), and discourse segmentation 
(Boguraev and Kennedy, 1997). 
79 
Of the above approaches, both word 
frequency and position methods are easy to 
implement. In this research we combine these 
two approaches to investigate the efforts for 
categorization.. In regard to the position 
method, Hovy and Lin (1997) considered the 
title is the most likely to bear topics. They 
claim words in titles are positively relevant o 
summarization. Teufel and Moens (1997) also 
confirmed this viewpoint; they mentioned that 
words in the title are good candidates for 
document specific concepts. They showed 
21.7% recall and precision, when the title 
method is used alone, with an increased 
performance of 3%, when combined with other 
methods. 
Furthermore, from observation of the TREC 
evaluation during recent years, it has been 
shown that there is no significant difference 
between short and long query. It seems 
reasonable to acquire informative clues from the 
title, still not degrading the categorization 
performance s verely. 
2 Methods 
This section describes a series of algorithms 
based on the title summarization technique for 
text categorization. 
2.1 Preprocessing and Feature Selection 
We divide the corpus texts into words, delineate 
by white space and punctuation. All characters 
are lower-case and stop words are removed. 
After the words are stemmed, we call them 
terms. These terms are then used as features. 
2.2 Term Weighting 
Weights are now assigned to the surviving 
features in each category. We design several 
different formulas for term weighting. In each 
formula, we associate a weight, W~ c), with 
each surviving feature, f, in category c, in the 
same way weights can be obtained in 
information retrieval when assigning them to 
index terms. In addition, we normalize the 
value of term frequency, q, between categories. 
The probability of category is also taken into 
account. We define W~ c) as equations 1 
through 3. 
W(f,  c) = tff,~ x idf/ (Eq. l-a) 
Maxc 
where 0~ = 
T=

appearing in the category c, 
the number of categories, 
the number of categories that 
contain the featureL 
the maximum frequency of any 
feature in category c, 
the document numbers belonging 
category c in training sets. 
2.3 Category Ranking 
We now have an index suitable for use in the 
category ranking process. The index contains 
features and a weighted value, W(f, c), 
associated with each feature f in  each category c. 
Given a document, d, a rank can be associated 
with each category with respect to d. Let Fc is 
the set of features,f, in category c. The ranking 
of category c with respect to document d, R(c, d), 
is defined as equation 4. 
R(c,d) = g ~f .axW( f ,c )  (Eq. 4) 
f~  Fc ~d 
where tf:~ = the frequency of the feature f 
appearing in the document d, 
F~= the set of features f in  category c. 
3 Experiments 
To assess the proposed method's effectiveness, 
we apply the algorithms described in the 
previous section and conduct a series of 
experiments. Tests are performed on the 
Reuters corpus. A general description of the 
materials used in these experiments follows. 
Finally, the success rates are quantitatively 
evaluated. 
3.1 The Reuters Corpus 
To make our effectiveness comparable to other 
researchers' results in text categorization, we 
chose the commonly used Reuters news story 
corpus for the data. This corpus has many 
different versions. Yang (1999) points out 
80 
there are at least five versions of the Reuters 
corpus, depending on how the training/test ets 
are divided and the scope of categories or 
documents used for evaluation. In this paper, 
we select the Reuters version 3 (a formatted 
version is currently available at Yang's 
homepage http://moscow.mt.cs.cmu.edu: 
8081/reuters 21450/apte), constructed by Apte 
et al, as our data set. 
This version contains 7,789 training and 3,309 
test documents within 93 categories. The 
distribution of category number is tabulated in 
Table 1. Most of these documents have only a 
single category, but some documents are 
multicategory. The average numbers of 
categories per document are 1.23 and 1.24 on 
training and test sets, respectively. The number 
of training documents per category varies widely, 
from 2 (dr, fishmeal . . . . .  etc.) to a maximum of 
2,877 (earn). Tables 2 and 3 show the top ten 
most frequent categories and ten least frequent 
categories on the training sets. The average 
length of title field and whole document are 7.4 
and 126.9 words per document, respectively. 
3.2 Experimental Design 
In this paper, we only use TITLE field as the 
scope of texts. In our first experiment, the 
variable is variant erm weighting formulas that 
are described in Section 3. We want to see the 
effects on categorization performance, when 
probability of  category and normalized process 
of term frequency are used. The first 
experiment is summarized in Table 4. 
A second experiment is to locate the most 
preferred threshold value of minimum term 
frequency. For the number of features in our 
experiment, the values 10, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200, 
300 and 900 are tested. 
3.3 Experimental Results and 
Discussion 
We survey the effectiveness of our algorithms 
by using the conventional  1-point average 
precision (Salton and McGill, 1983; Yang 
1999). 
We first investigate a suitable term weighted 
formula by doing a set of initial categorization 
from Method 1 through 4. Threshold of 
minimum term frequency is fixed at 3. The 
results are tabulated in Table 5. It can be seen

It seems to point out that" small text size (only 
TITLE field is used) is not bad for text 
categorization, when compared with kNN's 93% 
and LLSF's 92% for full texts (Yang, 1999). 
The other experimental variable is the number 
of chosen features. Table 5 shows the large 
feature sets earn the better result when 
probability isabsent. 
In the next experiment, with the term 
weighting formula fixed at Eq. 1-d (Method 4), 
we vary the minimum number of term frequency 
from 1 to 3. Table 6 indicates that here are no 
significant differences among judgements, but 
shows a little improvement for those small 
threshold values. The data also shows that the 
information contained in the title field is almost 
come together and very little noise. Thus, it 
seems to have no effects for the processing of 
sparse data.

Conclusion 
In this paper, we apply the most popular 
methods, in text summarization, position and 
word frequency, to resolve the task of text 
categorization. We use a word-based term 
weighted technique from the title field, which is 
informative but short in length, to process 
eategofzation. The results show short title 
field will reduce execution time, and provide 
acceptable performance. Thus, this system 
would be appropriate for an online document 
classifier. 
Previous work shows the hybrid approach for 
the text categorization and summarization is 
more efficient than a single scheme. Thus, we 
will try to combine several schemes in the future. 
In addition, in the position method, we could use 
hybrid structure to consider the title and some 
specific position in the document, for instance, 
the first sentence in the first paragraph or the 
first sentence in the second paragraph. When 
there is insufficient information i title field, it is 
helpful to proceed to the next position.
