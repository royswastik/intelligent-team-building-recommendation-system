Abstract* 
 
Anchor text plays a special important role in 
improving the performance of general Web 
search, due to the fact that it is relatively ob-
jective description for a Web page by poten-
tially a large number of other Web pages. 
Academic Search provides indexing and 
search functionality for academic articles. It 
may be desirable to utilize anchor text in aca-
demic search as well to improve the search re-
sults quality. The main challenge here is that 
no explicit URLs and anchor text is available 
for academic articles. In this paper we define 
and automatically assign a pseudo-URL for 
each academic article. And a machine learning 
approach is adopted to extract pseudo-anchor 
text for academic articles, by exploiting the ci-
tation relationship between them. The ex-
tracted pseudo-anchor text is then indexed and 
involved in the relevance score computation of 
academic articles. Experiments conducted on 
0.9 million research papers show that our ap-
proach is able to dramatically improve search 
performance. 
1 Introduction 
Anchor text is a piece of clickable text that links 
to a target Web page. In general Web search, 
anchor text plays an extremely important role in 
improving the search quality. The main reason 
for this is that anchor text actually aggregates the 
opinion (which is more comprehensive, accurate, 
and objective) of a potentially large number of 
people for a Web page. 
                                                 
* This work was performed when Fei Xing and Mingjie Zhu 
were interns at Microsoft Research Asia. 
In recent years, academic search (Giles et al, 
1998; Lawrence et al, 1999; Nie et al, 2005; 
Chakrabarti et al, 2006) has become an impor-
tant supplement to general web search for re-
trieving research articles. Several academic 
search systems (including Google Scholar?, Cite-
seer?, DBLP?, Libra**, ArnetMiner??, etc.) have 
been deployed. In order to improve the results 
quality of an academic search system, we may 
consider exploiting the techniques which are 
demonstrated to be quite useful and critical in 
general Web search. In this paper, we study the 
possibility of extracting anchor text for research 
papers and using them to improve the search per-
formance of an academic search system.

The basic search unit in most academic search 
systems is a research paper. Borrowing the con-
cepts of URL and anchor-text in general Web 
search, we may need to assign a pseudo-URL for 
one research paper as its identifier and to define 
the pseudo-anchor text for it by the contextual 
description when this paper is referenced (or 
mentioned). The pseudo-URL of a research pa-
per could be the combination of its title, authors 
and publication information. Figure-1 shows an 
excerpt where one paper cites a couple of other

papers. The grayed text can be treated as the 
pseudo-anchor text of the papers being refe-
renced. Once the pseudo-anchor text of research 
papers is acquired, it can be indexed and utilized 
to help ranking, just as in general web search. 
However it remains a challenging task to cor-
rectly identify and extract these pseudo-URLs 
and pseudo-anchor texts. First, unlike the situa-
tion in general web search where one unique 
URL is assigned to each web page as a natural 
identifier, the information of research papers 
need to be extracted from web pages or PDF files. 
As a result, in constructing pseudo-URLs for 
research papers, we may face the problem of ex-
traction errors, typos, and the case of one re-
search paper having different expressions in dif-
ferent places. Second, in general Web search, 
anchor text is always explicitly specified by 
HTML tags (<a> and </a>). It is however much 
harder to perform anchor text extraction for re-
search papers. For example, human knowledge 
may be required in Figure-1 to accurately identi-
fy the description of every cited paper. 
To address the above challenges, we propose 
an approach for extracting and utilizing pseudo-
anchor text information in academic search to 
improve the search results quality. Our approach 
is composed of three phases. In the first phase, 
each time a paper is cited in another paper, we 
construct a tentative pseudo-URL for the cited 
paper and extract a candidate anchor block for it. 
The tentative pseudo-URL and the candidate 
anchor block are allowed to be inaccurate. In the 
second phase, we merge the tentative pseudo-
URLs that should represent the same paper. All 
candidate anchor blocks belong to the same pa-
per are grouped accordingly in this phase. In the 
third phase, the final pseudo-anchor text of each 
paper is generated from all its candidate blocks, 
by adopting a SVM-based machine learning me-
thodology. We conduct experiments upon a data-
set containing 0.9 million research papers. The 
experimental results show that lots of useful anc-
hor text can be successfully extracted and accu-
mulated using our approach, and the ultimate 
search performance is dramatically improved 
when anchor information is indexed and used for 
paper ranking. 
The remaining part of this paper is organized 
as follows. In Section 2, we describe in detail our 
approach for pseudo-anchor text extraction and 
accumulation. Experimental results are reported 
in Section 3. We discuss related work in Section 
4 and finally conclude the paper in Section 5. 
2 Our Approach 
2.1 Overview 
Before describing our approach in detail, we first 
recall how anchor text is processed in general 
Web search. Assume that there have been a col-
lection of documents being crawled and stored 
on local disk. In the first step, each web page is 
parsed and the out links (or forward links) within 
the page are extracted. Each link is comprised of 
a URL and its corresponding anchor text. In the 
second step, all links are accumulated according 
to their destination URLs (i.e. the anchor texts of 
all links pointed to the same URL are merged). 
Thus, we can get al anchor text corresponding to 
each web page. Figure-2 (a) demonstrates this 
process. 
 
 
Figure 2. The main process of extracting (a) anchor 
text in general web search and (b) pseudo-anchor text 
in academic search 
 
For academic search, we need to extract and 
parse the text content of papers. When a paper A 
mentions another paper B, it either explicitly or 
implicitly displays the key information of B to let 
the users know that it is referencing B instead of 
other papers. Such information can be extracted 
to construct the tentative pseudo-URL of B. The 
pseudo-URLs constructed in this phase are tenta-
tive because different tentative pseudo-URLs 
may be merged to generate the same final pseu-
do-URL. All information related to paper B in 
different papers can be accumulated and treated

as the potential anchor text of B. Our goal is to 
get the anchor text related to each paper. 
Our approach for pseudo-anchor text extrac-
tion is shown in Figure-2 (b). The key process is 
similar to that in general Web search for accumu-
lating and utilizing page anchor text. One prima-
ry difference between Figure-2 (a) and (b) is the 
latter accumulates candidate anchor blocks rather 
than pieces of anchor text. A candidate anchor 
block is a piece of text that contains the descrip-
tion of one paper. The basic idea is: Instead of 
extracting the anchor text for a paper directly (a 
difficult task because of the lack of enough in-
formation), we first construct a candidate anchor 
block to contain the "possible" or "potential" de-
scription of the paper. After we accumulate all 
candidate anchor blocks, we have more informa-
tion to provide a better estimation about which 
pieces of texts are anchor texts. Following this 
idea, our proposed approach adopts a three-phase 
methodology to extract pseudo-anchor text. In 
the first phase, each time a paper B appearing in 
another paper A, a candidate anchor block is ex-
tracted for B. All candidate anchor blocks belong 
to the same paper are grouped in the second 
phase. In the third phase, the final pseudo-anchor 
text of each paper is selected among all candidate 
blocks. 
Extracting tentative pseudo-URLs and can-
didate anchor blocks: When one paper cites 
another paper, a piece of short text (e.g. "[1]" or 
?(xxx et al, 2008)?) is commonly inserted to 
represent the paper to be cited, and the detail in-
formation (key attributes) of it are typically put 
at the end of the document (in the references sec-
tion). We call each paper listed in the references 
section a reference item. The references section 
can be located by searching for the last occur-
rence of term 'reference' or 'references' in larger 
fonts. Then, we adopt a rule-based approach to 
divide the text in the references section into ref-
erence items. Another rule-based approach is 
used to extract paper attributes (title, authors, 
year, etc) from a reference item. We observed 
some errors in our resulting pseudo-URLs caused 
by the quality of HTML files converted from 
PDF format, reference item extraction errors, 
paper attribute extraction errors, and other fac-
tors. We also observed different reference item 
formats for the same paper. The pseudo-URL for 
a paper is defined according to its title, authors, 
publisher, and publication year, because these 
four kinds of information can readily be used to 
identify a paper. 
For each citation of a paper, we treat the sen-
tence containing the reference point (or citation 
point) as one candidate anchor block. When mul-
tiple papers are cited in one sentence, we treat 
the sentence as the candidate anchor block of 
every destination paper. 
Candidate Anchor Block Accumulation: 
This phase is in charge of merging all candidate 
blocks of the same pseudo-URL. As has been 
discussed, tentative pseudo-URLs are often inac-
curate; and different tentative pseudo-URLs may 
correspond to the same paper. The primary chal-
lenge here is perform the task in an efficient way 
and with high accuracy. We will address this 
problem in Subsection 2.2. 
Pseudo-Anchor Generation: In the previous 
phase, all candidate blocks of each paper have 
been accumulated. This phase is to generate the 
final anchor text for each paper from all its can-
didate blocks. Please refer to Subsection 2.3 for 
details. 
2.2 Candidate Anchor Block Accumulation 
via Multiple Feature-String Hashing 
Consider this problem: Given a potentially huge 
number of tentative pseudo-URLs for papers, we 
need to identify and merge the tentative pseudo-
URLs that represent the same paper. This is like 
the problems in the record linkage (Fellegi and 
Sunter, 1969), entity matching, and data integra-
tion which have been extensively studied in da-
tabase, AI, and other areas. In this sub-section, 
we will first show the major challenges and the 
previous similar work on this kind of problem. 
Then a possible approach is described to achieve 
a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. 
 
 
Figure 3. Two tentative pseudo-URLs representing 
the same paper 
 
2.2.1 Challenges and candidate techniques 
Two issues should be addressed for this problem: 
similarity measurement, and the efficiency of the 
algorithm. On one hand, a proper similarity func-
tion is needed to identify two tentative pseudo-
URLs representing the same paper. Second, the 
12
integration process has to be accomplished effi-
ciently. 
We choose to compute the similarity between 
two papers to be a linear combination of the si-
milarities on the following fields: title, authors, 
venue (conference/journal name), and year. The 
similarity function on each field is carefully de-
signed. For paper title, we adopt a term-level edit 
distance to compute similarity. And for paper 
authors, person name abbreviation is considered. 
The similarity function we adopted is fairly well 
in accuracy (e.g., the similarity between the two 
pseudo-URLs in Figure-3 is high according to 
our function); but it is quite time-consuming to 
compute the similarity for each pair of papers 
(roughly 1012 similarity computation operations 
are needed for 1 million different tentative pseu-
do-URLs). 
Some existing methods are available for de-
creasing the times of similarity calculation opera-
tions. McCallum et al (2000) addresses this high 
dimensional data clustering problem by dividing 
data into overlapping subsets called canopies 
according to a cheap, approximate distance mea-
surement. Then the clustering process is per-
formed by measuring the exact distances only 
between objects from the same canopy. There are 
also other subspace methods (Parsons et al, 2004) 
in data clustering areas, where data are divided 
into subspaces of high dimensional spaces first 
and then processing is done in these subspaces. 
Also there are fast blocking approaches for 
record linkage in Baxter et al (2003). Though 
they may have different names, they hold similar 
ideas of dividing data into subsets to reduce the 
candidate comparison records. The size of data-
set used in the above papers is typically quite 
small (about thousands of data items). For effi-
ciency issue, Broder et al (1997) proposed a 
shingling approach to detect similar Web pages. 
They noticed that it is infeasible to compare 
sketches (which are generated by shingling) of 
all pairs of documents. So they built an inverted 
index that contains a list of shingle values and 
the documents they appearing in. With the in-
verted index, they can effectively generate a list 
of all the pairs of documents that share any shin-
gles, along with the number of shingles they 
have in common. They did experiments on a da-
taset containing 30 million documents. 
By adopting the main ideas of the above tech-
niques to our pseudo-URL matching problem, a 
possible approach can be as follows. 
 
 
Figure 4. The Multiple Feature-String Hashing algo-
rithm for candidate anchor block accumulation 
 
2.2.2 Method adopted 
The method utilized here for candidate anchor 
block accumulation is shown in Figure 4. The 
main idea is to construct a certain number of fea-
ture strings for a tentative pseudo-URL (abbre-
viated as TP-URL) and do hash for the feature 
strings. A feature string of a paper is a small 
piece of text which records a part of the paper?s 
key information, satisfying the following condi-
tions: First, multiple feature strings can typically 
be built from a TP-URL. Second, if two TP-
URLs are different representations of the same 
paper, then the probability that they have at least 
one common feature string is extremely high. We 
can choose the term-level n-grams of paper titles 
(referring to Section 3.4) as feature strings. 
The algorithm maintains an in-memory hash-
table which contains a lot of slots each of which 
is a list of TP-URLs belonging to this slot. For 
each TP-URL, feature strings are generated and 
hashed by a specified hash function. The TP-
URL is then added into some slots according to 
the hash values of its feature strings. Any two 
TP-URLs belonging to the same slot are further 
compared by utilizing our similarity function. If 
their similarity is larger than a threshold, the two 
TP-URLs are treated as being the same and 
therefore their corresponding candidate anchor 
blocks are merged. 
The above algorithm tries to achieve good bal-
ance between accuracy and performance. On one 
hand, compared with the na?ve algorithm of per-
forming one-one comparison between all pairs of 
TP-URLs, the algorithm needs only to compute

and candidate anchor blocks)

pers)

the similarity for the TP-URLs that share a 
common slot. On the other hand, because of the 
special property of feature strings, most TP-
URLs representing the same paper can be de-
tected and merged. 
The basic idea of dividing data into over-
lapped subsets is inherited from McCallum et al 
(2000), Broder et al (1997), and some subspace 
clustering approaches. Slightly different, we do 
not count the number of common feature strings 
between TP-URLs. Common bins (or inverted 
indices) between data points are calculated in 
McCallum et al (2000) as a ?cheap distance? for 
creating canopies. The number of common Shin-
gles between two Web documents is calculated 
(efficiently via inverted indices), such that Jac-
card similarity could be used to measure the si-
milarity between them. In our case, we simply 
compare any two TP-URLs in the same slot by 
using our similarity function directly. 
The effective and efficiency of this algorithm 
depend on the selection of feature strings. For a 
fixed feature string generation method, the per-
formance of this algorithm is affected by the size 
of each slot, especially the number and size of 
big slots (slots with size larger than a threshold). 
Big slots will be discarded in the algorithm to 
improve performance, just like removing com-
mon Shingles in Broder et al (1997). In Section 
4, we conduct experiments to test the perfor-
mance of the above algorithm with different fea-
ture string functions and different slot size thre-
sholds. 
2.3 Pseudo-Anchor Text Learning 
In this subsection, we address the problem of 
extracting the final pseudo-anchor text for a pa-
per, given all its candidate anchor blocks (see 
Figure 5 for an example). 
2.3.1 Problem definition 
A candidate anchor block is a piece of text with 
one or some reference points (a reference point is 
one occurrence of citation in a paper) specified, 
where a reference point is denoted by a 
<start_pos, end_pos> pair (means start position 
and end position respectively): ref = <start_pos, 
end_pos>. We represent a candidate anchor 
block to be the following format, 
AnchorBlock = (Text, ref1, ref2, ?) 
We define a block set to be a set of candidate 
anchor blocks for a paper, 
BlockSet = {AnchorBlock1, AnchorBlock2, ?} 
Now the problem is: Given a block set con-
taining N elements, extract some text excerpts 
from them as the anchor text of the paper. 
2.3.2 Learn term weights 
We adopt a machine-learning approach to assign, 
for each term in the anchor blocks, a discrete de-
gree of being anchor text. The main reasons for 
taking such an approach is twofold: First, we 
believe that assigning each term a fuzzy degree 
of being anchor text is more appropriate than a 
binary judgment as either an anchor-term or non-
anchor-term. Second, since the importance of a 
term for a ?link? may be determined by many 
factors in paper search, a machine-learning could 
be more flexible and general than the approaches 
that compute term degrees by a specially de-
signed formula. 
 
 
Figure 5. The candidate pseudo-anchor blocks of a 
paper 
 
The features used for learning are listed in Ta-
ble-1. 
We observed that it would be more effective if 
some of the above features are normalized before 
being used for learning. For a term in candidate 
anchor block B, its TF are normalized by the 
BM25 formula (Robertson et al, 1999),

where L is average length of the candidate blocks,

DF is normalized by the following formula, 
 )1log( DF

where N is the number of elements in the block 
set (i.e. total number of candidate anchor blocks 
for the current paper). 
Features RefPos and Dist are normalized as, 
 
RefPosnorm = RefPos / |B| 
Distnorm = (Dist-RefPos) / |B| 
 
And the feature BlockLen is normalized as,

which the term appears, counted among all candidate 
blocks of all papers. It is used to indicate whether the 
term is a stop word or not.

which the term appears, counted among all candidate 
blocks of this paper.

occurrences in one block, all of them are counted.

Table 1. Features for learning 
 
We set four term importance levels, from 1 
(unrelated terms or stop words) to 4 (words par-
ticipating in describing the main ideas of the pa-
per). 
We choose support vector machine (SVM) for 
learning term weights here, because of its power-
ful classification ability and well generalization 
ability (Burges, 1998). We believe some other 
machine learning techniques should also work 
here. The input of the classifier is a feature vec-
tor of a term and the output is the importance 
level of the term. Given a set of training data 
? ?liii levelfeature 1, ?, a decision function f(x) can be 
acquired after training. Using the decision func-
tion, we can assign an importance level for each 
term automatically. 
 
3 Experiments 
3.1 Experimental Setup 
Our experimental dataset contains 0.9 million 
papers crawled from the web. All the papers are 
processed according to the process in Figure-2 
(b). We randomly select 300 queries from the 
query log of Libra (libra.msra.cn) and retrieve 
the results in our indexing and ranking system 
with/without the pseudo-anchors generated by 
our approach. Then the volunteer researchers and 
students in our group are involved to judge the 
search results. The top 30 results of different 
ranking algorithms for each query are labeled 
and assigned a relevance value from 1 (meaning 
'poor match') to 5 (meaning 'perfect match'). The 
search results quality is measured by NDCG 
(Jarvelin and Kekalainen, 2000).

Figure 6. Comparison between the baseline approach 
and our approach (measure: nDCG) 
 
The ?Base? algorithm considers the title, ab-
stract, full-text and static-rank (which is a func-
tion of the citation count) of a paper. In a bit 
more detail, for each paper, we adopt the BM25 
formula (Robertson et al, 1999) over its title, 
abstract, and full-text respectively. And then the 
resulting score is linearly combined with the stat-
ic-rank to get its final score. The static-rank is 
computed as follows, 
 StaticRank = log(1+CitationCount) (3.1) 
To test the performance of including pseudo-
anchor text in ranking, we compute an anchor 
score for each paper and linearly combine it with 
its baseline score (i.e. the score computed by the 
baseline algorithm). 
We tried two kinds of ways for anchor score 
computation. The first is to merge all pieces of 
anchor excerpts (extracted in the previous section) 
into a larger piece of anchor text, and use BM25 
to compute its relevance score. In another ap-
proach called homogeneous evidence combina-
tion (Shi et al, 2006), a relevance score is com-
puted for each anchor excerpt (still using BM25), 
and all the scores for the excerpts are sorted des-
cending and then combined by the following 
formula, 
 ?
?
?????
m
i
ianchor sicS 1 2))1(1(
1 (3.2) 
where si (i=1, ?, m) are scores for the m anchor 
excerpts, and c is a parameter. The primary idea 
15
here is to let larger scores to have relative greater 
weights. Please refer to Shi et al (2006) for a 
justification of this approach. As we get slightly 
better results with the latter way, we use it as our 
final choice for computing anchor scores. 
From Figure 6, we can see that the overall per-
formance is greatly improved by including pseu-
do-anchor information. Table 2 shows the t-test 
results, where a ?>? indicates that the algorithm 
in the row outperforms that in the column with a 
p-value of 0.05 or less, and a ?>>? means a p-
value of 0.01 or less.

3.3 Sample Query Analysis 
Here we analyze some sample queries to get 
some insights about why and how pseudo-anchor 
improves search performance. Figure-7 and Fig-
ure-8 show the top-3 results of two sample que-
ries: {TF-IDF} and {Page Rank}. 
For query "TF-IDF", the top results of the 
baseline approach have keyword "TF-IDF" ap-
peared in the title as well as in other places of the 
papers. Although the returned papers are relevant 
to the query, they are not excellent because typi-
cally users may want to get the first TF-IDF pa-
per or some papers introducing TF-IDF. When 
pseudo-anchor information is involved, some 
excellent results (B1, B2, B3) are generated. The 
main reason for getting the improved results is 
that these papers (or books) are described with 
"TF-IDF" when lots of other papers cite them. 
 
 
Figure 7. Top-3 results for query TF-IDF 
 
 
Figure 8. Top-3 results for query Page Rank 
 
Figure-8 shows another example about how 
pseudo-anchor helps to improve search results 
quality. For query "Page Rank" (note that there is 
a space in between), the results returned by the 
baseline approach are not satisfactory. In the pa-
pers returned by our approach, at least B1 and B2 
are very good results. Although they did not la-
bel themselves "Page Rank", other papers do so 
in citing them. Interestingly, although the result 
B3 is not about the "PageRank" algorithm, it de-
scribes another popular "Page Rank" algorithm 
in addition to PageRank. 
Another interesting observation from the two 
figures is that our approach retrieves older papers 
than the baseline method, because old papers 
tend to have more anchor text (due to more cita-
tions). So our approach may not be suitable for 
retrieve newer papers. To overcome this problem, 
maybe publication year should be considered in 
our ranking functions. 
3.4 Anchor Accumulation Experiments 
We conduct experiments to test the effectiveness 
and efficiency of the multiple-feature-string-
hashing algorithm presented in Section 2.2. The 
duplication detection quality of this algorithm is 
determined by the appropriate selection of fea-

slot size threshold can be used to tune the tra-
deoff between accuracy and performance.

Table 4. Slot distribution with different feature strings 
 
We take all the papers extracted from PDF 
files as input to run the algorithm. Identical TP-
URLs are first eliminated (therefore their candi-
date anchor blocks are merged) by utilizing a 
hash table. This pre-process step results in about 
1.46 million distinct TP-URLs. The number is 
larger than our collection size (0.9 million), be-
cause some cited papers are not in our paper col-
lection. We tested four kinds of feature strings all 
of which are generated from paper title: uni-
grams, bigrams, trigrams, and 4-grams. Table-4 
shows the slot size distribution corresponding to 
each kind of feature strings. The performance 
comparison among different feature strings and 
slot size thresholds is shown in Table 5. It seems 
that bigrams achieve a good trade-off between 
accuracy and performance.

4 Related Work 
There has been some work which uses anchor 
text or their surrounding text for various Web 
information retrieval tasks. It was known at the 
very beginning era of internet that anchor text 
was useful to Web search (McBryan, 1994). 
Most Web search engines now use anchor text as 
primary and power evidence for improving 
search performance. The idea of using contextual 
text in a certain vicinity of the anchor text was 
proposed in Chakrabarti et al (1998) to automat-
ically compile some lists of authoritative Web 
resources on a range of topics. An anchor win-
dow approach is proposed in Chakrabarti et al
(1998) to extract implicit anchor text. Following 
this work, anchor windows were considered in 
some other tasks (Amitay  et al, 1998; Haveli-
wala et al, 2002; Davison, 2002; Attardi et al, 
1999). Although we are inspired by these ideas, 
our work is different because research papers 
have many different properties from Web pages. 
From the viewpoint of implicit anchor extraction 
techniques, our approach is different from the 
anchor window approach. The anchor window 
approach is somewhat simpler and easy to im-
plement than ours. However, our method is more 
general and flexible. In our approach, the anchor 
text is not necessarily to be in a window. 
Citeseer (Giles et al, 1998; Lawrence  et al, 
1999) has been doing a lot of valuable work on 
citation recognition, reference matching, and pa-
per indexing. It has been displaying contextual 
information for cited papers. This feature has 
been shown to be helpful and useful for re-
searchers. Differently, we are using context de-
scription for improving ranking rather than dis-
play purpose. In addition to Citeseer, some other 
work (McCallum et al, 1999; Nanba and Oku-
mura, 1999; Nanba et al, 2004; Shi et al, 2006) 
is also available for extracting and accumulating 
reference information for research papers. 
5 Conclusions and Future Work 
In this paper, we propose to improve academic 
search by utilizing pseudo-anchor information. 
As pseudo-URL and pseudo-anchor text are not 
as explicit as in general web search, more efforts 
are needed for pseudo-anchor extraction. Our 
machine-learning approach has proven success-
ful in automatically extracting implicit anchor 
text. By using the pseudo-anchors in our academ-
ic search system, we see a significant perfor-
mance improvement over the basic approach.
