Abstract 
This paper describes the design 
criteria and annotation guidelines of 
Sinica Treebank. The three design 
criteria are: Maximal Resource Sharing, 
Minimal Structural Complexity, and 
Optimal Semantic Information. One of 
the important design decisions 
following these criteria is the encoding 
of thematic role information. An on-line 
interface facilitating empirical studies of 
Chinese phrase structure is also 
described. 
1. Introduction 
The Penn Treebank (Marcus et al 
1993) initiated a new paradigm in 
corpus-based research. The English. 
Penn Treebank has enabled and 
motivated corpus and computational 
linguistic research based on information 
extractable from structurally annotated 
corpora. Recently, the research has 
focused on the following two issues: 
first, when and how can a structurally 
annotated corpus of language X be 
built? 
Second, what information should or 
can be annotated? A good sample of 
issues in these two directions can be 
found in the papers collected in Abeille 
(1999). 
The construction of the Sinica 
Treebank deals with both issues. First, it 
is one of the first structurally annotated 
corpora in Mandarin Chinese. Second, 
as a design feature, the Sinica Treebank 
annotation includes thematic role 
information in addition to syntactic 
categories. In this paper, we will discuss 
the design criteria and annotation 
guidelines of the Sinica Treebank. We 
will also give a preliminary research 
result based on the Sinica Treebank. 
2. Design Cr i te r ia  
There are three important design 
criteria for the Sinica Treebank: 
maximal resource sharing, minimal 
structural complexity, and optimal 
semantic information. 
First, to achieve maximal resource 
sharing, the construction of the Sinica 
Treebank is bootstrapped from existing 
29 
Chinese computational linguistic 
resources. The textual material is 
extracted from the tagged Sinica Corpus 
(hRp:l/www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms-bin/ 
kiwi.sh, Chen et al 1996). In other 
words, the tasks and issues involving 
tokenization / word segmentation and 
category assignment are previously 
resolved. It is worth noting that the 
segmentation and tagging of Sinica 
Corpus have undergone vigorous 
post-editing. Hence the precision of 
category-assignment is much higher 
than with an automatically tagged 
corpora. In addition, since the same 
research team carried out the tagging of 
Sinica Corpus and annotation of Sinica 
Treebank, consistency of the 
interpretation of texts and tags are 
ensured. For structure-assigument, an 
automatic parser (Chen 1996) is applied 
before human post-editing. 
Second) the criterion of minimal 
structural complexity is motivated to 
ensure that the assigned structural 
information can be shared regardless of 
users' theoretical presupposition. It is 
observed that theory-internal 
motivations often require abstract 
intermediate phrasal levels (such as in 
various versions of the X-bar theory). 
Other theories may also call for an 
abstract covert phrasal category (such as 
INFL in the GB theory for Chinese). In 
either case, although the phrasal 
categories are well-motivated within the 
theory, their significance cannot be 
maintained in the context of other 
theoretical frameworks. Since a primary 
goal of annotated corpora is to serve as 
the empirical base of linguistic 
investigations, it is desirable to annotate 
structure divisions that are the most 
commonly shared among theories. We 
came to the conclusion that the minimal 
basic level structures are the ones that 
are shared by all theories. Thus our 
annotation is designed to achieve 
minimal structural complexity. All 
abstract phrasal levels are eliminated 
and only canonical phrasal categories 
are marked. 
Third) a critical issue involving 
Treebank construction as well as 
theories of NLP is how much semantic 
information, if any, should be 
incorporated. The original Penn 
Treebank took a fairly straightforward 
syntactic approach. A purely semantic 
approach, though tempting in terms of 
theoretical and practical considerations, 
has never been attempted yet. A third 
approach is to annotate partial semantic 
information, especially those pertaining 
to argument-relations. This is an 
approach shared by us and the Prague 
Dependency Treebank (e.g. Bohmova 
and Hajikova 1999). In this approach, 
the thematic relation between a predicate 
and an argument is marked in addition to 
grammatical category. Note that the 
predicate-argument relation is usually 
grammatically instantiated and generally 
considered to be the semantic relation 
that interacts most closely with syntactic 
behavior. This allows optimal semantic 
30 
information to be encoded without going 
too beyond the partially automatic 
process of argument identification. 
3. Annotation Guidelines I: 
Category and Hierarchy 
The basic structure of a tree in a 
treebank is a hierarchy of nodes with 
categorical denotation. As in any 
standard phrase structure grammar, the 
lexieal (i.e. terrninal) symbols are 
defined.by the lexicon (CKIP 1992). 
And following the recent lexicon-driven 
and information=based trends in 
linguistic theory, linguistic information 
will be projected from encoded lexical 
information. Please refer to CKIP (1993) 
for the definition of lexieal categories 
that we followed. We will give below 
the inventory of the restricted set of 
phrasal categories used and their 
interpretation. This set defines the 
domain of expressed syntactic 
information (instead of projected or 
inherited information). Readers can also 
consult Chen et al's (2000) general 
description of how the Siniea Treebank 
is constructed for a more complete list of 
tags as well as explanation i Chinese. 
3.1. Defining Phrasal Categories 
There are only 6 non-terminal 
phrasal categories annotated in the 
Sinica Treebank. 
(1) Phrasal Categories 
1. S: An S is a complete tree headed by a 
predicate (i.e. S is the start symbol). 
2.VP: A VP is a phrase headed by a 
predicate. However, it lacks a 
subject and cannot function alone. 
3. NP: An NP is beaded by an N. 
4.GP: A GP is a phrase headed by 
locational noun or locational adjunct. 
Since the thematic role is often 
determined by the governing 
predicate and not encoded locally; 
nominal phrases are given a tentative 
role of DUMMY so that it can 
inherit he correct role from the main 
predicate. 
5. PP: A PP is headed by a preposition. 
The thematic role of its argument is 
inherited from the mother, hence its 
argument is marked with a 
DUMMY. 
6. XP: A XP is a conjunctive phrase that 
is headed by a conjunction. Its 
syntactic head is the conjunction. 
However, since the actual category 
depends on the interactive 
inheritance from possibly 
non-identical conjoined elements, X 
in XP stands for an under-specified 
category. 
3.2. Defining Inheritance Relations 
Following unification-based 
grammatical theories, categorical 
assignments in Sinica Treebank are both 
lexicon-driven and head-driven. In 
principle, all grammatical information is
lexically encoded. Structurally heads 
indicate the direction of information 
inheritance and define possible 
predicate-argument relations. However, 
since the notion 'head' can have several 
31 
different linguistic definitions, we 
attempt to allow at least the discrepancy 
between syntactic and semantic heads. 
In Sinica Treebank, three different kinds 
of grammatical heads are annotated. 
(2) Heads 
1.Head: indicates a grammatical head in 
an endocentrie phrasal category. 
Unless a different semantic head is 
explicitly marked, a Head marks a 
category that serves simultaneously as
the syntactic and semantic heads of the 
construction. 
2.head: indicates a semantic head which 
does not simultaneously function as a 
syntactic head. For instance in 
constructions involving 
grammatiealized 'particles,' such as in 
the 'VP-de' construction, the 
grammatical head ('de' in this case) 
does not carry any semantic 
information. In these cases, the head 
marks the semantic head ('VP" in this 
case) to indicate the flow of content 
information. 
3. DUMMY: indicates the semantic 
head(s) whose categorical or thematic 
identity cannot be locally determined. 
The two most likely scenarios 
involving DUMMY are (a) in a 
coordination construction, where the 
head category depends on the sum of 
all conjuncts. And (b) in a non-NP 
argument phrase, such as PP, where 
the semantic head carries a thematic 
role assigned not by the immediate 
governing syntactic head ("P" in this 
case), but by a higher predicate. In 
these cases, DUMMY allows a parser 
to determine the correct categorical / 
thematic relation later, while 
maintaining identical local structures. 
3.3. Beyond Simple Inheritance 
When simple inheritance fails, the 
following principles derived from our 
design criteria serve to predict the 
structural assignments of a phrasal 
category: default inheritance, sisters only, 
and left most. 
3.3.1. Default Inheritance 
This principle deals primarily and 
most effectively with coordinations and 
conjunctions. The theoretical motivation 
of this account follows Sag et al's (1985) 
proposal. In essence, the category of a 
conjunctive construction must be 
inherited from its semantic heads. 
However, since conjunctions are not 
restricted to same categories, languages 
must have principled ways to determine 
the categorical identity when different 
semantic heads carry different 
information. 
First, in the trivial case when all 
head daughters are of the same category, 
the mother will inherit hat category. 
Second, when the different head 
daughters are an elaboration of the same 
basic category (e.g. both Nd and Ne are 
elaboration of N), then the basic 
category is the default inheritance 
category for the mother. This can be 
illustrated by (3).

Third," 
mechanisms 
categorical 
and round 
when other inheritance 
fail to provide a clear 
choice, the default 
inheritance is activated. There are two 
default hierarchies. The first one deals 
with when the head daughters are all 
lexical categories (4a), and the second 
one deals with when they are all phrasal 
categories (4b). If there is a disparity 
between lexical and phrasal categories, 
then a lexical category will be expanded 
to a phrasal category first. 
(4)Default Inheritance Hierarchy for 
Categories 
a) Lexical Categories: V > N > P > Ng 
b) Phrasal Categories: S> VP> NP> 
PP> GP 
When phrasal conjuncts are involved, S 
is the privileged category since it is the 
start symbol of the grammar. VP comes 
next since its structural composition is
identical to that of S. If the structure 
involved is not a predicate (i.e. head of a 
sentence), then it must be a role. For 
argument roles, NP's are more 
privileged than PP's, and PP's are more 
privileged than GP's. (5) is an instance 
of the application of this default 
hierarchy. 
(5) \[\[da41iang4\]Neqa \[ r2\]Caa 
\[feng l sheng4\]VH11 \]V\]VP 
big-quantity and 
bountiful 
"bountiful and of big quantity" 
When lexical conjuncts are involved, the 
same principle is used. The priority is 
given to the predicate head of the 
sentence. Among possible argument 
roles, the nominal category is the default. 
An illustrative xample can be found in 
(6). 
(6) \[\[wei4lan2 de tianlkongl\]NP 
\[yu3\]Caa\[zhul qun2biao l han4\]S\]S 
aqua-blue DE sky 
and people ferocious 
'That the sky being aqua blue and 
that he people being ferocious...' 
3.3.2 Sisters Only 
Following most current linguistic 
theory, argument roles and adjunct 
complements must be sisters of a lexieal 
head. However, driven by our design 
criteria of minimal structural complexity, 
no same level iteration is allowed. Thus 
these arguments and adjuncts can be 
located by the straightforward definition 
of sisterhood: that they share the same 
mother-daughter r lation with the head. 
The result is a flat structure. 
33.3 Left First 
This principle is designed to 
account for possible internal structure 
when there are more than two sisters 
-without having to add on hierarchical 
complexity. Hence, the default 
interpretation of internal structure of 
multiple sisters is that the internal 
association starts from leR to right. 
33 
4. Annotation Guidelines II: 
Structural Annotation of 
Thematic Information 
A thematic relation contains a 
compact bundle of syntactic and 
semantic information. Although 
thematic relations are lexically encoded 
on a predicate, they can only be 
instantiated when that information is 
projected to phrasal arguments. In other 
words, the only empirical evidence for 
the existence of a thematic relation is a 
realized argument. However, a realized 
argument cannot by itself determine the 
thematic relation. The exact nature of 
the relation must be determined based 
on the lexical information fi'om the 
predicate as well as checking of the 
compatibility of that realized argument. 
Since structural information alone 
cannot determine thematic relations, 
prototypical structural annotation, such 
as in the original Penn Treebank, does 
not include thematic roles since they 
contain on-structural information. 
On the other hand, in theories 
where lexical heads drive the structural 
derivation / construction (e.g. ICG and 
HPSG and LFG), thematic relations are 
critical. Hence, we decided to encode 
realized thematic relations on each 
phrasal argument. The list of  thematic 
relations encoded on the head predicate 
is consulted whenever a phrasal 
argument is constructed, and a 
contextually appropriate relation 
sanctioned by the lexical information is 
encoded. It is worth noting that in our 
account., we not only mark the thematic 
relations of a verbal predicate, but we 
also mark the thematic relations 
governed by a deverbal noun, among 
others. Also note that an argument of a 
preposition is marked as a placeholder 
DUMMY. This is because a preposition 
only governs an argument syntactically, 
while its thematic relation is determined 
by a higher verb.

5. Current  Status of  the Sinica 
Treebank and On- l ine 
Interface 
Following the above criteria and 
principles, we have already f inished 
Sinica Treebank 1.0. It contains 
annotations of 38,725 Chinese structural 
trees containing 239,532 words. It 
covers ubject areas that include politics, 
traveling, sports, finance, society, etc. 
This version of the Sinica Treebank will 
be released in the near future as soon as 
the licensing documents are cleared by 
the legal dep~,ent  of  Academia Sinica. 
A small subset of  it (1,000 sentences) is
already available for researchers to 
download from the website 
http ://godel.i is.sinica, edu. tw/CKIP/ 
treeslOOO.htm. A searchable interface is 
also being developed and tested for 
researchers o that they can directly 
access the complete treebank 
information. 
As an annotated corpus, one of the 
most important roles that a treebank can 
play is that it can serve as a shared 
35 
source of data for linguistic, especially 
syntactic studies. Following the example 
of the successful Sinica Corpus, we have 
developed an on-line interface for 
extraction of grammatical information 
from the Sinica Treebank. Although the 
users that we have in mind are 
theoretical linguists who do not 
necessarily have computational 
background; we hope that non-linguists 
can also benefit from the ready 
availability of such grammatical 
information. And of course, 
computational linguists should be able 
to use this interface for quick references 
before going into a more in-depth study 
of the annotated corpus. 
Currently, the beta site allows users 
specify a variety of conditions to search 
for structurally annotated sentences. 
Conditions can be specified in terms of 
keywords, grammatical tags (lexical or 
phrasal), thematic relations, or any 
boolean combination of the above 
elements. The search result can be 
presented aseither annotated structure or 
simply the example sentences. Simply 
statistics, based on either straightforward 
frequency count or mutual information, 
are also available. For linguistically 
interesting information, such as the 
heads of various phrasal constructions, a 
user can simply look up the explicitly 
syntactic Head or semantic head; as 
well as DUMMY when it serves as a 
head placeholder. The website of this 
interface, as well as the general release 
of the Sinica Treebank 1.0, is scheduled 
to be announced at the second ACL 
workshop on Chinese Language 
Processing inOctober 2000. 
6. Conclusion 
The construction of the Sinica 
Treebank is only a first step towards 
application of structurally annotated 
corpora. Continuing expansion and 
correction will make this database an 
invaluable resource for linguistic and 
computational studies of Chinese.
