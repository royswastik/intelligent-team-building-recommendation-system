Abstract
Our system for the CoNLL 2008 shared
task uses a set of individual parsers, a set of
stand-alone semantic role labellers, and a
joint system for parsing and semantic role
labelling, all blended together. The system
achieved a macro averaged labelled F
1
-
score of 79.79 (WSJ 80.92, Brown 70.49)
for the overall task. The labelled attach-
ment score for syntactic dependencies was
86.63 (WSJ 87.36, Brown 80.77) and the
labelled F
1
-score for semantic dependen-
cies was 72.94 (WSJ 74.47, Brown 60.18).
1 Introduction
This paper presents a system for the CoNLL 2008
shared task on joint learning of syntactic and se-
mantic dependencies (Surdeanu et al, 2008), com-
bining a two-step pipelined approach with a joint
approach.
In the pipelined system, eight different syntac-
tic parses were blended, yielding the input for two
variants of a semantic role labelling (SRL) system.
Furthermore, one of the syntactic parses was used
with an early version of the SRL system, to pro-
vide predicate predictions for a joint syntactic and
semantic parser. For the final submission, all nine
syntactic parses and all three semantic parses were
blended.
The system is outlined in Figure 1; the dashed

2 Dependency Parsing
The initial parsing system was created using Malt-
Parser (Nivre et al, 2007) by blending eight dif-
ferent parsers. To further advance the syntactic ac-
curacy, we added the syntactic structure predicted
by a joint system for syntactic and semantic depen-
dencies (see Section 3.4) in the blending process.
2.1 Parsers
The MaltParser is a dependency parser genera-
tor, with three parsing algorithms: Nivre?s arc
standard, Nivre?s arc eager (see Nivre (2004)
for a comparison between the two Nivre algo-
rithms), and Covington?s (Covington, 2001). Both
of Nivre?s algorithms assume projectivity, but
the MaltParser supports pseudo-projective parsing
(Nilsson et al, 2007), for projectivization and de-
projectivization.

sets of the best single parse, blended with weights
set to PoS labelled attachment score (LAS) and

Four parsing algorithms (the two Nivre al-
gorithms, and Covington?s projective and non-
projective version) were used, creating eight
parsers by varying the parsing direction, left-to-
right and right-to-left. The latter was achieved by
reversing the word order in a pre-processing step
and then restoring it in post-processing. For the fi-
nal system, feature models and training parameters
were adapted from Hall et al (2007).
2.2 Blender
The single parses were blended following the pro-
cedure of Hall et al (2007). The parses of each
sentence were combined into a weighted directed
graph. The Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm (Chu and
Liu, 1965; Edmonds, 1967) was then used to find
the maximum spanning tree (MST) of the graph,
which was considered the final parse of the sen-
tence. The weight of each graph edge was calcu-
lated as the sum of the weights of the correspond-
ing edges in each single parse tree.
We used a simple iterative weight updating algo-
rithm to learn the individual weights of each single
parser output and part-of-speech (PoS) using the
development set. To construct an initial MST, the
labelled attachment score was used. Each single
weight, corresponding to an edge of the hypoth-
esis tree, was then iteratively updated by slightly
increasing or decreasing the weight, depending on
whether it belonged to a correct or incorrect edge
as compared to the reference tree.
2.3 Results
The results are summarized in Table 1; the parse
with LAS weights and the best single parse
(Nivre?s arc eager algorithm with left-to-right pars-
ing direction) are also included for comparison.
3 Semantic Role Labelling
The SRL system is a pipeline with three chained
stages: predicate identification, argument identifi-
cation, and argument classification. Predicate and
argument identification are treated as binary clas-
sification problems. In a simple post-processing
predicate classification step, a predicted predicate
is assigned the most frequent sense from the train-
ing data. Argument classification is treated as a
multi-class learning problem, where the classes
correspond to the argument types.
3.1 Learning and Parameter Optimization
For learning and prediction we used the freely
available support vector machine (SVM) imple-
mentation LIBSVM (version 2.86) (Chang and
Lin, 2001). The choice of cost and kernel parame-
ter values will often significantly influence the per-
formance of the SVM classifier. We therefore im-
plemented a parameter optimizer based on the DI-
RECT optimization algorithm (Gablonsky, 2001).
It iteratively divides the search space into smaller
hyperrectangles, sampling the objective function
in the centroid of each hyperrectangle, and select-
ing those hyperrectangles that are potentially opti-
mal for further processing. The search space con-
sisted of the SVM parameters to optimize and the
objective function was the cross-validation accu-
racy reported by LIBSVM.
Tests performed during training for predicate
identification showed that the use of runtime opti-
mization of the SVM parameters for nonlinear ker-
nels yielded a higher average F
1
-score effective-
ness. Surprisingly, the best nonlinear kernels were
always outperformed by the linear kernel with de-
fault settings, which indicates that the data is ap-
proximately linearly separable.
3.2 Filtering and Data Set Splitting
To decrease the number of instances during train-
ing, all predicate and argument candidates with
PoS-tags that occur very infrequently in the
training set were filtered out. Some PoS-tags
were filtered out for all three stages, e.g. non-
alphanumerics, HYPH, SYM, and LS. This ap-
proach was effective, e.g. removing more than half
of the total number of instances for predicate pre-
diction.
To speed up the SVM training and allow for
parallelization, each data set was split into several
bins. However, there is a trade-off between speed
and accuracy. Performance consistently deterio-
rated when splitting into smaller bins. The final
system contained two variants, one with more bins
based on a combination of PoS-tags and lemma
frequency information, and one with fewer bins
249
based only on PoS-tag information. The three
learning tasks used different splits. In general, the
argument identification step was the most difficult
and therefore required a larger number of bins.
3.3 Features
We implemented a large number of features (over
50)
1
for the SRL system. Many of them can be
found in the literature, starting from Gildea and
Jurafsky (2002) and onward. All features, except
bag-of-words, take nominal values, which are bi-
narized for the vectors used as input to the SVM
classifier. Low-frequency feature values (except
for Voice, Initial Letter, Number of Words, Rela-
tive Position, and the Distance features), below a
threshold of 20 occurrences, were given a default
value.
We distinguish between single node and node
pair features. The following single node features
were used for all three learning tasks and for both
the predicate and argument node:
2
? Lemma, PoS, and Dependency relation (DepRel) for
the node itself, the parent, and the left and right sibling
? Initial Letter (upper-case/lower-case), Number of
Words, and Voice (based on simple heuristics, only for
the predicate node during argument classification)
? PoS Sequence and PoS bag-of-words (BoW) for the
node itself with children and for the parent with chil-
dren
? Lemma and PoS for the first and last child of the node
? Sequence and BoW of Lemma and PoS for content
words
? Sequence and BoW of PoS for the immediate children?s
content words
? Sequence and BoW of PoS for the parent?s content
words and for the parent?s immediate children
? Sequence and BoW of DepRels for the node itself, for
the immediate children, and for the parent?s immediate
children
All extractors of node pair features, where the pair
consists of the predicate and the argument node,
can be used both for argument identification and
argument classification. We used the following
node pair features:
? Relative Position (the argument is before/after the pred-
icate), Distance in Words, Middle Distance in DepRels
? PoS Full Path, PoS Middle Path, PoS Short Path
1
Some features were discarded for the final system based
on Information Gain, calculated using Weka (Witten and
Frank, 2005).
2
For all features using lemma or PoS the (predicted) split
value is used.
The full path feature contains the PoS-tag of the ar-
gument node, all dependency relations between the
argument node and the predicate node and finally
the PoS-tag of the predicate node. The middle path
goes to the lowest common ancestor for argument
and predicate (this is also the distance calculated
by Middle Distance in DepRels) and the short path
only contains the dependency relation of the argu-
ment and predicate nodes.
3.4 Joint Syntactic and Semantic Parsing
When considering one predicate at a time, SRL be-
comes a regular labelling problem. Given a pre-
dicted predicate, joint learning of syntactic and se-
mantic dependencies can be carried out by simulta-
neously assigning an argument label and a depen-
dency relation. This is possible because we know
a priori where to attach the argument, since there
is only one predicate candidate
3
. The MaltParser
system for English described in Hall et al (2007)
was used as a baseline, and then optimized for this
new task, focusing on feature selection.
A large feature model was constructed, and
backward selection was carried out until no fur-
ther gain could be observed. The feature model of
MaltParser consists of a number of feature types,
each describing a starting point, a path through the
structure so far, and a column of the node arrived
at. The number of feature types was reduced from
37 to 35 based on the labelled F
1
-score.
As parsing is done at the same time as argu-
ment labelling, different syntactic structures risk
being assigned to the same sentence, depending
on which predicate is currently processed. This
means that several, possibly different, parses have
to be combined into one. In this experiment, the
head and the dependency label were concatenated,
and the most frequent one was used. In case of
a tie, the first one to appear was used. The like-
lihood of the chosen labelling was also used as a
confidence measure for the syntactic blender.
3.5 Blending and Post-Processing
Combining the output from several different sys-
tems has been shown to be beneficial (Koomen
et al, 2005). For the final submission, we com-
bined the output of two variants of the pipelined
SRL system, each using different data splits, with
3
The version of the joint system used in the submission
was based on an early predicate prediction. More accurate
predicates would give a major improvement for the results.

the SRL output of the joint system. A simple uni-
form weight majority vote heuristic was used, with
no combinatorial constraints on the selected argu-
ments. For each sentence, all predicates that were
identified by a majority of the systems were se-
lected. Then, for each selected predicate, its ar-
guments were picked by majority vote (ignoring
the systems not voting for the predicate). The best
single SRL system achieved a labelled F
1
-score
of 71.34 on the WSJ test set and 57.73 on the
Brown test set, compared to 74.47 and 60.18 for
the blended system.
As a final step, we filtered out all verbal and
nominal predicates not in PropBank or NomBank,
respectively, based on the predicted PoS-tag and
lemma. Each lexicon was expanded with lemmas
from the training set, due to predicted lemma er-
rors in the training data. This turned out to be a
successful strategy for the individual systems, but
slightly detrimental for the blended system.
3.6 Results
Semantic predicate results for WSJ and Brown can
be found in Table 2. Table 4 shows the results for
identification and classification of arguments.
4 Analysis and Conclusions
In general, the mixed and blended system performs
well on all tasks, rendering a sixth place in the
CoNLL 2008 shared task. The overall scores for
the submitted system can be seen in Table 3.
4.1 Parsing
For the blended parsing system, the labelled at-
tachment score drops from 87.36 for the WSJ test
set to 80.77 for the Brown test set, while the unla-
belled attachment score only drops from 89.88 to
86.28. This shows that the system is robust with
regards to the overall syntactic structure, even if
picking the correct label is more difficult for the
out-of-domain text.
The parser has difficulties finding the right head
for punctuation and symbols. Apart from errors re-

garding punctuation, most errors occur for IN and
TO. A majority of these problems are related to as-
signing the correct dependency. This is not surpris-
ing, since these are categories that focus on form
rather than function.
There is no significant difference in score for left
and right dependencies, presumably because of the
bi-directional parsing. However, the system over-
predicts dependencies to the root. This is mainly
due to the way MaltParser handles tokens not be-
ing attached anywhere during parsing. These to-
kens are by default assigned to the root.
4.2 SRL
Similarly to the parsing results, the blended SRL
system is less robust with respect to labelled F
1
-
score, dropping from 74.47 on the WSJ test set to
60.18 on the Brown test set. The corresponding
drop in unlabelled F
1
-score is from 82.90 to 75.49.
The simple method of picking the most com-
mon sense from the training data works quite well,
but the difference in domain makes it more diffi-
cult to find the correct sense for the Brown corpus.
In the future, a predicate classification module is
needed. For the WSJ corpus, assigning the most
common predicate sense works better with nomi-
nal than with verbal predicates, while verbal pred-
icates are handled better for the Brown corpus.
In general, verbal predicate-argument structures
are handled better than nominal ones, for both
test sets. This is not surprising, since nominal
predicate-argument structures tend to vary more in
their composition.
Since we do not use global constraints for the
argument labelling (looking at the whole argument
structure for each predicate), the system can out-
put the same argument label for a predicate several
times. For the WSJ test set, for instance, the ra-
tio of repeated argument labels is 5.4% in the sys-
tem output, compared to 0.3% in the gold standard.
However, since there are no confidence scores for
predictions it is difficult to handle this in the cur-
rent system.
