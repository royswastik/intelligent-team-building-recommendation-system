Abstract
This paper presents a method for seman-
tic classi?cation of onomatopoetic words
like ??????? (hum)? and ????
??? (clip clop)? which exist in ev-
ery language, especially Japanese being
rich in onomatopoetic words. We used
a graph-based clustering algorithm called
Newman clustering. The algorithm cal-
culates a simple quality function to test
whether a particular division is meaning-
ful. The quality function is calculated
based on the weights of edges between
nodes. We combined two different sim-
ilarity measures, distributional similarity,
and orthographic similarity to calculate
weights. The results obtained by using
the Web data showed a 9.0% improvement
over the baseline single distributional sim-
ilarity measure.
1 Introduction
Onomatopoeia which we call onomatopoetic word
(ono word) is the formation of words whose sound
is imitative of the sound of the noise or action des-
ignated, such as ?hiss? (McLeod, 1991). It is one
of the linguistic features of Japanese. Consider two
sentences from Japanese.
(1) ????????????????????
??????
?I?m too sleepy because I awoke to the slip-
pers in the hall.?

(2) ???????????????????
?????????????
?I?m too sleepy because I awoke to the pit-a-
pat of slippers in the hall.?
Sentences (1) and (2) are almost the same sense.
However, sentence (2) which includes ono word,
????? (pit-a-pat)? is much better to make
the scene alive, or represents an image clearly.
Therefore large-scale semantic resource of ono
words is indispensable for not only NLP, but
also many semantic-oriented applications such as
Question Answering, Paraphrasing, and MT sys-
tems. Although several machine-readable dictio-
naries which are ?ne-grained and large-scale se-
mantic knowledge like WordNet, COMLEX, and
EDR dictionary exist, there are none or few ono-
matopoetic thesaurus. Because (i) it is easy to un-
derstand its sense of ono word for Japanese, and
(ii) it is a fast-changing linguistic expressions, as
it is a vogue word. Therefore, considering this re-
source scarcity problem, semantic classi?cation of
ono words which do not appear in the resource but
appear in corpora is very important.
In this paper, we focus on Japanese onomatopo-
etic words, and propose a method for classifying
them into a set with similar meaning. We used
the Web as a corpus to collect ono words, as they
appear in different genres of dialogues including
broadcast news, novels and comics, rather than a
well-edited, balanced corpus like newspaper arti-
cles. The problem using a large, heterogeneous
collection of Web data is that the Web counts are
far more noisy than counts obtained from textual
corpus. We thus used a graph-based clustering al-
gorithm, called Newman clustering for classify-
ing ono words. The algorithm does not simply cal-
culate the number of shortest paths between pairs
of nodes, but instead calculates a quality function
33
of how good a cluster structure found by an algo-
rithm is, and thus makes the computation far more
ef?cient. The ef?cacy of the algorithm depends
on a quality function which is calculated by us-
ing the weights of edges between nodes. We com-
bined two different similarity measures, and used
them to calculate weights. One is co-occurrence
based distributional similarity measure. We tested
mutual information (MI) and a ?2 statistic as a
similarity measure. Another is orthographic sim-
ilarity which is based on a feature of ono words
called ?sound symbolism?. Sound symbolism in-
dicates that phonemes or phonetic sequences ex-
press their senses. As ono words imitate the sounds
associated with the objects or actions they refer to,
their phonetic sequences provide semantic clues
for classi?cation. The empirical results are encour-
aging, and showed a 9.0% improvement over the
baseline single distributional similarity measure.
2 Previous Work
There are quite a lot of work on semantic classi?-
cation of words with corpus-based approach. The
earliest work in this direction are those of (Hindle,
1990), (Lin, 1998), (Dagan et al, 1999), (Chen
and Chen, 2000), (Geffet and Dagan, 2004) and
(Weeds and Weir, 2005). They used distributional
similarity. Similarity measures based on distribu-
tional hypothesis compare a pair of weighted fea-
ture vectors that characterize two words. Features
typically correspond to other words that co-occur
with the characterized word in the same context.
Lin (1998) proposed a word similarity measure
based on the distributional pattern of words which
allows to construct a thesaurus using a parsed cor-
pus. He compared the result of automatically cre-
ated thesaurus with WordNet and Roget, and re-
ported that the result was signi?cantly closer to
WordNet than Roget Thesaurus was.
Graph representations for word similarity have
also been proposed by several researchers (Jan-
nink and Wiederhold, 1999; Galley and McKeown,
2003; Muller et al, 2006). Sinha and Mihalcea
(2007) proposed a graph-based algorithm for un-
supervised word sense disambiguation which com-
bines several semantic similarity measures includ-
ing Resnik?s metric (Resnik, 1995), and algorithms
for graph centrality. They reported that the results
using the SENSEVAL-2 and SENSEVAL-3 En-
glish all-words data sets lead to relative error rate
reductions of 5 ? 8% as compared to the previous
work (Mihalcea, 2005).
In the context of graph-based clustering of
words, Widdows and Dorow (2002) used a graph
model for unsupervised lexical acquisition. The
graph structure is built by linking pairs of words
which participate in particular syntactic relation-
ships. An incremental cluster-building algorithm
using the graph structure achieved 82% accuracy at
a lexical acquisition task, evaluated against Word-
Net 10 classes, and each class consists of 20 words.
Matsuo et al (2006) proposed a method of word
clustering based on a word similarity measure by
Web counts. They used Newman clustering for
clustering algorithm. They evaluated their method
using two sets of word classes. One is derived from
the Web data, and another is from WordNet.1 Each
set consists of 90 noun words. They reported that
the results obtained by Newman clustering were
better than those obtained by average-link agglom-
erative clustering. Our work is similar to their
method in the use of Newman clustering. How-
ever, they classi?ed Japanese noun words, while
our work is the ?rst to aim at detecting seman-
tic classi?cation of onomatopoetic words. More-
over, they used only a single similarity metric, co-
occurrence based similarity, while Japanese, espe-
cially ?kanji? characters of noun words provide se-
mantic clues for classifying words.
3 System Description
The method consists of three steps: retrieving co-
occurrences using the Web, calculating similarity
between ono words, and classifying ono words by
using Newman clustering.
3.1 Retrieving Co-occurrence using the Web
One criterion for calculating semantic similarity
between ono words is co-occurrence based similar-
ity. We retrieved frequency of two ono words oc-
curring together by using the Web search engine,
Google. The similarity between them is calcu-
lated based on their co-occurrence frequency. Like
much previous work on semantic classi?cation of
the lexicons, our assumption is that semantically
similar words appear in similar contexts. A lot
of strategies for searching words are provided in
Google. Of these we focused on two methods:
Boolean search AND and phrase-based search.
1They used WordNet hypernym information. It consists
of 10 classes. They assigned 90 Japanese noun words to each
class.
34
When we use AND boolean search, i.e., (Oi Oj)
where Oi and Oj are ono words, we can retrieve
the number of documents which include both Oi
and Oj . In contrast, phrase-based search, i.e.,
(?Oi Oj?) retrieves documents which include two
adjacent words Oi and Oj .
3.2 Similarity Measures
The second step is to calculate semantic similarity
between ono words. We combined two different
similarity measures: the co-occurrence frequency
based similarity and orthographic similarity mea-
sures.
3.2.1 Co-occurrence based Similarity
Measure
We focused on two popular measures: the mu-
tual information (MI) and ?2 statistics.
1. Mutual Information
Church and Hanks (1990) discussed the use
of the mutual information statistics as a way
to identify a variety of interesting linguistic
phenomena, ranging from semantic relations
of the doctor/nurse type (content word/content
word) to lexico-syntactic co-occurrence prefer-
ences between verbs and prepositions (content
word/function word). Let Oi and Oj be ono words
retrieved from the Web. The mutual information
MI(Oi, Oj) is de?ned as:
MI(Oi, Oj) = log
Sall ? f(Oi, Oj)
SOi ? SOj
, (1)
where SOi =
?
k?Oall
f(Oi, Ok), (2)
Sall =
?
Oi?Oall
SOi . (3)
In Eq. (1), f(Oi, Oj) refers to the frequency of Oi
and Oj occurring together, and Oall is a set of all
ono words retrieved from the Web.
2. ?2 statistic
The ?2(Oi, Oj) is de?ned as:
?2(Oi, Oj) =
f(Oi, Oj)? E(Oi, Oj)
E(Oi, Oj)
, (4)
where E(Oi, Oj) = SOi ?
SOj
Sall
. (5)
SOi and Sall in Eq. (5) refer to Eq. (2) and (3),
respectively. A major difference between ?2 and
MI is that the former is a normalized value.
3.2.2 Orthographic Similarity Measure
Orthographic similarity has been widely used
in spell checking and speech recognition systems
(Damerau, 1964). Our orthographic similarity
measure is based on a unit of phonetic sequence.
The key steps of the similarity between two ono
words is de?ned as:
1. Convert each ono word into phonetic se-
quences.
The ?hiragana? characters of ono word are
converted into phonetic sequences by a
unique rule. Basically, there are 19 conso-
nants and 5 vowels, as listed in Table 1.
Table 1: Japanese consonants and vowels
Consonant ?, N, Q, h, hy, k, ky, m, my, n,
ny, r, ry, s, sy, t, ty, w, y
Vowel a, i, u, e, o
Consider phonetic sequences ?hyu-hyu-? of
ono word ???????? (hum). It is seg-
mented into 4 consonants ?hy?, ?-?, ?hy? and
?-?, and two vowels, ?u? and ?u?.
2. Form a vector in n-dimensional space.
Each ono word is represented as a vector
of consonants(vowels), where each dimen-
sion of the vector corresponds to each con-
sonant and vowel, and each value of the di-
mension is frequencies of its corresponding
consonant(vowel).
3. Calculate orthographic similarity.
The orthographic similarity between ono
words, Oi and Oj is calculated based on the
consonant and vowel distributions. We used
two popular measures, i.e., the cosine similar-
ity, and ?-skew divergence. The cosine mea-
sures the similarity of the two vectors by cal-
culating the cosine of the angle between vec-
tors. ?-skew divergence is de?ned as:
?div(x, y) = D(y || ? ? x + (1? ?) ? y),
where D(x||y) refers to Kullback-Leibler
and de?ned as:
D(x||y) =
n?
i=1
xi ? log
xi
yi
. (6)
35
Lee (1999) reported the best results with ?
= 0.9. We used the same value. We de?ned a
similarity metric by combining co-occurrence
based and orthographic similarity measures2:
Sim(Oi, Oj) =
MI(Oi, Oj)? (Cos(Oi, Oj) + 1) (7)
3.3 The Newman Clustering Algorithm
We classi?ed ono words collected from the WWW.
Therefore, the clustering algorithm should be ef?-
cient and effective even in the very high dimen-
sional spaces. For this purpose, we chose a graph-
based clustering algorithm, called Newman clus-
tering. The Newman clustering is a hierarchical
clustering algorithm which is based on Network
structure (Newman, 2004). The network structure
consists of nodes within which the node-node con-
nections are edges. It produces some division of
the nodes into communities, regardless of whether
the network structure has any natural such divi-
sion. Here, ?community? or ?cluster? have in com-
mon that they are groups of densely interconnected
nodes that are only sparsely connected with the rest
of the network. To test whether a particular divi-
sion is meaningful a quality function Q is de?ned:
Q =
?
i
(eii ? a
2
i )
where eij is the sum of the weight of edges be-
tween two communities i and j divided by the sum
of the weight of all edges, and ai =
?
j eij , i.e., the
expected fraction of edges within the cluster. Here
are the key steps of that algorithm:
1. Given a set of n ono words S = {O1, ? ? ?,
On}. Create a network structure which con-
sists of nodes O1, ? ? ?, On, and edges. Here,
the weight of an edge between Oi and Oj
is a similarity value obtained by Eq. (7). If
the ?network density? of ono words is smaller
than the parameter ?, we cut the edge. Here,
?network density? refers to a ratio selected
from the topmost edges. For example, if it
2When we used ?2 statistic as a co-occurrence based sim-
ilarity, MI in Eq. (7) is replaced by ?2. In a similar way,
Cos(Oi, Oj) is replaced by max? ?div(x, y), where max
is the maximum value among all ?div(x, y) values.
was 0.9, we used the topmost 90% of all
edges and cut the remains, where edges are
sorted in the descending order of their simi-
larity values.
2. Starting with a state in which each ono word
is the sole member of one of n communities,
we repeatedly joined communities together in
pairs, choosing at each step the join that re-
sults in the greatest increase.
3. Suppose that two communities are merged
into one by a join operation. The change in
Q upon joining two communities i and j is
given by:
%Qij = eij + eji ? 2aiaj
= 2(eij ? aiaj)
4. Apply step 3. to every pair of communities.
5. Join two communities such that"Q is maxi-
mum and create one community. If"Q < 0,
go to step 7.
6. Re-calculate eij and ai of the joined commu-
nity, and go to step 3.
7. Words within the same community are re-
garded as semantically similar.
The computational cost of the algorithm is known
as O((m + n)n) or O(n2), where m and n are the
number of edges and nodes, respectively.
4 Experiments
4.1 Experimental Setup
The data for the classi?cation of ono words have
been taken from the Japanese ono dictionary (Ono,
2007) that consisted of 4,500 words. Of these, we
selected 273 words, which occurred at least 5,000
in the document URLs from the WWW. The min-
imum frequency of a word was found to be 5,220,
while the maximum was about 26 million. These
words are classi?ed into 10 classes. Word classes
and examples of ono words from the dictionary are
listed in Table 2.
?Id? denotes id number of each class. ?Sense?
refers to each sense of ono word within the same
class, and ?Num? is the number of words which
should be assigned to each class. Each word

Total 273
marked with bracket denotes phonetic sequences
consisting of consonants and vowels.
We retrieved co-occurrences of ono words
shown in Table 2 using the search engine, Google.
We applied Newman clustering to the input words.
For comparison, we implemented standard k-
means which is often used as a baseline, as it is
one of the simplest unsupervised clustering algo-
rithms, and compared the results to those obtained
by our method. We used Euclidean distance (L2
norm) as a distance metric used in the k-means.
For evaluation of classi?cation, we used
Precision(Prec), Recall(Rec), and F -measure
which is a measure that balances precision and re-
call (Bilenko et al, 2004). The precise de?nitions
of these measures are given below:
Prec =
#PairsCorrectlyPredictedInSamecluster
#TotalPairsPredictedInSameCluster
(8)
Rec =
#PairsCorrectlyPredictedInSameCluster
#TotalPairsInSameCluster
(9)
F ?measure =

(Prec + Rec)

4.2 Results
The results are shown in Table 3. ?Co-occ. &
Sounds? in Data refers to the results obtained by
our method. ?Co-occ.? denotes the results ob-
tained by a single measure, co-occurrence based
distributional similarity measure, and ?Sounds?
shows the results obtained by orthographic sim-
ilarity. ??? in Table 3 shows a parameter ?
used in the Newman clustering.3 Table 3 shows
best performance of each method against ? val-
ues. The best result was obtained when we used
phrase-based search and a combined measure of
co-occurrence(MI) and sounds (cos), and F -score
was 0.451.
4.2.1 AND vs phrase-based search
Table 3 shows that overall the results using
phrase-based search were better than those of
AND search, and the maximum difference of F -
score between them was 20.6% when we used a
combined measure. We note that AND boolean
search did not consider the position of a word in
a document, while our assumption was that se-
mantically similar words appeared in similar con-
texts. As a result, two ono words which were
not semantically similar were often retrieved by
AND boolean search. For example, consider two
antonymous words, ?a,h,a,h,a? (grinning broadly)
and ?w,a,?,N? (Wah, Wah). The co-occurrence fre-
quency obtained by AND was 5,640, while that of
phrase-based search was only one. The observa-
tion shows that we ?nd phrase-based search to be
a good choice.
3In case of k-means, we used the weights which satis?es
network density.

To examine the effectiveness of the combined
similarity measure, we used a single measure as
a quality function of the Newman clustering, and
compared these results with those obtained by our
method. As shown in Table 3, the results with
combining similarity measures improved overall
performance. In the phrase-based search, for ex-
ample, the F-score using a combined measure ?Co-
occ(MI) & Sounds(cos)? was 23.8% better than
the baseline single measure ?Sounds(cos)?, and
9.0% better a single measure ?Co-occ(MI)?.
Figure 1 shows F-score by ?Co-occ(MI) &
Sounds(cos)? and ?Co-occ(MI)? against changes
in ?. These curves were obtained by phrase-
based search. We can see from Figure 1 that the
F-score by a combined measure ?Co-occ(MI) &
Sounds(cos)? was better than ?Co-occ(MI)? with
? value ranged from .001 to .25. One possible rea-
son for the difference of F-score between them is
the edges selected by varying ?. Figure 2 shows
the results obtained by each single measure, and a
combined measure to examine how the edges se-
lected by varying ? affect overall performance, F-
measure. ?Precision? in Figure 2 refers to the ratio
of correct ono word pairs (edges) divided by the to-
tal number of edges. Here, correct ono word pairs
were created by using the Japanese ono dictionary,
i.e., we extracted word pairs within the same sense
of the dictionary. Surprisingly, there were no sig-
ni?cant difference between a combined measure
?Co-occ(MI) & Sounds(cos)? and a single mea-
sure ?Co-occ(MI)? curves, while the precision of
a single measure ?Sounds? was constantly worse
than that obtained by a combined measure. An-
other possible reason for the difference of F-score
is due to product of MI and Cos in Eq. (7). Fur-
ther work is needed to analyze these results in de-
tail.

We examined the results obtained by standard k-
means and Newman clustering algorithms. As can
be seen clearly from Table 3, the results with New-
man clustering were better than those of the stan-
dard k-means at all search and similarity measures,
especially the result obtained by Newman clus-
tering showed a 16.2 % improvement over the k-
means when we used Co-occ.(MI) & Sounds(cos)
& phrase-based search. We recall that we used
273 ono words for clustering. However, Newman
clustering is applicable for a large number of nodes
and edges without decreasing accuracy too much,
as it does not simply calculate the number of short-

4.3 Qualitative Analysis of Errors
Finally, to provide feedback for further devel-
opment of our classi?cation approach, we per-
formed a qualitative analysis of errors. Con-
sider the following clusters (the Newman output
for Co-occ.(MI), Sounds(cos) and phrase-based
search), where each parenthetic sequences denotes
ono word:
A1: (t,o,Q) (t,o,Q,t,o) (t,o,Q,k,i,N,t,o,Q,k,i,N)
A2: (o,h,o,h,o), (e,h,e,h,e), (h,e,h,e,h,e), (o,-,o,-)
A3: (u,s,i,u,s,i), (m,o,s,i,m,o,s,i), (m,o,s,o,m,o,s,o)
Three main error types were identi?ed:
1. Morphological idiosyncrasy: This was
the most frequent error type, exempli?ed
in A1, where ?(t,o,Q,k,i,N,t,o,Q,k,i,N)?
(pain sense) was incorrectly clustered with
other two words (laugh sense) merely be-
cause orthographic similarity between them
was large, as the phonetics sequences of
?(t,o,Q,k,i,N,t,o,Q,k,i,N)? included ?t? and
?o?.
2. Sparse data: Many of the low frequency ono
words performed poorly. In A2, ?(o,-,o,-)?
(cry sense) was classi?ed with other three
words (laugh sense) because it occurred few
in our data.
3. Problems of polysemy: In A3,
?(m,o,s,o,m,o,s,o)? (pain sense) was
clustered with other two words (balk sense)
of its gold standard class. However, the ono
word has another sense, balk sense when it
co-occurred with action verbs.
5 Conclusion
We have focused on onomatopoetic words, and
proposed a method for classifying them into a set
of semantically similar words. We used a graph-
based clustering algorithm, called Newman clus-
tering with a combined different similarity mea-
sures. The results obtained by using the Web
data showed a 9.0% improvement over the base-
line single distributional similarity measure. There
are number of interesting directions for future re-
search.
The distributional similarity measure we used
is the basis of the ono words, while other content
words such as verbs and adverbs are also effective
for classifying ono words. In the future, we plan to
investigate the use of these words and work on im-
proving the accuracy of classi?cation. As shown
in Table 2, many of the ono words consist of du-
plicative character sequences such as ?h? and ?a?
of ?a,h,a,h,a?, and ?h? and ?i? of ?i,h,i,h,i?. More-
over, characters which consist of ono words within
the same class match. For example, the hiragana
character ??? (h,a) frequently appears in laugh
sense class. These observations indicate that in-
tegrating edit-distance and our current similarity
measure will improve overall performance.
Another interesting direction is a problem of
polysemy. It clearly supports the classi?cation
of (Ono, 2007) to insist that some ono words
belong to more than one cluster. For example,
?(i,s,o,i,s,o)? has at least two senses, panic and feel
delight sense. In order to accommodate this, we
39
should apply an appropriate soft clustering tech-
nique (Tishby et al, 1999; Reichardt and Born-
holdt, 2006; Zhang et al, 2007).
