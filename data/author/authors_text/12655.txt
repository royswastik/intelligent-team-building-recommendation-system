Abstract
We demonstrate an open-source natural
language generation engine that produces
descriptions of entities and classes in En-
glish and Greek from OWL ontologies that
have been annotated with linguistic and
user modeling information expressed in
RDF. We also demonstrate an accompany-
ing plug-in for the Prote?ge? ontology editor,
which can be used to create the ontology?s
annotations and generate previews of the
resulting texts by invoking the generation
engine. The engine has been embedded in
robots acting as museum tour guides in the
physical world and in Second Life; here
we demonstrate the latter application.
1 Introduction
NaturalOWL (Galanis and Androutsopoulos, 2007;
Androutsopoulos and Galanis, 2008) is a natu-
ral language generation engine that produces de-
scriptions of entitities (e.g., items for sale, mu-
seum exhibits) and classes (e.g., types of exhibits)
in English and Greek from OWL DL ontologies;
the ontologies must have been annotated with lin-
guistic and user modeling annotations expressed
in RDF.1 An accompanying plug-in for the well
known Prote?ge? ontology editor is available, which
can be used to create the linguistic and user model-
ing annotations while editing an ontology, as well
as to generate previews of the resulting texts by
invoking the generation engine.2
NaturalOWL is based on ideas from ILEX
(O?Donnell et al, 2001) and M-PIRO (Isard et al,
2003; Androutsopoulos et al, 2007), but it uses

now called ELEON (Bilidas et al, 2007), can also be used; see

templates instead of systemic grammars, it is pub-
licly available as open-source software, it is writ-
ten entirely in Java, and it provides native support
for OWL ontologies, making it particularly useful
for Semantic Web applications (Antoniou and van
Harmelen, 2004).3 Well known advantages of nat-
ural language generation (Reiter and Dale, 2000)
include the ability to generate texts in multiple lan-
guages from the same ontology; and the ability to
tailor the semantic content and language expres-
sions of the texts to the user type (e.g., child vs.
adult) and the interaction history (e.g., by avoiding
repetitions, or by comparing to previous objects).
In project XENIOS (Vogiatzis et al, 2008), Nat-
uralOWL was embedded in a mobile robot acting
as a museum guide, and in project INDIGO it is
being integrated in a more advanced robotic guide
that includes a multimodal dialogue manager, fa-
cial animation, and mechanisms to recognize and
express emotions (Konstantopoulos et al, 2009).
Here, we demonstrate a similar application, where
NaturalOWL is embedded in a robotic avatar acting

cense (GPL). The software can be downloaded from

as a museum guide in Second Life (Oberlander et
al., 2008), as shown in figure 1. We also demon-
strate how the underlying ontology of the museum
and its linguistic and user modeling annotations
can be edited in Prote?ge?.
2 NaturalOWL?s architecture
NaturalOWL adopts a typical natural language
generation pipeline (Reiter and Dale, 2000). It
produces texts in three stages: document planning,
microplanning, and surface realization.
In document planning, the system first selects
from the ontology the logical facts (OWL triples)
that will be conveyed to the user, taking into ac-
count interest scores manually assigned to the
facts via the annotations of the ontology, as well
as a dynamcally updated user model that shows
what information has already been conveyed to the
user. Logical facts that report similarities or differ-
ences to previously encountered entities may also
be included in the output of content selection, giv-
ing rise to comparisons like the one in figure 1.
The selected facts are then ordered using a man-
ually specified partial order, which is also part of
the ontology?s annotations.
In micro-planning, the system turns each se-
lected fact into a sentence by using micro-plans, in
effect patterns that leave referring expressions un-
derspecified. Figure 2 shows a micro-plan being
edited with NaturalOWL?s Prote?ge? plug-in. The
micro-plan specifies that to express a fact that in-
volves the made-of property, the system should
concatenate an automatically generated referring
expression (e.g., name, pronoun, definite noun
phrase) in nominative case for the owner of the
fact (semantic subject of the triple), the verb form
?is made? (or ?are made?, if the subject is in plu-
ral), the preposition ?of?, and then another au-
tomatically generated referring expression in ac-
cusative case for the filler of the property (seman-
tic object). The referring expressions are gener-
ated by taking into account the context of each
sentence, attempting to avoid repetitions without
introducing ambiguities. Domain-independent ag-
gregation rules are then employed to combine the
resulting sentences into longer ones.
In surface realization, the final form of the text
is produced; it can be marked up automatically
with tags that indicate punctuation symbols, gram-
matical categories, the logical facts expressed by
the sentences, the interest (Int) of each sen-
tence?s information, the degree (Assim) to which
the information is taken to be assimilated by the
user etc., as shown below. In INDIGO, compar-
isons are also marked up with angles that guide
the robot to turn to the object(s) it compares to.

2.1 Using NaturalOWL?s Prote?ge? plug-in
NaturalOWL?s plug-in for Prote?ge? can be used to
specify all the linguistic and user modeling an-
notations of the ontologies that NaturalOWL re-
quires. The annotations in effect establish a
domain-dependent lexicon, whose entries are as-
sociated with classes or entities of the ontology;
micro-plans, which are associated with proper-
ties of the ontology; a partial order of proper-
ties, which is used in document planning; interest
scores, indicating how interesting the various facts
of the ontology are to each user type; parameters
that control, for example, the desired length of the
generated texts. The plug-in can also be used to
generate previews of the resulting texts, for differ-
ent types of users, with or without comparisons,
etc., as illustrated in figure 3. The resulting anno-
tations are then saved in RDF.
2.2 Using NaturalOWL in Second Life
In Second Life, each user controls an avatar, which
can, among other actions, move in the virtual
world, touch objects, or communicate with other

avatars; in the latter case, the user types text on the
keyboard. In the Second Life application that we
demonstrate, the robot is an avatar that is not con-
trolled by a human, but by our own Second Life
client software.4 The client software includes a
navigation component, which controls the robot?s
movement, and it allows the robot to ?utter? texts
generated by NaturalOWL, instead of expecting
keyboard input. Whenever a visitor near the robot
touches an exhibit, an appropriate event is sent to
the robot, which then goes near the exhibit and
starts describing it.5
3 Conclusions and further work
The demonstration presents an open-source nat-
ural language generation engine for OWL ontolo-
gies, which generates descriptions of entities and
classes in English and Greek. The engine is ac-
companied by a Prote?ge? plug-in, which can be
used to annotate the ontologies with linguistic and
user modeling information required by the gener-
ation engine. The demonstration includes an ap-
plication in Second Life, where the generation en-
gine is embedded in a robotic avatar acting as a
museum guide. We are currently extending Natu-
ralOWL to handle follow up questions about enti-
ties or classes mentioned in the generated texts.
