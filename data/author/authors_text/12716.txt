Abstract
The paper proposes a new method of linear text segmentation based on
lexical cohesion of a text. Namely, first a single chain of disambiguated
words in a text is established, then the rips of this single chain are consid-
ered as boundaries for the segments of the cohesion text structure (Cohe-
sion TextTiling or CTT). The summaries of arbitrarily length are obtained
by extraction using three different methods applied to the obtained seg-
ments. The informativeness of the obtained summaries is compared with
the informativeness of the pair summaries of the same length obtained us-
ing an earlier method of logical segmentation by text entailment (Logical
TextTiling or LTT). Some experiments about CTT and LTT methods are
carried out for four ?classical" texts in summarization literature showing
that the quality of the summarization using cohesion segmentation (CTT)
is better than the quality using logical segmentation (LTT).

1 Introduction
Text summarization has become the subject of an intense research in the last years
and it is still an emerging field (Orasan, 2006; Radev et al, 2002; Hovy, 2003; Mani,
2001). The research is done in the extracts (which we are treating in this paper) and
abstracts areas. The most important task of summarization is to identify the most
informative (salient) parts of a text comparatively with the rest. A good segmentation
of a text could help in this identification (Boguraev and Neff, 2000; Barzilay and
Elhadad, 1999; Reynar, 1998).
This paper proposes a new method of linear text segmentation based on lexical
cohesion of a text. Namely, first a single chain of disambiguated words in a text is
established, then the rips of this chain are considered. These rips are boundaries of the
segments in the cohesion structure of the text. Due to some similarities with TextTiling
algorithm for topic shifts detection of Hearst (1997), the method is called Cohesion
TextTiling (CTT).
The paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we present the problem of Word
Sense Disambiguation by a chain algorithm and the derived CTT method. In Sec-
tion 3, some notions about textual entailment and logical segmentation of a text by
LTT method are discussed. Summarization by different methods after segmentation
is the topic of Section 4. The parallel application of CTT and LTT methods to four
"classical" texts in summarization literature, two narrative and two newspapers, and
some statistics of the results are presented in Section 5. We finish the article with
conclusions and possible further work directions.
2 A top-down cohesion segmentation method
2.1 Lexical chains
A lexical chain is a sequence of words such that the meaning of each word from the se-
quence can be obtained unambiguously from the meaning of the rest of words (Morris
and Hirst, 1991; Barzilay and Elhadad, 1999; Harabagiu and Moldovan, 1997; Silber
and McCoy, 2002; Stokes, 2004). The map of all lexical chains of a text provides a
representation of the lexical cohesive structure of the text. Usually a lexical chain is
obtained in a bottom-up fashion, by taking each candidate word of a text, and finding
an appropriate relation offered by a thesaurus as Rodget (Morris and Hirst, 1991) or
WordNet (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1999). If it is found, the word is inserted with the
appropriate sense in the current chain, and the senses of the other words in the chain
are updated. If no relation is found, then a new chain is initiated.
Our method approaches the construction of lexical chains in a reverse order: we
first disambiguate the whole text and then construct the lexical chains which cover as
much as possible the text.
2.2 CHAD algorithm
It is known that in the last years many researchers studied the possibility to globally
disambiguate a text. In Tatar et al (2007) is presented CHAD algorithm, a Lesk?s
type algorithm based on WordNet, that doesn?t require syntactic analysis and syntac-
tic parsing. As usually for a Lesk?s type algorithm, it starts from the idea that a word?s
dictionary definition is a good indicator for the senses of this word and uses the defi-
Top-down Cohesion Segmentation in Summarization 391
nition in the dictionary directly. The base of the algorithm is the disambiguation of a
triplet of words, using Dice?s overlap or Jaccard?s measures. Shortly, CHAD begins
with the disambiguation of a triplet w1w2w3 and then adds to the right the following
words to be disambiguated. Hence it disambiguates at a time a new triplet, where first
two words are already associated with the best senses and the disambiguation of the
third word depends on the disambiguation of these first two words.
Due to the brevity of definitions in WordNet (WN), the first sense in WN for a word
wi (WN 1st sense) must be associated in some cases in a "forced" way. The forced
condition represents the situation that any sense of wi is related with the senses of the
words wi?2 and wi?1. Thus the forced condition signals that a lexical chain stops,
and, perhaps, a new one begins.
Comparing the precision obtained with CHAD and the precision obtained by the
WN 1st sense algorithm for 10 files of Brown corpus (Tatar et al, 2007) we obtained
the result: for 7 files the difference was greater or equal to 0.04 (favorable to WN 1st),
and for 3 files was lower. For example, in the worst case (Brown 01 file), the precisions
obtained by CHAD are: 0.625 for Dice?s measure, 0.627 for Overlap measure, 0.638
for Jaccard?s measure while the precision obtained by WN 1st sense is 0.688. Let us
remark that CHAD is used to mark the discontinuity in cohesion, while WN 1st sense
algorithm is unable to do this.
2.3 CHAD and lexical chains
The CHAD algorithm shows what words in a sentence are unrelated as senses with
the previously words: these are the words which receive a "forced" first WN sense.
Of course, these are regarded differently from the words which receive a "justified"
first WN sense. Scoring each sentence of a text by the number of "forced" to first WN
sense words in this sentence, we will provide a representation of the lexical cohesive
structure of the text. If F is this number, then the valleys (the local minima) in the
graph representing the function 1/F will represent the boundaries between lexical
chains (see Figure 2).
Lexical chains could serve further as a basis for an algorithm of segmentation. As
our method of determination of lexical chains is linear, the corresponding segmenta-
tion is also linear. The obtained segments could be used effectively in summarization.
In this respect, our method of summarization falls in the discourse-based category.
In contrast with other theories about discourse segmentation, as Rhetorical Struc-
ture Theory (RST) of Mann and Thompson (1988), attentional/intentional structure
of Grosz and Sidner (1986) or parsed RST tree of Marcu (1997), our CTT method
(and also, as presented below, our LTT method) supposes a linear segmentation (ver-
sus hierarchical segmentation) which results in an advantage from a computational
viewpoint.
3 Segmentation by Logical TextTiling
3.1 Text entailment
Text entailment is an autonomous field of Natural Language Processing and it rep-
resents the subject of some recent Pascal Challenges. As is established in an earlier
paper (Tatar et al, 2007), a text T entails an hypothesis H, denoted by T ? H, iff H
is less informative than T . A method to prove T ? H which relies on this definition
392 Tatar, Mihis, and Serban
consists in the verification of the relation: sim(T,H)T ? sim(T,H)H . Here sim(T,H)T
and sim(T,H)H are text-to-text similarities introduced in Corley and Mihalcea (2005).
The method used by our tool for Text entailment verification calculates the similarity
between T and H by cosine, thus the above relation becomes cos(T,H)T ? cos(T,H)H
(Tatar et al, 2007).
3.2 Logical segmentation
Tatar et al (2008) present a method named logical segmentation because the score of
a sentence is the number of sentences of the text which are entailed by it. Representing
the scores of sentences as a graph, we obtain a structure which indicates how the most
important sentences alternate with ones less important and which organizes the text
according to its logical content. Simply, a valley (a local minimum) in the obtained
logical structure of the text is a boundary between two logical segments (see Figure 1).
The method is called Logical TextTiling (LTT), due to some similarities with the
TextTiling algorithm for topic shifts detection (Hearst, 1997). The drawback of LTT,
that the number of the segments is fixed for a given text (as it results from its logical
structure), is eliminated by a method to dynamically correlate the number of the logi-
cal segments obtained by LTT with the required length of the summary. Let us remark
that LTT does not require a predicate-argument analysis. The only semantic structure
processing required is the Text Entailment verification.
4 Summarization by segmentation
4.1 Scoring the segments
An algorithm of segmentation has usually the following function:
INPUT: a list of sentences S1, ...,Sn and a list of scores score(S1), ...,score(Sn);
OUTPUT: a list of segments Seg1, ...,SegN .
Given a set of N segments (obtained by CTT or LTT) we need a criterion to select
those sentences from a segment which will be introduced in the summary. Thus,
after the score of a sentence is calculated, we calculate a score of a segment. The final
score, Score f inal, of a sentence is weighted by the score of the segment which contains
it. The summary is generated by selecting from each segment a number of sentences
proportional with the score of the segment. The method has some advantages when a
desired level of granularity of summarization is imposed.
The summarization algorithm with Arbitrarily Length of the summary (AL) is the
following:
INPUT: The segments Seg1, ...SegN, the length of summary X (as parameter),
Score f inal(Si) for each sentence Si;
OUTPUT: A summary SUM of length X, where from each segment Seg j are selected
NSenSeg j sentences. The method of selecting the sentences is given by defini-
tions Sum1,Sum2,Sum3 (Section 4.2).
Remark: A number of segments Seg j may have NSenSeg j > 1. If X < N then a
number of segments Seg j must have NSenSeg j = 0
Top-down Cohesion Segmentation in Summarization 393
In Section 5 (Experiments) the variant of summarization algorithm as above is de-
noted as Var1. In the variant Var2 a second choice of computing the score of a
segment is considered. Namely, the score is not normalized, and it is equal with the
sum of its sentences scores, without been divided to the segment length. The draw-
back of Var1 is that in some cases a very long segment can contain some sentences
with a high score and many sentences with a very low score, the final score of this
segment will be a small one and those important sentences will not be included in the
final summary. The drawback of Var2 is that of increased importance of the length
of the segment in some cases. Thus, the score of a short segment with high sentences
scores will be less then one of a long segment with small sentences scores, and again
some important sentences will be lost.
4.2 Strategies for summary calculus
The method of extracting sentences from the segments is decisive for the quality of
the summary. The deletion of an arbitrary amount of source material between two
sentences which are adjacent in the summary has the potential of losing essential in-
formation. We propose and compare some simple strategies for including sentences
in the summary:
? Our first strategy is to include in the summary the first sentence from each seg-
ment, as this is of special importance for a segment. The corresponding sum-
mary will be denoted by Sum1.
? The second way is that for each segment the sentence(s) with a maximal score
are considered the most important for this segment, and hence they are included
in the summary. The corresponding summary is denoted by Sum2.
? The third way of reasoning is that from each segment the most informative
sentence(s) (the least similar) relative to the previously selected sentences are
picked up. The corresponding summary is denoted by Sum3.
5 Experiments
In our experiments for CTT method each sentence is scored as following: Score(Si) =
1
nuwi where nuwi is the number of words "forced" to get the first WN sense in the
sentence Si. If nuwi = 0 then Score(Si) = 2. The graph of the logical structure for the
text Hirst is presented in Figure 1 while the graph for the cohesion structure for the
same text is presented in Figure 2.
We have applied CTT and LTT methods of segmentation and summarization to
four texts denoted in the following by: Hirst (Morris and Hirst, 1991), Koan (Richie,
1991), Tucker1 (Tucker, 1999) and Tucker2 (Tucker, 1999).1 The denotations are as
following: LSi for LTT with Sumi method, CSi for CTT with Sumi method. Also an
ideal summary (IdS) has been constructed by taking the majority occurrences of the
sentences in all LSi and CSi summaries. IdS is the last raw of the table. For the text
Tucker1 the summaries with five sentences obtained by us and the summary obtained
by the author with CLASP (Tucker, 1999) are presented in Table 1.

5.1 Evaluation of the summarization
There is no an unique formal method to evaluate the quality of a summary. In this
paper we use as a measure of the quality of a summary, the similarity (calculated
as cosine) between the summarized (initial) text and the summaries obtained with
different methods. We call this similarity "the informativeness".
The informativeness of the different types of summaries Sum1,Sum2,Sum3 (see
Section 4.2) and of different lengths (5, 6 and 10) is calculated for each text. Then, the
average informativeness for all four texts is calculated. A view with the these average
results of informativeness, calculated with different methods, in variants Var1 and
Var2, is given in the Table 2.
Let us remark that for obtaining summaries with different lengths, after a first seg-
mentation with CTT and LTT methods the algorithm AL from Section 4.1 is applied.
Table 2 displays the results announced in the abstract: the quality of CTT sum-
maries is better than the quality of the LTT summaries from the point of view of
informativeness.
5.2 Implementation details
The methods presented in this paper are fully implemented: we used our own systems
of Text Entailment verification, Word Sense Disambiguation, top-down lexical chains
determination, LTT and CTT segmentation, summarization with Sumi and AL meth-
ods. The programs are realized in Java and C++. WordNet (Miller, 1995) is used by
our system of Word Sense Disambiguation.
6 Conclusion and further work
This paper shows that the text segmentation by lexical chains and by text entailment
relation between sentences are good bases for obtaining highly accurate summaries.
Moreover, our method replaces the usually bottom-up lexical chain construction with
a top-down one, where first a single chain of disambiguated words is established and
then it is divided in a sequence of many shorter lexical chains. The segmentation of
text follows the sequence of lexical chains. Our methods of summarization control the
length of the summaries by a process of scoring the segments. Thus, more material is
extracted from the strongest segments.
396 Tatar, Mihis, and Serban
The evaluation indicates acceptable performance when informativeness of sum-
maries is considered. However, our methods have the potential to be improved: in
CTT method we correspond a segment to a lexical chain. We intend to improve our
scoring method of a segment by considering some recent method of scoring lexical
chains (Ercan and Cicekli, 2008). Also, we intend to study how anaphora resolution
could improve the lexical chains and the segmentation. We further intend to apply
the presented methods to the corpus of texts DUC2002 and to evaluate them with the
standard ROUGE method (for our experiments we didn?t have the necessary human
made summaries).
