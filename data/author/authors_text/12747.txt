Abstract 
This paper presents a CRF (Conditional 
Random Field) model for Semantic 
Chunk Annotation in a Chinese Question 
and Answering System (SCACQA). The 
model was derived from a corpus of real 
world questions, which are collected 
from some discussion groups on the 
Internet. The questions are supposed to 
be answered by other people, so some of 
the questions are very complex. Mutual 
information was adopted for feature se-
lection.  The training data collection con-
sists of 14000 sentences and the testing 
data collection consists of 4000 sentences. 
The result shows an F-score of 93.07%.

1 Introduction 
1.1 Introduction of Q&A System 
Automated question answering has been a hot 
topic of research and development since the ear-
liest AI applications (A.M. Turing, 1950). Since 
then there has been a continual interest in proc-
essing knowledge and retrieving it efficiently to 
users automatically. The end of the 1980s saw a 
boost in information retrieval technologies and 
applications, with an unprecedented growth in 
the amount of digital information available, an 
explosion of growth in the use of computers for 
communications, and the increasing number of 
users that have access to all this information 
(Diego Moll?and Jose?Luis Vicedo, 2007).  
Search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Baidu 
and etc have made a great success for people?s 
information need. 
Anyhow, search engines are keywords-based 
which can only return links of relevant web 
pages, failing to provide a friendly user-interface 
with queries expressed in natural language sen-
tences or questions, or to return precise answers 
to users. Especially from the end of the 1990s, as 
1
information retrieval technologies and method-
ologies became mature and grew more slowly in 
pace, automated question answering(Q&A) sys-
tems which accept questions in free natural lan-
guage formations and return exactly the answer 
or a short paragraph containing relevant informa-
tion has become an urgent necessity. Major in-
ternational evaluations such as TREC, CLEF and 
NTCIR have attracted the participation of many 
powerful systems.  
The architecture of a Q&A system generally in-
cludes three modules: question processing, can-
didate answer/document retrieval, and answer 
extraction and re-ranking.      
1.2 Introduction of Question Analyzing      
Question Analyzing, as the premise and founda-
tion of the latter two modules, is of paramount 
importance to the integrated performance of a 
Q&A system. The reason is quite intuitive: a 
question contains all the information to retrieve 
the corresponding answer. Misinterpretation or 
too much loss of information during the process-
ing will inevitably lead to poor precision of the 
system. 
The early research efforts and evaluations in 
Q&A were focused mainly on factoid questions 
asking for named entities, such as time, numbers, 
and locations and so on. The questions in the test 
corpus of TREC and other organizations are also 
in short and simple form. Complex hierarchy in 
question types (Dragomir Radev et al 2001), 
question templates (Min-Yuh Day et al 2005), 
question parsing (Ulf Hermjakob, 2001) and 
various machine learning methods (Dell Zhang 
and Wee Sun Lee, 2003)are used for factoid 
question analysis, aiming to find what named 
entity is asked in the question. There are some 
questions which are very complicated or even 
need domain restricted knowledge and reasoning 
technique. Automatic Q&A system can not deal 
with such questions with current technique.    
In china, there is a new kind of web based Q&A 
system which is a special kind of discussion 
group. Unlike common discussion group, in the 
web based Q&A system one user posts a ques-
tion, other users can give answers to it. It is 
found that at least 50% percent questions 
(Valentin Jijkoun and Maarten de Rijke, 
2005)posted by users are non-factoid and surely 
more complicated both in question pattern and 
information need than those questions in the test 
set of TREC and other FAQ.  An example is as 
follows: 
 
This kind of Q&A system can complement the 
search engines effectively.  As the best search 
engines in china, Baidu open the Baidu Knowl-
edge2 Q&A system from 2003, and now it has 
more than 29 million question-answer pairs. 
There are also many other systems of this kind 
such as Google Groups, Yahoo Answers and 
Sina Knowledge3. This kind of system is a big 
question-answer pair database which can be 
treated as a FAQ database. How to search from 
the database and how to analyze the questions in 
the database needs new methods and techniques.   
More deeper and precise capture of the semantics 
in those complex questions is required. This phe-
nomenon has also been noticed by some re-
searchers and organizations. The spotlight gradu-
ally shifted to the processing and semantic un-
derstanding of complex questions. From 2006, 
TREC launched a new annually evaluation 
CIQ&A (complex, interactive Question Answer-
ing), aiming to promote the development of in-
teractive systems capable of addressing complex 
information needs. The targets of national pro-
grams AQUAINT and QUETAL are all at new 
interface and new enhancements to current state-
of-the-art Q&A systems to handle more complex 
inputs and situations. 
A few researchers and institutions serve as pio-
neers in complex questions study. Different tech-
nologies, such as definitions of different sets of 
question types, templates and sentence patterns 
(Noriko Tomuro, 2003) (Hyo-Jung Oh et al 
2005) machine learning methods (Radu Soricut 
and Eric Brill, 2004), language translation model 
(Jiwoon Jeon, W et al 2005), composition of 
information needs of the complex question 
(Sanda Harabagiu et al 2006) and so on, have 
been experimented on the processing of complex 
question, gearing the acquired information to the 
facility of other Q&A modules.  
Several major problems faced now by researcher 
of complex questions are stated as follow:  
First: Unlike factoid questions, it is very dif-
ficult to define a comprehensive type hierarchy 
for complex questions. Different domains under 
research may require definitions of different sets 
of question types, as shown in (Hyo-Jung Oh et 
al, 2005). Especially, the types of certain ques-

2
tions are ambiguous and hard to identify. For 
example: 
 
This question type can be treated as definition, 
procedure or entity. 
Second: Lack of recognition of different seman-
tic chunks and the relations between them. 
FAQFinder (Radu Soricut and Eric Brill, 2004) 
also used semantic measure to credit the similar-
ity between different questions. Nevertheless, the 
question similarity is only a simple summation of 
the semantic similarity between words from the 
two question sentences. Question pattern are very 
useful and easy to implement, as justified by pre-
vious work. However, just like the problem with 
question types, question patterns have limitation 
on the coverage of all the variations of complex 
question formation. Currently, after the question 
processing step in most systems, the semantic 
meaning of large part of complex questions still 
remain vague. Besides, confining user?s input 
only within the selection of provided pattern may 
lead to unfriendly and unwelcome user interface. 
(Ingrid Zukerman and Eric Horvitz, 2001) used 
decision tree to model and recognize the infor-
mation need, question and answer coverage, 
topic, focus and restrictions of a question. Al-
though features employed in the experiments 
were described in detail, no selection process of 
those feature, or comparison between them was 
mentioned. 
This paper presents a general method for Chinese 
question analyzing. Our goal is to annotate the 
semantic chunks for the question automatically.  
2 Semantic Chunk Annotation 
Chinese language differs a lot from English in 
many aspects. Mature methodologies and fea-
tures well-justified in English Q&A systems are 
valuable sources of reference, but no direct copy 
is possible.  
The Ask-Answer system 4  is a Chinese online 
Q&A system where people can ask and answer 
questions like other web based Q&A system. The 
characteristic of this system is that it can give the 
answer automatically by searching from the 
asked question database when a new question is 
presented by people. The architecture of the 
automatically answer system is shown in figure 1.  
The system contains a list of question-answer 
pairs on particular subject. When users input a 
                                                 
 
 
 
4 http://haitianyuan.com/qa 
question from the web pages, the question is 
submitted to the system and then question-
answer pair is returned by searching from the 
questions asked before. The system includes four 
main parts: question pre-processing, question 
analyzing, searching and answer getting.  
The question pre-processing part will segment 
the input questions into words, label POS tags 
for every word.  Sometimes people ask two or 
more questions at one time, the questions should 
be made into simple forms by conjunctive struc-
ture detection. The question analyzing program 
will find out the question type, topic, focus and 
etc. The answer getting part will get the answer 
by computing the similarity between the input 
question and the questions asked before. The 
question analyzing part annotates the semantic 
chunks for the question. So that the question can 
be mapped into semantic space and the question 
similarity can be computed semantically. The 
Semantic chunk annotation is the most important 
part of the system.

Currently, no work has been reported yet on the 
question semantic chunk annotation in Chinese. 
The prosperity of major on-line discussion 
groups provides an abundant ready corpus for 
question answering research. Using questions 
collected from on-line discussion groups; we 
make a deep research on semantic meanings and 
build a question semantic chunk annotation 
model based on Conditional Random Field. 
Five types of semantic chunks were defined: 
Topic, Focus, Restriction, Rubbish information 
and Interrogative information. The topic of a 
3
question which is the topic or subject asked is the 
most important semantic chunk. The focus of a 
question is the asking point of the question. The 
restriction information can restrict the question?s 
information need and the answers. The rubbish 
information is those words in the question that 
has no semantic meanings for the question. Inter-
rogative information is a semantic tag set which 
corresponds to the question type. The interroga-
tive information includes interrogative words, 
some special verbs and nouns words and all these 
words together determine the question type. The 
semantic chunk information is shown in table 1.

Other O other information without

Description Wdes The answer need description
Yes/No Wyes The answer should be yes or 
no 
List Wlis The answer should be a list 
of entity 
Definition Wdef The answer is the definition 
of topic 
Location Wloc The answer is location 
Reason Wrea The answer can explain the 
question 
Contrast Wcon The answer is the compari-
son of the items proposed in 
the question 
People Wwho The answer is about the 
people?s information 
Choice Wcho The answer is one of the 
choice proposed in the ques-
tion 
Time Wtim The answer is the data or 
time length about the event 
in the question 
Entity Went The answer is the attribute 
of the topic. 
Table 1: Semantic chunks  
An annotation example question is as follows: 
 
This question can be annotated as follows: 
 
This kind of annotation is not convenient for CRF 
model, so the tags were transfer into the B I O 
form. (Shown as follows) 
 
Then the Semantic chunk annotation can be 
treated as a sequence tag problem.  
3 Semantic Chunk Annotation model 
3.1 Overview of the CRF model 
The conditional random field (CRF) is a dis-
criminative probabilistic model proposed by John 
Lafferty, et al(2001) to overcome the long-range 
dependencies problems associated with genera-
tive models. CRF was originally designed to la-
bel and segment sequences of observations, but 
can be used more generally. Let X, Y be random 
variables over observed data sequences and cor-
responding label sequences, respectively. For 
simplicity of descriptions, we assume that the 
random variable sequences X and Y have the 
same length, and use [ ]mxxxx ......, 21=   
and [ ]myyyy ......, 21=  to represent instances of 
X and Y, respectively. CRF defines the condi-
tional probability distribution P(Y |X) of label 
sequences given observation sequences as fol-

In equation 2 the i? is a model parameter and 
 is a feature function (often binary-
valued) that becomes positive (one for binary-
valued feature function) when X contains a cer-
tain feature in a certain position and Y takes a 
certain label, and becomes zero otherwise. 
Unlike Maximum Entropy model which use sin-
gle normalization constant to yield a joint distri-
bution, CRFs use the observation-dependent 
normalization  for conditional distribu-
tions. So CRFs can avoid the label biased prob-
lem. Given a set of training data

3.2 Features for the model 
The following features, which are used for train-
ing the CRF model, are selected according to the 
empirical observation and some semantic mean-
ings. These features are listed in the following 
table.

Table 2: the Features for the model 
Current word: 
The current word should be considered when 
adding semantic tag for it. But there are too 
many words in Chinese language and only part 
of them will contribute to the performance, a set 
of words was selected. The word set includes 
segment note and some key words such as time 
key word and rubbish key word. When the cur-
rent word is in the word set the current word fea-
ture is the current word itself, and null on the 
other hand. 
Current POS tag: 
Current POS tag is the part of speech tag for the 
current word. 
Pre-1 word POS tag: 
Pre- 1 word POS tag is the POS tag of the first 
word before the labeling word in the sentence. If 
the Pre-1 word does not exit (the current is the 
first word in the sentence), the Pre- 1 word POS 
tag is set to null. 
Pre-2 word POS tag: 
Pre- 2 word POS tag is the POS tag of the second 
word before the labeling word in the sentence. If 
the Pre-2 word does not exit, the Pre- 2 word 
POS tag is set to null. 
Post -1 word POS tag: 
Post - 1 word POS tag is the POS tag of the first 
word after the labeling word in the sentence. If 
the Post -1 word does not exit (the current is the 
first word in the sentence), the Post - 1 word POS 
tag is set to null. 
Post -2 word POS tag: 
Post - 2 word POS tag is the POS tag of the sec-
ond word after the labeling word in the sentence. 
If the Post-2 word does not exit, the Pre- 2 word 
POS tag is set to null. 
Question pattern: 
Question pattern which is associated with ques-
tion type, can locate question topic, question fo-
cus by surface string matching. For example, 
(where is <topic>). The patterns are extracted 
from the training data automatically. When a pat-
tern is matched, it is treated as a feature. There 
are 1083 question patterns collected manually.  
Question type: 
Question type is an important feature for ques-
tion analyzing. The question patterns have the 
ability of deciding the question type. If there is 
no question pattern matching the question, the 
question type is defined by a decision tree algo-
rithm. 
Is pattern key word: 
For each question pattern, there are some key 
words. When the current word belongs to the 
pattern key word this feature is set to ?yes?, else 
it is set to ?no?. 
Pattern tag: 
When a pattern is matched, the topic, focus and 
restriction can be identified by the pattern. We 
can give out the tags for the question and the tags 
are treated as features. If there is no pattern is 
matched, the feature is set to null.   
4 Feature Selection experiment 
Feature selection is important in classifying sys-
tems such as neural networks (NNs), Maximum 
Entropy, Conditional Random Field and etc. The 
problem of feature selection has been tackled by 
many researchers. Principal component analysis 
(PCA) method and Rough Set Method are often 
used for feature selection. Recent years, mutual 
information has received more attention for fea-
ture selection problem.  
According to the information theory, the uncer-
tainty of a random variable X can be measured 
by its entropy . For a classifying problem, 
there are class label set represented by C and fea-
ture set represented by F. The conditional en-
tropy  measures the uncertainty about 
)(XH
)|( FCH
5
C when F is known, and the Mutual information 
I(C, F) is defined as:  
 F)|(C -(C));( HHFCI =                   (4) 
The feature set is known; so that the objective of 
training the model is to minimize the conditional 
entropy   equally maximize the mutual 
information . In the feature set F, some 
features are irrelevant or redundant. So that the 
goal of a feature selection problem is to find a 
feature S ( ), which achieve the higher 
values of . The set S is a subset of F and 
its size should be as small as possible. There are 
some algorithms for feature selection problem. 
The ideal greedy selection algorithm using mu-
tual information is realized as follows (Nojun 
Kwak and Chong-Ho Choi, 2002): 
)|( FCH
);( FCI
FS ?
);( FCI
 Input:   S- an empty set 
             F- The selected feature set 
Output:  a small reduced feature set S which is 
equivalent to F 
Step 1: calculate the MI with the Class 
set C , , compute  Ffi ?? );( ifCI
Step 2: select the feature that maximizes , 
set  
);( ifCI
}{},{\ ii fSfFF ??
Step 3: repeat until desired number of features 
are selected. 
1) Calculate the MI with the Class set C and S, 
Ffi ?? , compute  ),;( ifSCI
2) Select the feature that maximizes , 
set 
),;( ifSCI
}{},{\ ii fSfFF ??  
Step 4: Output the set S  that contains the se-
lected features 
To calculate MI the PDFs (Probability Distribu-
tion Functions) are required. When features and 
classing types are dispersing, the probability can 
be calculated statistically.  In our system, the 
PDFs are got from the training corpus statistically. 
The training corpus contains 14000 sentences. 
The training corpus was divided into 10 parts, 
with each part 1400 sentences.  And each part is 
divided into working set and checking set. The 
working set, which contains 90% percent data, 
was used to select feature by MI algorithm. The 
checking set, which contains 10% percent data, 
was used to test the performance of the selected 
feature sequence. When the feature sequence was 
selected by the MI algorithm, a sequence of CRF 
models was trained by adding one feature at each 
time. The checking data was used to test the per-
formance of these models.

Table 3: the feature selection result and the test result 
In table 3, each row contains data corresponding 
to one part of the training corpus so there are ten 
rows with data in the table. The third row corre-
sponds to the first part and the last row corre-
sponds to the tenth part. There are eleven col-
umns in the table, the first columns is the fea-
tures sequence selected by the mutual informa-
tion algorithm for each part. The second column 
is the open test result with the first feature in the 
feature sequence. The third column is the open 
test result with the first two features in the fea-
ture sequence and so on. From the table, it is 
6
clear that the feature 7(Question pattern) and 
10(Pattern tag) are very important, while the fea-
ture 8(Question type) and 9(Is pattern key word) 
are not necessary. The explanation about this 
phenomenon is that the ?pattern key word? and 
?Question type? information can be covered by 
the Question patterns. So feature 8 and 9 are not 
used in the Conditional Random Field model. 
5 Semantic Chunk Annotation Experi-
ment 
The test and training data used in our system are 
collected from the website (Baidu knowledge 
and the Ask-Answer system), where people pro-
posed questions and answers. The training data 
consists of 14000 and the test data consists of 
4000 sentences. The data set consists of word 
tokens, POS and semantic chunk tags. The POS 
and semantic tags are assigned to each word to-
kens.  
The performance is measured with three rates: 
precision (Pre), recall (Rec) and F-score (F1).

Match is the count of the tags that was predicted 
right. Model is the count of the tags that was pre-
dicted by the model. Manual is the count of the 
tags that was labeled manually. 
Table 4 shows the performance of annotation of 
different semantic chunk types. The first column 
is the semantic chunk tag. The last three columns 
are precision, recall and F1 value of the semantic 
chunk performance, respectively.

Table 4: the performance of different semantic chunk
 
The semantic chunk type of ?Topic? and ?Focus? 
can be annotated well. Topic and focus semantic 
chunks have a large percentage in all the seman-
tic chunks and they are important for question 
analyzing. So the result is really good for the 
whole Q&A system. 
As for ?Rubbish? semantic chunk, it only has 
0.51 and 0.0 F1 measure for B-Ru and I-Ru. One 
reason is lacking enough training examples, for 
there are only 1031 occurrences in the training 
data. Another reason is sometimes restriction is 
complex. 
6 Conclusion and future work 
This paper present a new method for Chinese 
question analyzing based on CRF. The features 
are selected by using mutual information algo-
rithm. The selected features work effectively for 
the CRF model. The experiments on the test data 
set achieve 93.07% in F1 measure. In the future, 
new features should be discovered and new 
methods will be used.
