Voice over IP and the open source technologies are 
becoming popular choices for organizations. 
However, while accessing the VoiceXML gateways 
these systems fail to attract the global users 
economically. The objective of this paper is to 
demonstrate how an existing web application can be 
modified using VoiceXML to enable non-visual 
access from any phone. Moreover, we unleash a way 
for linking an existing PSTN-based phone line to a 
VoiceXML gateway even though the voice service 
provider (VSP) does not provide a local 
geographical number to global customers to access 
the application. In addition, we introduce an 
economical way for small sized businesses to 
overcome the high cost of setting up and using a 
commercial VoiceXML gateway. The method is 
based on Asterisk server. In order to elucidate the 
entire process, we present a sample Package 
Tracking System application, which is based on an 
existing website and provides the same functionality 
as the website does. We also present an online 
demonstration, which provides global access to 
commercial voice platforms (i.e. Voxeo, Tellme 
Studio, Bevocal and DemandVoice). This paper also 
discusses various scenarios in which spoken 
interaction can play a significant role. 
 
1    Introduction 
 
The end of the 20th century witnesses an explosive growth in 
Internet usage. We have seen an explosion in the number of 
browser-based visual applications, from the broad examples 
we use every day, such as e-commerce, movie or flight 
schedules, and financial information. The most common 
means for accessing information residing on many websites 
across the globe is still the dominating interface of point and 
click with a mouse using the graphical user interface (GUI). 
Additionally, telephone is also widely used to access 
information. Still, in densely populated countries it seems to 
be difficult to handle large amounts of calls simultaneously, 
which leads to long call queues and frustrated customers.  
However, the challenge that is presented to the present 
Internet world is to make the enormous web content

accessible to users who don?t have the computers or maybe 
don?t have the money to buy as well as visually impaired 
users. Since speech is the most natural means of 
communication, especially for these users, voice will be a 
dominating mode in newly designed multi-modal (Oviatt, 
S.L., 1999) user interfaces for future devices. This calls for a 
revolutionary design of a voice user interface (VUI) to 
supplement the conventional GUIs. Internet and telephony 
used to be two separate technologies to build applications 
accessible over the phone. VoiceXML bridges the gap; it 
leverages the existing web infrastructure and enables web 
developers to build voice-enabled web applications 
accessible from any telephone, by anyone, anywhere, 
anytime. A major advantage of VoiceXML is that it provides 
web content over a simple telephone device, making it 
possible to access an application even without a computer 
and an Internet connection. VoiceXML finds ready 
acceptance in the business world due to the following 
reasons.  
Providing a voice-based interface with the web interface is 
an advantage to the visually challenged who are unable to use 
a visual interface. It is also possible to use the application for 
accessing a web-based interface even while on the move 
through a mobile phone, which is much easier to carry 
around than a personal computer. Phone applications are 
more spontaneous. Most people these days always have their 
phone on their hip. In many cases, the phone transaction can 
be completed before the PC even boots or you can log in. 
Lastly, there is no possibility of a virus from a phone call and 
it is typically much more secure. 
The number of telephone users is far greater than the 
number of people who use personal computers or the 
Internet.  
Thus, by using VoiceXML applications, we can reach out 
to more customers than is possible by using the Internet. 
Voice portals put all kinds of information at a consumer's 
fingertips anytime, anywhere. Customers just dial into the 
voice portal's 800 number and use simple voice commands to 
access whatever information they need. It's quick, easy, and 
effective, even from a car or the airport. However, it still fails 
to attract the huge global customers as they have to pay the 
long distance calling charge to access the information. Hence, 
this paper is an attempt to peep behind the curtain and 
analyze the market trends and thereby proposes a solution to 
resolve the current issues and satisfy the global customers by 
providing them a solution to access the VoiceXML gateway 
economically. The structure of this paper is as follows. In the 
17
 next section we present the voice hosting infrastructure. We 
then discuss our experimental results and finally conclude by 
presenting the scenario for using Voice User Interfacing 
followed by the summary of the outcome.  
 
2    Voice Hosting Infrastructure 
 
A voice hosting infrastructure requires many interlocking 
components such as telephony hardware, software: TTS (text 
to speech, ASR (automatic speech recognition), networking 
technology, monitoring and administrative services. We 
discuss all the essential elements bellow. 
2.1    Linking 
Most of the VoiceXML gateways (Ruiz, Q. Sanchez, M. 
2003) can operate VoiceXML speech applications on any 
standard web server and can support both static and dynamic 
content, and provide a high degree of scalability and 
platform-independence. Also, voice applications can be 
seamlessly integrated into existing enterprise web and IT 
infrastructure. There are two ways to accomplish the task: 
-Link your existing web server with VSP?s voice 
gateways. 
-Port your web applications to VSP?s web server. 
Linking an existing web application with VoiceXML 
gateways is fairly straightforward. As you see in figure 1, 
when a VoiceXML gateway receives a phone call, it looks at 
the number dialed to lookup the URL of the web server, then 
sends the HTTP request. You need to provide the URL of 
your web server to VSP. One VSP provides Web-based GUI 
for linking an application as shown in Figure 1.  
There may be some changes required to your Web server 
before you connect with your VSP. Changes vary from VSP 
to VSP, or depending on your service provider and type of 
Web server. As an example, our application residing on an 
Apache HTTP Server, according to Bevocal, must modify the 
httpd.conf file to add the new MIME type in the following 
way. 
# AddType allows you to add to or override the MIME configuration. 
# file mime.types for specific file types. 
# MIME types for VoiceXML-related content.             
AddType application/voicexml+xml                                .vxml    
AddType application/srgs                                               .gram .srgs   
AddType application/srgs+xml                                       .grxml     
AddType application/x-nuance-gsl                                 .gsl .grammar 
AddType application/x-nuance-dynagram-binary          .ngo. 
2.2    Mapping 
Speech-enabled Internet portals, or voice portals, are quickly 
becoming the hottest trend in e-commerce-broadening access 
to Internet content to everyone with the most universal 
communications device of all, the telephone.  Currently, 
voice hosting providers set up local toll free numbers or DID 
(direct inward dialing) numbers in order to access voice 
applications through their VoiceXML gateways. If the VSP is 
unable to provide the local DID numbers in the desired 
country, the users from that country have to pay international 
calling charges, which is sometimes quite expensive. We 
propose our idea to resolve this issue as follows. 
SIP Mapping: It totally depends upon the telephony 
infrastructure of the VoiceXML gateway. If it is asterisk-
based (Meggelen, J. V. Madsen, L. Smith J. 2007) then the 
job is fairly easy, otherwise it could be a tedious task to 
configure a VoiceXML gateway with a remote telephony 
network. Our proposed idea is independent of any kind of 
telephony infrastructure, provided it supports SIP signaling.

 The most promising way to connect a VoiceXML gateway 
with a third party's Asterisk server (any IP-PBX) is to use the 
ENUM service. In order to use ENUM DNS efficiently, there 
are few steps needed to be followed. First of all, at e164.org 
(Ruiz, Q. Sanchez, M. 2003), in the ENUM database, we 
need to register the IP address and DID number, which is 
landing on your SIP extension of VoiceXML Gateway, as 
depicted in the figure 2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2. ENUM Registration 
 
After editing the ENUM (tElephone NUmber Mapping) 
entry, we set up the ENUM trunk and outbound route on the 
remote IP-PBX machine. 
We are running Elastix IP-PBX (elastix.org) on the remote 
side because it is easy to manage the configuration through 
GUI on Elastix. Moreover, it is an open source technology, 
and comes with a self-installing package that installs a 
complete operating system, Asterisk PBX, FreePBX etc. 
9|.XXXXXXXXXXXXX (X matches any digit from 0 to 9) 
According to our dial plan shown above, let?s assume that 
we need to dial the American DID number 641-543-6745, 
and dialing pattern would be like: 916415436745. 
Our DID number 641-543-6745 is registered at e164.org. 
This means that when someone calls the DID, the call will 
land on the SIP number instead of DID number, as the 
e164.org DNS zone will provide the IP addressing and 
protocol information needed to connect to your VoiceXML 
gateway . In other words, the call will not go over the DID 
provider?s network (see figure 3).  
There would be a native or Packet2Packet SIP bridging 
between the VoiceXML gateway and remote IP-PBX. 
Ultimately, VSP and remote client will not pay any toll to 
PSTN operator or ITSP (Internet Telephony Service 
Provider) because the call bypasses their network. Moreover, 
the VSP does not need to open all the credentials of 
telephony setup of the VoiceXML gateway. So, most of the 
information will be isolated from the remote client. This is 
attractive to the VSP that does not want to register the sip 
number and IP address of the gateway in the ENUM 
(tElephone NUmber Mapping) database, (because some 
people are afraid to disclose their IP addresses to others). 
Moreover, they do not want to accept anonymous SIP calls, 
and want to run their own IP-PBX instead of using client?s 
IP-PBX. In that case, we propose a very easy solution to set 
up the SIP extension on the VoiceXML

Our IP-PBX is connected with Bevocal, Tellme Studio, 
Voxeo and DemandVoice. So, our Device Options look like 
as follows  
SIP/8773386225@voip.cafe.bevocal.com 
SIP/8005558965@sip.studio.tellme.com 
Both of the above mentioned methods are really good if VSP 
does not want to use a remote IP-PBX for outbound calls. 
On the contrary, when VSP wants to setup outbound calls on 
the remote machine, we propose another idea to accomplish 
the task. Fortunately, this is very easy to configure the

 machines on both sides, if a telephony infrastructure uses an 
asterisk-based PBX on both ends. 
In this scenario, we can register the machines with each other 
using username and secret or we can use IP-based 
authentication without registering with each other. Actually, 
it is very easy on Elastix because it uses a Freepbx for 
configuring most of the tasks of Asterisk server.  
In other words, it?s becoming less and less common to have 
static IP addresses. So, if you have a dynamic IP address it is 
good to go with username and secret. Typically, we have to 
deal with sip.conf and extensions.conf on Asterisk, provided 
you use sip protocol. For a sample configuration code 
(Meggelen, J. V. Madsen, L. Smith J. 2007) see subsection 
DID Mapping. 
DID Mapping: We have two scenarios to deal with: a) 
When a VoiceXML gateway does not support SIP signaling.  
b) When VSP wants to land the calls only on a DID number 
assigned for your application execution.  
First, if it is a toll free DID number then the remote client 
can dial through ENUM in order to connect with a toll free 
gateway, and call will land on the toll free network, which is 
connected with a VoiceXML gateway (see figure 5). It means 
a toll free subscriber has to pay for it, and the call between a 
remote IP-PBX and the toll free gateway would be free, 
because it will go over the internet. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 5. Remote toll free connectivity 
 
For example, we connect DemandVoice?s voice gateway 
using a toll free DID number remotely as follows: 
Set up the custom extension as we discussed in subsection 
SIP Mapping , and it will directly connect with a toll free 
gateway (see figure 6). 
SIP/8008042865@sip.tollfreegateway.com  
Or you can dial through ENUM as we discussed in 
subsection SIP Mapping.  
If it is a DID number and has no registration in the ENUM 
database then you need to originate the call using your ITSP, 
and the call will directly land on your DID assigned for your 
application by VSP. With the advent of VOIP technology, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure6. Asterisk CLI 
 
there has been a flood of ITSP (Internet Telephony Service 
Provider) all over the world. It is really hard to choose one. 
We have tested the following configuration using our Static 
IP address on Elastix with VTWhite (Internet Telephony 
Service Provider) for VOIP termination and origination. 
Peer Details:  
allow=ulaw 
canreinvite=no 
context=from-pstn 
disallow=all 
dtmf=rfc2833 
dtmfmode=rfc2833 
host=sip.vtwhite.com 
insecure=very 
nat=yes 
qualify=yes 
sendrpid=yes 
type=peer 
Since our IP address is registered with VTWhite.com, 
there is no need for more typical authentication or 
registration parameters. 
Inbound Routes: 
DID number:  1XXXXXXXXX (11 digits) 
Set destination for incoming calls landing on your DID. If 
you are dialing out through VTWhite you must set your 
outbound CID as follows: 
"1XXX-XXX-XXXX"<1XXXXXXXXXX> 
We have tested the following configuration with 
voiptalk.org (Internet Telephony Service Provider) using 
username and secret. 
Peers Details:  
host=voiptalk.org 
insecure=very 
secret=XXXX 
type=peer 
username=XXXX  
username:secret@voiptalk.org/username 
 
2.3    Porting 
Many organizations have their existing toll free phone 
numbers, and they want to connect their existing numbers 
with a voice portal, and don?t like to get a new phone 
number. Luckily, it is very easy in the United States to port 
the number from one carrier to another carrier. There are

 many independent ?RESPORG? (RESPonsible 
ORGanization) companies, which help for porting the 
numbers. 
If there are issues for porting the existing number, we 
propose a very simple idea to install an asterisk-based IP-
PBX at your premises and route the calls landing on your 
existing number to VoiceXML gateway using a sip or ITSP 
as we have discussed in section 2.2 Mapping. 
 
2.4    Editing 
Adding VoiceXML interface (Tsai, M.-J. 2005) (Kenneth, R. 
A. 2001) (Yankelovich, N., 2000) to web contents presents 
unique challenges to designers. Complexity depends upon the 
web application?s architecture. In this section, we 
demonstrate how to modify an existing package tracking web 
site powered by a relational database. We use PHP, MySQL, 
Apache web server, and these tools are widely used in web 
applications development, because these are cross-platform 
and open source technologies. There are a couple of ways to 
add voice user interfacing (VUI). It is possible to add 
VoiceXML tags either on the fly when the VoiceXML 
interpreter extracts the contents from the web server or in 
other case tags can be embedded into an existing web page. 
However, we concentrate only on the latter case. First of all 
let?s have a look on a web application (see figure 7) 
(Tracking number: 6754356786). This application is 
available on the following URL for demonstrating the task. 
http://biometrics.pcu.ac.kr/demo/search1.php

Figure 8. Call flow diagram for a VUI design 
We design the call flow diagram (see figure 8) of the 
package tracking application as follows: According to our 
flow chart we need to make two VoiceXML documents. 
Before adding the VoiceXML tags into your webpage you 
must check with your VSP how to specify the document type 
definition (DTD) in your VoiceXML documents. Since our 
application is linked with Bevocal platform (BeVocal Caf?, 
2007), we do the following way. 
Collecting the Tracking number-Voicexml Document-1 
(index.vxml) (see Appendix A). 
Tracking Report-Voicexml Document-2 (track.php)         
(see Appendix B).

provide PSTN numbers from 40 courtiers to access the 
VoiceXML gateway of Bevocal, Tellme Studio, 
DemandVoice and Voxeo. In order to test the sample

 package tracker you need to dial extension (1538408) for 
Bevocal after dialing the local number as depicted in Table 1. 
You need PIN: 1234 and Developer ID: 5369574 to access 
our application. User can also call our application from the 
following numbers without dialing any pin or extension 
numbers.  
Direct Numbers: 
Italy       Rome       06 916507970 
United Kingdom  Leeds       0113 350 8176 
United Kingdom  Manchester     0161 660 4556 
United States   Bellevue      1 425 998 0503              
To verify the performance of our proposed idea, we 
implemented an IP-PBX, an automated package tracker and 
the business listing search using VoiceXML, PHP, and 
MySQL. Then, we linked remotely with various VoiceXML 
gateways, and tried to call the application using different 
codecs (ulaw, g729, gsm). We found that ulaw codec is much 
better for interacting with the ASR engine, and also it 
provides the best voice quality since it uses no compression. 
This means that it has the lowest latency and the highest 
MOS (Mean Opinion Score) because there are no additional 
processing delays. However, it requires high bandwidth, and 
this can be easily managed via proper network provisioning. 
The compression has very adverse affect on speech 
recognition when it comes to deal with the ASR engine. The 
more compression is used, the more characters will be lost. 
Fortunately, ulaw is immune to this effect. Table 2 shows the 
call volume according to bandwidth and codec. Table 3 
shows the hardware and software specifications. 
We will try to keep alive these Geographical Distributed 
numbers for public use. Developers and researchers can test 
their applications by paying just local charges applied by the 
terminating PSTN operator. 
 
3.    Scenarios for Using Voice User Interfacing 
  
Despite the availability of various media of communication 
utilized in human computer interaction, people tend to prefer 
the more social medium of communication such as voice.  
With the advent of the Internet, the PC has become the most 
preferred device which people turn to when they need to 
enquire for information.  On the interaction side, the 
telephone seems to remain the best example for usability 
preferred by the various classes of users.  So, to power of 
voice communication, with the richness of the Internet on 
one side, and the usability of the phone device on the other 
side, we present various situations in which VUI can be of 
great utility.  
Situations: 
? Driving 
? No internet service 
? Visually Impaired persons 
? Replacement of human operators 
VUI is the most time efficient modality for input, because 
voice input is nimbler than typing. VUI can be used to check 
and answer web emails while driving a vehicle. Another class 
of situations is when there is no Internet or PC available and 
the user needs to access web applications such internet 
banking, parcel tracking, directory assistance, online 
reservation, order status enquiry, instant messaging, 
electronic voting, dating/chat services, and information 
services. Moreover, visually impaired people can take 
advantage of the above mentioned services just over the 
regular phone. Furthermore, in many situations cost 
efficiency can be increased by replacing human operators in 
call centers and offices with a VoiceXML-based interactive 
voice response system.

5.    Conclusion 
 
In this paper we have targeted the large number of 
international users who are deprived of taking the advantage 
of using the toll free number remotely, and have introduced 
an economical way to access VoiceXML gateways globally. 
Moreover, our globally distributed PSTN numbers are 
available to access VoiceXML platform for only research, 
test and educational purpose. We conclude that the call 
quality may differ depending upon the different feature sets 
(e.g., codecs) and network bandwidth available. In order to 
get a nice connectivity with a VoiceXML gateway, the call 
should pass through minimum VOIP gateways. Currently, we 
are developing a virtual user agent based on ATOM/RSS 
protocol, which can be accessed by phone globally for 
accessing information.
