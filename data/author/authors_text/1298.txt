Abstract
Previous attempts at identifying translational equiv-
alents in comparable corpora have dealt with very
large ?general language? corpora and words. We ad-
dress this task in a specialized domain, medicine,
starting from smaller non-parallel, comparable cor-
pora and an initial bilingual medical lexicon. We
compare the distributional contexts of source and
target words, testing several weighting factors and
similarity measures. On a test set of frequently oc-
curring words, for the best combination (the Jaccard
similarity measure with or without tf:idf weight-
ing), the correct translation is ranked first for 20% of
our test words, and is found in the top 10 candidates
for 50% of them. An additional reverse-translation
filtering step improves the precision of the top can-
didate translation up to 74%, with a 33% recall.
1 Introduction
One of the issues that have to be addressed
in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR,
Grefenstette (1998b)) is that of query transla-
tion, which relies on some form of bilingual
lexicon. Methods have been proposed to ac-
quire a lexicon from corpora when such a lex-
icon does not exist or is not complete enough
(Fung and McKeown, 1997; Fung and Yee, 1998;
Picchi and Peters, 1998; Rapp, 1999). The present
work addresses this issue in a specialized domain:
medicine. We aim at identifying French-English
translation candidates from comparable medical
corpora, extending an existing specialized bilingual
lexicon. These translational equivalents may then
be used, e.g., for query expansion and translation.
We first recall previous work on this topic, then
present the corpora and initial bilingual lexicon we
start with, and the method we use to build, trans-
fer and compare context vectors. We finally pro-
vide and discuss experimental results on a test set
of French medical words.
2 Background
Salton (1970) first demonstrated that with carefully
constructed thesauri, cross-language retrieval can
perform as well as monolingual retrieval. In many
experiments, parallel corpora have been used for
training statistical models for bilingual lexicon com-
pilation and disambiguation of query translation
(Hiemstra et al, 1997; Littman et al, 1998). A lim-
iting factor in these experiments was an expensive
investment of human effort for collecting large-size
parallel corpora, although Chen and Nie (2000)?s
experiments show a potential solution by automati-
cally collecting parallel Web pages.
Comparable corpora are ?texts which, though
composed independently in the respective lan-
guage communities, have the same communica-
tive function? (Laffling, 1992). Such non-parallel
texts can become prevalent in the development
of bilingual lexicons and in cross-language infor-
mation research as they may be easier to col-
lect than parallel corpora (Fung and Yee, 1998;
Rapp, 1999; Picchi and Peters, 1998). Among
these, Rapp (1999) proposed that in any language
there is a correlation between the cooccurrences
of words which are translations of each other.
Fung and Yee (1998) demonstrated that the asso-
ciations between a word and its context seed
words are preserved in comparable texts of dif-
ferent languages. By designing procedures to
retrieve crosslingual lexical equivalents together,
Picchi and Peters (1998) proposed that their system
could have applications such as retrieving docu-
ments containing terms or contexts which are se-
mantically equivalent in more than one language.
3 Collecting comparable medical corpora
The material for the present experiments con-
sists of comparable medical corpora in French
and English and a French-English medical lexicon
(Fung and Yee (1998) call its words ?seed words?).
3.1 ?Signs and Symptoms? Corpora
We selected two medical corpora from Inter-
net catalogs of medical web sites. Some of
these catalogs index web pages with controlled
vocabulary keywords taken from the MeSH
thesaurus (www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome),
among which CISMeF (French language med-
ical web sites, www.chu-rouen.fr/cismef) and
CliniWeb (English language medical web sites,
www.ohsu.edu/cliniweb). The MeSH thesaurus
is hierarchically structured, so that it is easy to
select a subfield of medicine. We chose the subtree
under the MeSH concept ?Pathological Conditions,
Signs and Symptoms? (?C23?), which is the best
represented in CISMeF.
We compiled the 2,338 URLs indexed by CIS-
MeF under that concept, and downloaded the cor-
responding pages, plus the pages directly linked to
them, so that framesets or tables of contents be ex-
panded. 9,787 pages were converted into plain text
from HTML or PDF, yielding a 602,484-word cor-
pus (41,295 unique words). The initial pages should
all be in French; the additional pages sometimes
happen to be foreign language versions of the ini-
tial ones. In the same line, we collected 2,019
pages under 921 URLs indexed by CliniWeb, and
obtained a 608,320-word English medical corpus
(32,919 unique words).
3.2 Base bilingual medical lexicon
A base French-English lexicon of simple words
was compiled from several sources. On the one
hand, an online French medical dictionary (Diction-
naire M?dical Masson, www.atmedica.com) which
includes English translations of most of its en-
tries. On the other hand, some international medical
terminologies which are available in both English
and French. We obtained these from the UMLS
metathesaurus, which includes French versions of
MeSH, WHOART, ICPC and their English coun-
terparts (www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls). The re-
sulting lexicon (see excerpt in table 1) contains
18,437 entries, mainly specialized medical terms.
When several translations of the same term are
available, they are all listed.
4 Methods
The basis of the method is to find the target words
that have the most similar distributions with a given
source word. We explain how distributional behav-
ior is approximated through context vectors, how

context vectors are transferred into target context
vectors, and how context vectors are compared.
4.1 Computing context vectors
Each input corpus is segmented at non-
alphanumeric characters. Stop words are then
removed, and a simple lemmatization is per-
formed. For English, we used a list of stop
words that we had from a former project. For
French, we merged Savoy?s online stop words list
(www.unine.ch/info/clef) with a list of our own.
The S-stemmer algorithm (Harman, 1991) was
applied to the English words. Another simple
stemmer was used for French; it handles some -s
and -x endings.
The context of occurrence of each word is then
approximated by the bag of words that occur within
a window of N words around any occurrence of that
?pivot? word. In the experiments reported here, N
was set to 3 (i.e., a seven-word window) to approxi-
mate syntactic dependencies. The context vector of
a pivot word j is the vector of all words in the cor-
pus,1 where each word i is represented by its num-
ber of occurrences occj
i
in that bag of words.
A context vector is similar to a document (the
document that would be produced by concatenating
the windows around all the occurrences of the given
pivot word). Therefore, weights that are used for
words in documents can be tested here in order to
eliminate word-frequency effects and to emphasize
significant word pairs. Besides simple context fre-
quency occj
i
, two additional, alternative weights are
computed: tf:idf and log likelihood.
1We shall see below that actually, only a subset of the corpus
words will be kept in each vector.
The formulas we used to compute tf:idf are the
following: the normalized frequency of a word i
in a context j is tf j
i
=
occ
j
i
max occ
where occj
i
is the
number of occurrences of word i in the context of j
and max
occ
= max
ij
occ
j
i
is the maximum number
of cooccurrences of any two words in the corpus;
idf
i
= 1 + log
max
occ
occ
i
(Sparck Jones, 1979) where
occ
i
is the total number of contexts in which i oc-
curs in the corpus.
For the computation of the log likelihood ratio,
we used the following formula from Dunning:2

.
At the end of this step, each non-stop word in
both corpora has a weighted context vector.
4.2 Transferring context vectors
When a translation is sought for a source word, its
context vector is transferred into a target language
context vector, relying on the existing bilingual lex-
icon. Only the words in the bilingual lexicon can
be used in the transfer. When several translations
are listed, only the first one is added to the target
context vector. The result is a target-language con-
text vector which is comparable to ?native? context
vectors directly obtained from the target corpus.
Let us now be more precise about the context-
word space. Since we want to compare context
vectors obtained through transfer with native con-
text vectors, these two sorts of vectors should be-
long to the same space, i.e., range over the same
set of context words. A (target) word belongs to
this set iff (i) it occurs in the target corpus, (ii) it
is listed in the bilingual lexicon, and (iii) (one of)
its source counterpart(s) occurs in the source cor-
pus. This set corresponds to the ?seed words? of
Fung and Yee (1998). Therefore, the dimension of
the target context vectors is reduced to this set of
?cross-language pivot words?. In our experimental
setting, 4,963 pivot words are used.
4.3 Computing vector similarity
Given a transferred context vector, for each native
target vector, a similarity score is computed; a rank-

(helmer.hit.uib.no/corpora/1997-2/0148.html).
ing list is built according to this score. The tar-
get words that ?own? the best-ranked target vectors
are the words in the target corpus whose distribu-
tions with respect to the bilingual pivot words are
the most similar to that of the source word; they are
considered candidate translational equivalents.
We used several similarity metrics for compar-
ing pairs of vectors V and W (of length n): Jac-
card (Romesburg, 1990) and cosine (Losee, 1998),
each combined with the three different weighting
schemes. With k; l;m ranging from 1 to n:

4.4 Experiments
The present work performs a first evaluation of this
method in a favorable, controlled setting. It tests, in
a ?leave-one-out? style, whether the correct transla-
tion of one of the source (French) words in the bilin-
gual lexicon can be found among the target (En-
glish) words of this lexicon, based on context vector
similarity. To make similarity measures more re-
liable, we selected the most frequent words in the
English corpus (N
occ
> 100) whose French trans-
lations were known in our lexicon. Among these,
we chose the most frequent ones (N
occ
> 60) in
the French corpus. This provides us with a test set
of 95 French words (i) which are frequent in the
French corpus, (ii) of which we know the correct
translation, and (iii) such that this translation oc-
curs often in the English corpus. For each of the
French test words, we computed a weighted con-
text vector for each of the different weighting mea-
sures (occj
i
, tf:idf , log likelihood). Then, using the
above-mentioned similarity measures (cosine, Jac-
card), we compared this weighted vector with the
set of cross-language pivot words?s context vectors
computed from the English corpus. We then pro-
duced a ranked list of the top translational equiv-
alents and tested whether the expected translation
can be differentiated from other well-known domain
words. For the evaluation, we computed the rank of
the expected translation of each test word and syn-
thesized them as a percentile rank distribution.

Figure 1: Percentile rank of the measures.
A percentile rank (figure 1) showed that using the
combination of occj
i
and Jaccard, about 20% of the
French test words have their correct translation as
the first ranked word. If we look at the best ranked
words, we find that they have a strong thematic rela-
tion: e.g., anxiety, depression, psychiatrist, phobia,
or infection, infected, aids, homosexual.
6 Discussion and Improvement Directions
As the percentile rank figure showed, the combi-
nation of context frequency weighting (occj
i
) and
Jaccard gives an accuracy of about 20% for cor-
rect translation which is followed by tf:idf /Jaccard
measures. However, if we look among the top 20
ranked words, we can find that the tf:idf /Jaccard
and tf:idf /cosine have better performance: more
than 60% of the words find their correct transla-
tions within the top 20 words, which is much better
than occj
i
/Jaccard and occj
i
/cosine. It seems that the
loglike weighting factor did not help to improve the
translation performance; this is true when we com-
bined it with the cosine measure, but with Jaccard,
we can see an improvement at the 20th percentile.
In some cases where the correct translation was
badly ranked, the French test words have different
usages, which induces an important context diver-
sity. For instance, for the French word chirurgie
whose expected translation is surgery, we have as
top ranked words pain, breast, desmoplasia, pro-
cedure, metastatic..., and for m?decine (medicine),
we have information, clinician, article, medical....
For common words like, e.g., analyse/analysis and
sang/blood, we have girdle, sample, statistic... for
analysis and output, collection, calorimetry... for
blood as best ranked translations.
As an attempt to improve the precision of the
French-English translation method, the same model
was applied in the reverse direction to find the
French counterparts of the 10 top-scoring English
candidates. We then kept only those English candi-
dates that had the initial French source word among
their top 10 reverse translation candidates. In the
present settings, only 42 of the 95 French source
words remained, 38 of which kept exactly one En-
glish candidate; among these, 27 are the expected
translation, and 1 is an adjective derived from the
expected translation (estomac/gastric). The other
4 words still have multiple translation candidates,
which can be ordered according to their combined
similarity scores: for 2 of them, the top ranked can-
didate is then correct, and 1 is a derived adjective
(th?rapie/therapeutic).
Altogether, if we propose the top ranked re-
maining candidate according to this scheme, re-
call/precision reach .31/.69, or .33/.74 if derived ad-
jectives are considered acceptable. This result is re-
ally encouraging as it shows that the reverse appli-
cation of the translation method to the English can-
didate words improves its effectiveness.
As a comparison, on a ?general language? cor-
pus, Rapp (1999) reports an accuracy of 65% at
the first percentile by using loglike weighting and
city-block metric.3 This difference in accuracy
may be accounted for by the larger size of the
corpora (135 and 163 Mwords), the use of a
general English-German lexicon (16,380 entries),
and the consideration of word order within con-
texts. In Fung and McKeown (1997), a transla-
tion model applied to a pair of unrelated languages
(English/Japanese) with a random selection of test
words, many of them multi-word terms, gives a pre-
cision around 30% when only the top candidate is
proposed.
Our bilingual lexicon does not include general
French and English words. This implies that some
contexts are ignored: all cooccurrences of a special-
ized word with a general word are lost in our case.
We therefore plan to explore the effectiveness of in-
corporating a general lexicon, as well as applying
POS-tagging to the corpus. An additional differ-
ence with Fung and Yee (1998) is that they look for
translational equivalents only among words that are
unknown in both corpora. This additional condition
might also help to improve our current results.
