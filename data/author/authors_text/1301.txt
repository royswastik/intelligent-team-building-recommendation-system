Abstract 
The aim of this study is to investigate the 
relationships between citations and the 
scientific argumentation found in the abstract. 
We extracted citation lists from a set of 3200 
full-text papers originating from a narrow 
domain.  In parallel, we recovered the 
corresponding MEDLINE records for analysis 
of the argumentative moves. Our 
argumentative model is founded on four 
classes: PURPOSE, METHODS, RESULTS, 
and CONCLUSION. A Bayesian classifier 
trained on explicitly structured MEDLINE 
abstracts generates these argumentative 
categories. The categories are used to generate 
four different argumentative indexes. A fifth 
index contains the complete abstract, together 
with the title and the list of Medical Subject 
Headings (MeSH) terms. To appraise the 
relationship of the moves to the citations, the 
citation lists were used as the criteria for 
determining relatedness of articles, 
establishing a benchmark. Our results show 
that the average precision of queries with the 
PURPOSE and CONCLUSION features is the 
highest, while the precision of the RESULTS 
and METHODS features was relatively low. A 
linear weighting combination of the moves is 
proposed, which significantly improves 
retrieval of related articles. 
1 Introduction 
Numerous techniques help researchers locate 
relevant documents in an ever-growing mountain 
of scientific publications. Among these techniques 
is the analysis of bibliographic information, which 
can identify conceptual connections between large 
numbers of articles. Although helpful, most of 
these systems deliver masses of documents to the 
researcher for analysis, which contain various 
degrees of similarity. This paper introduces a 
method to determine the similarity of a 
bibliographic co-citation list, that is the list of 
citations that are shared between articles, and the 
argumentative moves of an abstract in an effort to 
define novel similarity searches. 
 
Authors of biological papers develop arguments 
and present the justification for their experiments 
based on previously documented results. These 
results are represented as citations to earlier 
scientific literature and establish the links between 
old and new findings.  The assumption is that the 
majority of scientific papers employing the same 
citations depict related viewpoints. The method 
described here is applied to improve retrieval of 
similar articles based on co-citations, but other 
applications are foreseen. Documents that should 
be conceptually correlated due to bibliographic 
relatedness but which propose different or novel 
arguments are often not easily located in the 
majority of bibliographically correlated articles. 
Our system can be tuned to identify these 
documents. Conversely, such a system could also 
be used as a platform to aid authors by means of 
automatic assembly or refinement of their 
bibliographies through the suggestion of citations 
coming from documents containing similar 
arguments. 
 
The rest of this paper is structured as follows: 
section 2 describes the background related to 
experiments using citations or argumentation that 
compare aspects connected to the logical content 
of publications. Section 3 details the method and 
the generation of the different indexes used in our 
analyses, e.g. the citation index, the four 
argumentative indexes and the abstract index 
(abstract, title and keywords). Section 4 presents 
the results of the evaluations we performed. 
Section 5 closes with a summary of the 
contribution of this work, limitations and future 
work.  
2 Background 
Digital libraries aim at structuring their records to 
facilitate user navigation. Interfaces visualizing 
8
overlapping relationships of the standard library 
fields such as author and title in document 
collections are usually the most accessible to the 
user. Beyond these well-known targets, researchers 
(see de Bruijn and Martin, 2002, or Hirschman and 
al. 2002, for a survey) interested in information 
extraction and retrieval for biomedical applications 
have mostly focused on studying specific 
biological interactions (Stapley and Benoit, 2000; 
N?dellec et al, 2002; Dobrokhotov et al, 2003) 
and related entities (Collier et al, 2000; 
Humphreys et al, 2000; Yu et al, 2002; 
Yamamoto et al, 2003; Albert et al, 2003) or 
using terms in biomedical vocabularies (Nazarenko 
et al, 2001; Ruch et al, 2004; Srinivasan and 
Hristovski, 2004). The use of bibliographical and 
argumentative information (McKnight and 
Srinivasan 2003) has been less well studied by 
researchers interested in applying natural language 
processing to biomedical texts. 
2.1 Citations 
Originating from bibliometrics, citation analysis 
(White, 2003) has been used to visualize a field via 
a representative slice of its literature.  Co-citation 
techniques make it possible to cluster documents 
by scientific paradigm or hypothesis (Noyons et 
al., 1999). Braam et al, (1991) have investigated 
co-citation as a tool to map subject-matter 
specialties. They found that the combination of 
keyword analysis and co-citation analysis was 
useful in revealing the cognitive content of 
publications.   Peters et al, (1995) further explored 
the citation relationships and the cognitive 
resemblance in scientific articles. Word profile 
similarities of publications that were 
bibliographically coupled by a single, highly cited 
article were compared with publications that were 
not bibliographically coupled to that specific 
article. A statistically significant relationship has 
been established between the content of articles 
and their shared citations. This result will serve as 
basis to establish our benchmark without relevance 
judgments (Wu and Crestani, 2003; Soborrof et al, 
2001). 
2.2 Argumentation in biomedical abstracts 
Scientific research is often described as a problem 
solving activity. In full text scientific articles this 
problem-solution structure has been crystallized in 
a fixed presentation known as Introduction, 
Methods, Results and Conclusion. This structure is 
often presented in a much-compacted version in 
the abstract and it has been clearly demonstrated 
by Schuemie et al, (2004) that abstracts contain a 
higher information density than full text.  
Correspondingly, the 4-move problem-solving 
structure (standardized according to ISO/ANSI 
guidelines) has been found quite stable in scientific 
reports (Orasan, 2001). Although the 
argumentative structure of an article is not always 
explicitly labeled, or can be labeled using slightly 
different markers (as seen in Figure 1), a similar 
implicit structure is common in most biomedical 
abstracts (Swales, 1990). Therefore, to find the 
most relevant argumentative status that describes 
the content of the article, we employed a 
classification method to separate the content dense 
sentences of the abstracts into the argumentative 
moves. 
INTRODUCTION: Chromophobe renal cell 
carcinoma (CCRC) comprises 5% of neoplasms of 
renal tubular epithelium. CCRC may have a slightly 
better prognosis than clear cell carcinoma, but 
outcome data are limited.  PURPOSE: In this study, 
we analyzed 250 renal cell carcinomas to a) 
determine frequency of CCRC at our Hospital and b) 
analyze clinical and pathologic features of CCRCs.  
METHODS: A total of 250 renal carcinomas were 
analyzed between March 1990 and March 1999. 
Tumors were classified according to well-established 
histologic criteria to determine stage of disease; the 
system proposed by Robson was used. RESULTS: Of 
250 renal cell carcinomas analyzed, 36 were 
classified as chromophobe renal cell carcinoma, 
representing 14% of the group studied. The tumors 
had an average diameter of 14 cm. Robson staging 
was possible in all cases, and 10 patients were stage 
1) 11 stage II; 10 stage III, and five stage IV. The 
average follow-up period was 4 years and 18 (53%) 
patients were alive without disease.  CONCLUSION: 
The highly favorable pathologic stage (RI-RII, 58%) 
and the fact that the majority of patients were alive 
and disease-free suggested a more favorable 
prognosis for this type of renal cell carcinoma.

MEDLINE.  The 4-class argumentation model is 
sometimes split into classes that may carry slightly 
different names, as illustrated in this example by the 
INTRODUCTION marker. 
3 Methods 
We established a benchmark based on citation 
analysis to evaluate the impact of using 
argumentation to find related articles. In 
information retrieval, benchmarks are developed 
from three resources: a document collection, a 
query collection and a set of relevance rankings 
that relates each query to the set of documents. 
Existing information retrieval collections normally 
contain user queries composed of only a few 
words. These short queries are not suitable for 
evaluating a system tailored to retrieve articles 
with similar citations.  Therefore, we have created 
the collection and tuned the system to accept long 
queries such as abstracts (Figure 2). 
9
 
Figure 2:Flowchart for the chain of experimental procedures.  The benchmark was assembled from 
citations shared between documents and compared to the document similarity ranking of EasyIR. 
 
3.1 Data acquisition and citation indexing 
All the data used in these experiments were 
acquired from MEDLINE using the PubMed 
interface. 
 
Document Collection.. The document set was 
obtained from PubMed by executing a set of 
Boolean queries to recover articles related to small 
active peptides from many animal species 
excluding humans.  These peptides hold the 
promise of becoming novel therapeutics. The set 
consisted of 12500 documents, which were 
comprised of abstract, title and MeSH terms. For 
3200 of these documents we were able to recover 
the full text including the references for citation 
extraction and analysis.  
 
Queries.. Following statistical analysis confirmed 
by Buckley and Voorhees (2000), four sets of 25 
articles were selected from the 3200 full text 
articles. The title, abstract and MeSH terms fields 
were used to construct the queries.  For testing the 
influence the argumentative move, the specific 
sentences were extracted and tested either alone or 
in combination with the queries that contained the 
title, abstract and MeSH terms. 
 
Citation analysis.. Citation lists were 
automatically extracted from 3200 full-text articles 
that were correspondingly represented within the 
document set. This automatic parsing of citations 
was manually validated. Each citation was 
represented as a unique ID for comparison 
purposes. Citation analysis of the entire collection 
demonstrated that the full-text articles possessed a 
mean citation count of 28.30 + 24.15  (mean + 
S.D.) with a 95% CI  = 27.47 ? 29.13.  Within 
these records the mean co-citation count was 7.79 
+ 6.99 (mean + S.D.) with a 95% CI  = 7.55 ? 8.03.  
As would be expected in a document set which 
contains a variety of document types (reviews, 
journal articles, editorials), the standard deviations 
of these values are quite large.   
 
Citation benchmark.. For each set of queries, a 
benchmark was generated from the 10 cited 
articles that contained the greatest number of co-
citations in common with the query. For the 
benchmark, the average number of cited articles 
that have more than 9 co-citations was 15.70          
+ 6.58 (mean + S.D.). Query sets were checked to 
confirm that at least one sentence in each abstract 
was classified per argumentative class. 
3.2 Metrics  
The main measure for assessing information 
retrieval engines is mean average precision (MAP). 
MAP is the standard metric although it may tend to 
hide minor differences in ranking (Mittendorf and 
Sch?uble, 1996). 
3.3 Text indexing 
For indexing, we used the easyIR system1, which 
implements standard vector space IR schemes 
(Salton et al, 1983). The term-weighting schema

composed of combinations of term frequency, 
inverse document frequency and length 
normalization was varied to determine the most 
relevant output ranking. Table 1 gives the most 
common term weighting factors (atc.atn, ltc.atn); 
the first letter triplet applies to the document, the 
second letter triplet applies to the query (Ruch, 
2002). 
 
Table 1. Weighting parameters, following SMART 
conventions. 
3.4 Argumentative classification 
The classifier segmented the abstracts into 4 
argumentative moves: PURPOSE, METHODS, 
RESULTS, and CONCLUSION. 
Figure 3: The classification results for the abstract shown 
in Figure 1.  In each box, the attributed class is first, 
followed by the score for the class, followed by the 
extracted text segment. In this example, one of RESULTS 
sentences is misclassified as METHODS 
 
The classification unit is the sentence which means 
that abstracts are preprocessed using an ad hoc 
sentence splitter. The confusion matrix for the four 
argumentative moves generated by the classifier is 
given in Table 2. This evaluation used explicitly 
structured abstracts; therefore, the argumentative 
markers were removed prior to the evaluation. 
Figure 3 shows the output from the classifier, when 
applied to the abstract shown in Figure 1. After 
extraction, each of the four types of argumentative 
moves was then used for indexing, retrieval and 
comparison tasks.

CONC 2.27% 0% 2.27% 95.45%
3.5 Argumentative combination 
We adjusted the weight of the four argumentative 
moves, based on their location and then combined 
them to improve retrieval effectiveness.  The query 
weights were recomputed as indicated in equation 
(1).  
 
Wnew = Wold * Sc * kc (1) 
 
c ? {PURPOSE; METHODS; RESULTS; 
CONCLUSION} 
Wold: the feature weight as given by the query 
weighting (ltc) 
S: the normalized score attributed by the 
argumentative classifier to each sentence in the 
abstract. This score is attributed to each feature 
appearing in the considered segment 
CONCLUSION |00160116| The highly favorable pathologic 
stage (RI-RII, 58%) and the fact that the majority of 
patients were alive and disease-free suggested a more 
favorable prognosis for this type of renal cell carcinoma. 
METHODS |00160119| Tumors were classified according to 
well-established histologic criteria to determine stage of 
disease; the system proposed by Robson was used. 
METHODS |00162303| Of 250 renal cell carcinomas 
analyzed, 36 were classified as chromophobe renal cell 
carcinoma, representing 14% of the group studied. 
PURPOSE |00156456| In this study, we analyzed 250 renal 
cell carcinomas to a) determine frequency of CCRC at our 
Hospital and b) analyze clinical and pathologic features of 
CCRCs. 
PURPOSE |00167817| Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma 
(CCRC) comprises 5% of neoplasms of renal tubular 
epithelium. CCRC may have a slightly better prognosis 
than clear cell carcinoma, but outcome data are limited. 
RESULTS |00155338| Robson staging was possible in all 
cases, and 10 patients were stage 1) 11 stage II; 10 stage 
III, and five stage IV. 
k: a constant for each value of c. The value is set 
empirically using the tuning set (TS). The initial 
value of k for each category is given by the 
distribution observed in Table 4 (i.e., 0.625, 0.164, 
0.176, 0.560 for the classes, PURPOSE, 
METHODS, RESULTS and CONCLUSION 
respectively), and then an increment step (positive 
and negative) is varied to get the most optimal 
combination. 
 
This equation combines the score (Sc) attributed by 
the original weighting (ltc) for each feature (Wold) 
found in the query with a boosting factor (kc). The 
boosting factor was derived from the score 
provided by the argumentative classifier for each 
classified sentence. For these experiments, the 
parameters were determined with a tuning set (TS), 
one of the four query sets, and the final evaluation 
was done using the remaining three sets, the 
validation sets (VS). The document feature factor 
(atn) remained unchanged. 
4 Results 
In this section, we described the generation of the 
baseline measure and the effects of different 
conditions on this baseline.

4.1 Comparison of text index parameters 
The use of a domain specific thesaurus tends to 
improve the MAP when compared to the citation 
benchmark, 0.1528 vs. 0.1517 for ltc.atn and 
0.1452 vs. 0.1433 for atc.atn (Table 3).  The ltc.atn 
weighting schema in combination with the 
thesaurus produced the best results, therefore these 
parameters were more likely to retrieve abstracts 
found in the citation index and thus were used for  
 all subsequent experiments.  
Table 3. Mean average precision (MAP) for each query set 
(1,2,3, and 4) with different term weighting schemas.  The 
last column gives the average MAP. T represents the 
thesaurus 
4.2 Argumentation-based retrieval 
For demonstrating that argumentative features can 
improve document retrieval, we first determined 
which argumentative class was the most content 
bearing.  Subsequently, we combined the four 
argumentative classes to again improve document 
retrieval.  
 
Table 4. MAP results from querying the collection using 
only the argumentative move. 
 
To determine the value of each argumentative 
move in the retrieval, the argumentative 
categorizer first parses each query abstract, 
generating four groups each representing a unique 
argumentative class. The document collection was 
separately queried with each group. Table 4 gives 
the MAP measures for each type of argumentation. 
Table 4 shows the sentences classified as 
PURPOSE provide the most useful content to 
retrieve similar documents. Baseline precision of 
62.5% is achieved when using only this section of 
the abstract. The CONCLUSION move is the 
second most valuable at 56% of the baseline. The 
METHODS and RESULTS sections appear less 
content bearing for retrieving similar documents, 
16.4% and 17.6%, respectively, of the baseline. 
Each argumentative set represents roughly a 
quarter of the textual content of the original 
abstract.   Querying with the PURPOSE section, 
(25% of the available textual material) realizes 
almost 2/3 of the average precision and for the 
CONCLUSION section, it is more than 50% of the 
baseline precision. In information retrieval queries 
and documents are often seen as symmetrical 
elements. This fact may imply the possible use of 
the argumentative moves as a technique to reduce 
the size of the indexed document collection or to 
help indexing pruning in large repositories (Carmel 
and al. 2001).  
4.3 Argumentative overweighting 
As implied in Table 4, Table 5 confirms that 
overweighting the features of PURPOSE and 
CONCLUSION sentences results in a gain in 
average precision (respectively +3.39% and +3.98 
for CONCLUSION and PURPOSE) as measured 
by citation similarity.  More specifically, Table 5 
demonstrates the use of PURPOSE and 
CONCLUSION as follows: 
 Set 1 Set 2 Set 3 Set 4 Average 
atc.atn 0.1402 0.1417 0.1438 0.1476 0.1433
atc.atn + T 0.1440 0.1431 0.1477 0.1465 0.1452
ltc.atn 0.1505 0.1528 0.1506 0.1529 0.1517
ltc.atn + T 0.1524 0.1534 0.1530 0.1539 0.1532  ? PURPOSE applies a boosting coefficient to 
features classified as PURPOSE by the 
argumentative classifier; 
? CONCLUSION applies a boosting coefficient 
to features classified as CONCLUSION by the 
argumentative classifier; 
? COMBINATION applies two different 
boosting coefficients to features classified as 
CONCLUSION and PURPOSE by the 
argumentative classifier. 
 
The results, in Table 5, from boosting PURPOSE 
and CONCLUSION features are given alongside 
the MAP and show an improvement of precision at 
the 5 and 10 document level. At the 5-document 
level the advantage is with the PURPOSE features, 
but at the 10-document level boosting the 
CONCLUSION features is more effective.  While 
the improvement brought by boosting PURPOSE 
and CONCLUSION features, when measured by 
MAP is modest (3-4%), the improvement observed 
by their optimal combination reached a significant 
improvement: + 5.48%. The various combinations 
of RESULTS and METHODS sections did not 
lead to any improvement.

Argumentation has typically been studied in 
relation to summarization (Teufel and Moens, 
2002). Its impact on information retrieval is more 
difficult to establish although recent experiments 
(Ruch et al, 2003) tend to confirm that 
argumentation is useful for information extraction, 
as demonstrated by the extraction of gene 
functions for LocusLink curation.  Similarly, using 
the argumentative structure of scientific articles 
has been proposed to reduce noise (Camon et al, 
2004) in the assignment of Gene Ontology codes 
as investigated in the BioCreative challenge. In 
particular, it was seen that the use of ?Material and 
Methods? sentences should be avoided.  A fact 
which is confirmed by our results with the 
METHOD argumentative move.

5 Conclusion and Future work 
We have reported on the construction of an 
information retrieval engine tailored to search for 
documents with similar citations in MEDLINE 
collections. The tool retrieves similar documents 
by giving more weight to features located in 
PURPOSE and CONCLUSION segments. The 
RESULTS and METHODS argumentative moves 
are reported here as less useful for such a retrieval 
task. Evaluated on a citation benchmark, the 
system significantly improves retrieval 
effectiveness of a standard vector-space engine.  In 
this context, it would be interesting to investigate 
how argumentation can be beneficial to perform ad 
hoc retrieval tasks in MEDLINE (Kayaalp et al, 
2003). 
 
Evidently using citation information to build our 
benchmark raises some questions. Authors may 
refer to other work in many ways to benefit the 
tone of their argument.  Specifically, there are two 
major citation contexts, one where an article is 
cited negatively or contrastively and one where an 
article is cited positively, or the authors state that 
their own work originates from the cited work.  In 
this study we have not made a distinction between 
these contexts but we consider this as an avenue 
for building better representations of the cited 
articles in future work. Finally, we are now 
exploring the use of the tool to detect 
inconsistencies between articles.  We hope to use 
citation and content analysis to identify articles 
containing novel views so as to expose differences 
in the consensus of the research area?s intellectual 
focus. The idea is to retrieve documents having 
key citation similarity but show some dissimilarity 
regarding a given argumentative category.   
 
Finally, we have observed that citation networks in 
digital libraries are analogous to hyperlinks in web 
repositories.  Consequently using web-inspired 
similarity measures may be beneficial for our 
purposes. Of particular interest in relation to 
argumentation, is the fact that citations networks, 
like web pages, are hierarchically nested graph 
with argumentative moves introducing 
intermediate levels (Bharat et al, 2001).
