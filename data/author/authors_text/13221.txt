Abstract
Whereas multilingual comparable corpora
have been used to identify translations of
words or terms, monolingual corpora can
help identify paraphrases. The present
work addresses paraphrases found be-
tween two different discourse types: spe-
cialized and lay texts. We therefore built
comparable corpora of specialized and lay
texts in order to detect equivalent lay and
specialized expressions. We identified two
devices used in such paraphrases: nomi-
nalizations and neo-classical compounds.
The results showed that the paraphrases
had a good precision and that nominaliza-
tions were indeed relevant in the context of
studying the differences between special-
ized and lay language. Neo-classical com-
pounds were less conclusive. This study
also demonstrates that simple paraphrase
acquisition methods can also work on texts
with a rather small degree of similarity,
once similar text segments are detected.
1 Introduction
Comparable corpora refer to collections of texts
sharing common characteristics. Very often com-
parable corpora consist of texts in two (or more)
languages that address the same topic without be-
ing translations of each other. But this notion
also applies to monolingual texts. In a mono-
lingual context, comparable corpora can be texts
from different sources (such as articles from var-
ious newspapers) or from different genres (such
as specialized and lay texts) but dealing with the
same general topic. Comparable corpora have
been used to perform several Natural Language
Processing tasks, such as extraction of word trans-
lations (Rapp, 1995; Chiao and Zweigenbaum,
2002) in a multilingual context or acquisition of
paraphrases (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Shinyama
and Sekine, 2003) in a monolingual context. In
this work1, we are interested in using comparable
corpora to extract paraphrases.
Paraphrases are useful to various applications,
including information retrieval (Ibrahim et al,
2003), information extraction (Shinyama and
Sekine, 2003), document summarization (Barzi-
lay, 2003) and text simplification (Elhadad and Su-
taria, 2007). Several methods have been designed
to extract paraphrases, many of them dealing with
comparable text corpora. A few paraphrase acqui-
sition approaches used plain monolingual corpora
to detect paraphrases, such as (Jacquemin, 1999)
who detects term variants or (Pasca and Dienes,
2005) who extract paraphrases from random Web
documents. This type of corpus does not insure
the actual existence of paraphrases and a majority
of methods have relied on corpora with a stronger
similarity between the documents, thus likely to
provide a greater amount of paraphrases. Some
paraphrase approaches used monolingual paral-
lel corpora, i.e. different translations or versions
of the same texts. For instance (Barzilay and
McKeown, 2001) detected paraphrases in a corpus
of English translations of literary novels. How-
ever such corpora are not easily available and ap-
proaches which rely instead on other types of cor-
pora are actively investigated.
Bilingual parallel corpora have been exploited
for acquiring paraphrases in English (Bannard and
Callison-Burch, 2005) and French (Max, 2008).
Comparable corpora are another useful source of
paraphrases. In this regard, only closely related
corpora have been used, especially and almost ex-
clusively corpora of news sources reporting the

in (Del?ger and Zweigenbaum, 2008a) and (Del?ger and
Zweigenbaum, 2008b), more specifically, a new corpus is
added, an additional type of paraphrase (based on neo-
classical compounds) is extracted and the evaluation is more
relevant.

same events. (Barzilay and Lee, 2003) gener-
ated paraphrase sentences from news articles us-
ing finite state automata. (Shinyama and Sekine,
2003) extracted paraphrases through the detection
of named entities anchors in a corpus of Japanese
news articles. In the medical domain, (Elhadad
and Sutaria, 2007) worked with a comparable, al-
most parallel, corpus of medical scientific articles
and their lay versions to extract paraphrases be-
tween specialized and lay languages.
We aim at detecting paraphrases in medical cor-
pora in the same line as (Elhadad and Sutaria,
2007) but for French. This type of paraphrases
would be a useful resource for text simplification
or to help authoring medical documents dedicated
to the general public. However, in a French medi-
cal context, it is difficult to obtain comparable cor-
pora of documents with a high level of similarity,
such as pairs of English scientific articles and their
translations in lay language, or news articles re-
porting the same events used in general language
(Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Shinyama and Sekine,
2003). Therefore, in addition to using this type
of comparable corpora, we also tried to rely on
corpora with less similarity but more easily avail-
able documents: lay and specialized documents
from various sources dealing with the same overall
medical topic.
We describe our experiment in building and ex-
ploiting these corpora to find paraphrases between
specialized and lay language. Issues at stake in-
volve: (i) how to collect corpora as relevant as
possible (Section 2.1); (ii) how to identify pas-
sages which potentially convey comparable in-
formation (Section 2.2); and (iii) what sorts of
paraphrases can be collected between these two
types of discourse, which is addressed in Sec-
tion 2.3, through the identification of two kinds
of paraphrases: nominalization paraphrases and
paraphrases of neo-classical compounds. An eval-
uation of the method (Section 2.4) is conducted
and results are presented (Section 3) and discussed
(Section 4).
2 Material and Methods
2.1 Building comparable corpora of lay and
specialized texts
Today, a popular way of acquiring a corpus is col-
lecting it from the Web (Kilgarriff and Grefen-
stette, 2003), as it provides easy access to an un-
limited amount of documents. Here we focus
on monolingual comparable corpora of special-
ized and lay medical French documents, with the
objective of identifying correspondences between
the two varieties of languages in these documents.
We collected three corpora from the Web dealing
with the following three topics: nicotine addiction,
diabetes and cancer.
When dealing with a Web corpus several is-
sues arise. The first one is the relevance of
the documents retrieved to the domain targeted
and is highly dependant on the method used to
gather the documents. Possible methods include
querying a general-purpose search engine (such
as Google) with selected key words, querying a
domain-specific search engine (in domains where
they exist) indexing potentially more relevant and
trustworthy documents, or directly downloading
documents from known relevant websites. An-
other important issue specific to our type of cor-
pus is the relevance to the genre targeted, i.e. lay
vs. specialized. Hence the need to classify each
collected document as belonging to one genre or
the other. This can be done by automatic cate-
gorisation of texts or by direct knowledge of the
sources of documents. In order to obtain a corpus
as relevant as possible to the domain and to the
genres, we used direct knowledge and restricted
search for selecting the documents. In the case of
the cancer topic, we had knowledge of a website
containing comparable lay and specialized docu-
ments: the Standards, Options: Recommandations
website2 which gives access to guidelines on can-
cer for the medical specialists on the one hand and
guides for the general public on the same topics on
the other hand. This case was immediate: we only
had to download the documents from the website.
This corpus is therefore constituted of quite sim-
ilar documents (professional guidelines and their
lay versions). The other two corpora (on nico-
tine addiction and diabetes), however, were built
from heterogeneous sources through a restricted
search and are less similar. We first queried two
health search engines (the health Web portals CIS-
MeF3 and HON4) with key words. Both allow
the user to search for documents targeted to a
population (e.g., patient-oriented documents). We
also queried known relevant websites for docu-
ments dealing with our chosen topics. Those were
2http://www.sor-cancer.fr/
3http://www.cismef.org/
4http://www.hon.ch/
3
French governmental websites, including that of
the HAS5 which issues guidelines for health pro-
fessionals, and that of the INPES6 which provides
educational material for the general public; as well
as health websites dedicated to the general pub-
lic, including Doctissimo7, Tabac Info Service8,
Stoptabac9 and Diab?te Qu?bec10.
The corpus dealing with the topic of diabetes
served as our development corpus for the first type
of paraphrases we extracted, the other two corpora
were used as test corpora.
Once collected, a corpus needs to be cleaned
and converted into an appropriate format to allow
further processing, i.e. extracting the textual con-
tent of the documents. HTML documents typi-
cally contain irrelevant information such as nav-
igation bars, footers and advertisements?referred
to as ?boilerplate??which can generate noise.
Boilerplate removal methods can rely on HTML
structure, visual features (placement and size of
blocks) and plain text features. We used HTML
structure (such as meta-information and density of
HTML tags) and plain text (such as spotting phone
and fax numbers and e-mails, as often appear at
the end of documents) to get rid of boilerplate.
2.2 Aligning similar text segments
We hypothesize that paraphrases will be found
more reliably in text passages taken from both
sides of our comparable corpora which address
similar topics. So, as a first step, we tried to re-
late such passages. We proceeded in three steps:
1. as multiple topics are usually addressed in
a single text, we performed topic segmenta-
tion on each text using the TextTiling (Hearst,
1997) segmentation tool. A segment may
consist of one or several paragraphs;
2. we then tried to identify pairs of text seg-
ments addressing similar topics and likely to
contain paraphrases. For this we used a com-
mon, vector-based measure of text similarity:
the cosine similarity measure which we com-
puted for each pair of topic segments in the
cross-product of both corpus sides (each seg-
ment was represented as a bag of words);

8http://www.tabac-info-service.fr/
9http://www.stop-tabac.ch/
10http://www.diabete.qc.ca/
3. we selected the best text segment pairs, that
is the pairs with a similarity score equal or
superior to 0.33, a threshold we determined
based on the results of a preliminary study
(Del?ger and Zweigenbaum, 2008a).
2.3 Extracting paraphrases
We are looking for paraphrases between two vari-
eties of language (specialized and lay), as opposed
to any kind of possible paraphrases. We there-
fore endeavoured to determine what kind of para-
phrases may be relevant in this regard. A com-
mon hypothesis (Fang, 2005) is that specialized
language uses more nominal constructions where
lay language uses more verbs instead. We test this
hypothesis and build on it to detect specialized-lay
paraphrases around noun-to-verb mappings (a first
version of this work was published in (Del?ger and
Zweigenbaum, 2008b)). A second hypothesis is
that medical language contains a fair proportion of
words from Latin and Greek origins, which are re-
ferred to as neo-classical compounds. The mean-
ing of these words may be quite obscure to non-
experts readers. So one would expect to find less
of these words in lay texts and instead some sort
of paraphrases in common language. We therefore
tried to detect these paraphrases as a second type
of specialized vs. lay correspondences.
2.3.1 Paraphrases of nominalizations
A first type of paraphrases we tried to extract
was paraphrases between nominal constructions
in the specialized side (such as treatment of the
disease) and verbal constructions in the lay side
(such as the disease is treated). This type of para-
phrases involves nominalizations of verbal phrases
and is built around the relation between a dever-
bal noun (e.g. treatment) and its base verb (e.g.
treat). Therefore, we relied on a lexicon of French
deverbal nouns paired with corresponding verbs
(Hathout et al, 2002) to detect such pairs in the
corpus segments. These noun-verb pairs served as
anchors for the detection of paraphrases. In order
to design paraphrasing patterns we extracted all
pairs of deverbal noun and verb with their contexts
from the development corpus. The study of such
pairs with their contexts allowed us to establish a
set of lexico-syntactic paraphrasing patterns11. An
example of such patterns can be seen in Table 1.

Table 1: Example paraphrasing patterns (a shared
index indicates equality or synonymy. N=noun,
V=verb, A=adjective, PREP=preposition,
DET=determiner, 1 in index = pair of dever-
bal noun and verb)
The general method was to look for correspond-
ing content words (mainly noun and adjective) in
the contexts. We defined corresponding words as
either equal or synonymous (we used lexicons of
synonyms as resources12). Equals may have ei-
ther the same part-of-speech, or different parts-of-
speech, in which case stemming13 is performed to
take care of derivational variation (e.g., medicine
and medical). We then applied the patterns to both
development and test corpora.
The patterns thus designed are close to the
transformation rules of (Jacquemin, 1999) who
detects morpho-syntactico-semantic variants of
terms in plain monolingual corpora. One dif-
ference is that our patterns are built around one
specific type of morphological variation (noun to
verb variation) that seemed relevant in the context
of the specialized/lay opposition, as opposed to
any possible variation. We also identify the para-
phrases by comparing the two sides of a compara-
ble corpus while (Jacquemin, 1999) starts from a
given list of terms and searches for their variants
in a plain monolingual corpus. Finally, we do not
apply our method on terms specifically but on any
expression corresponding to the patterns.
2.3.2 Paraphrases of neo-classical
compounds
We then extracted paraphrases of neo-classical
compounds as a second type of paraphrases that
seemed relevant to the opposition between lay
and specialized languages. This means that we
looked for neo-classical compounds on one side
of the corpora and equivalents in modern lan-
guage on the other side. To do this we relied
on the morphosemantic parser D?riF (Namer and
12The lexicons used came from the Masson and Robert dic-
tionaries.
13Stemming was performed using the Lingua::Stem
perl package (http://search.cpan.org/~snowhare/
Lingua-Stem-0.83) which is similar to the Snowball
stemmers (http://snowball.tartarus.org)
Zweigenbaum, 2004). D?riF analyzes morpholog-
ically complex words and outputs a decomposi-
tion of those words into their components and a
definition-like gloss of the words according to the
meaning of the components in modern language
when they are from Greek or Latin origins. For
instance the French word gastrite (gastritis) is de-
composed into gastr+ite and its gloss is inflamma-
tion de l?estomac (inflammation of stomach).
We first ran the analyzer on the specialized
side of the corpora to detect neo-classical com-
pounds. Then we searched for paraphrases of
those compounds based on the output of D?riF,
that is we looked for the modern-language equiva-
lents of the word components (in the case of gas-
tritis this means searching for inflammation and
stomach) close to each other within a syntactic
phrase (we empirically set a threshold of 4 words
as the maximum distance between the modern-
language translations of the components). A pat-
tern used to search those paraphrases is for in-
stance:
C ? ((DET)? N PREP)? (DET)? C1 W0?4 C2
where C is a neo-classical compounds in a spe-
cialized text segment, C1 and C2 are the modern-
language components of C, N is a noun, PREP a
preposition, DET a determiner and W an arbitrary
word.
2.4 Evaluation
We first evaluated the quality of the extracted para-
phrases by measuring their precision, that is, the
percentage of correct results over the entire re-
sults. We computed precision for each type of
paraphrases.
We then estimated recall for the first type
of paraphrases (nominalization paraphrases): the
percentage of correct extracted paraphrases over
the total number of paraphrases that should have
been extracted. We used as gold standard a ran-
dom sample of 10 segment pairs from which we
manually extracted paraphrases.
Finally, since we aim at detecting paraphrases
between lay and specialized languages, we also
looked at the relevance of the two types we chose
to extract. That is, we evaluated the coherence of
the results with our two initial hypotheses, which
are expected to apply when both a specialized text
segment and a lay text segment convey similar
information: (1) nominalizations are more often
used in specialized texts while lay texts tend to

(b) Ns ...regular use of tobacco concerned... Nl ...tobacco use is the first cause...
(c) Ns ...which goes with smoking cessation... Vl ...who wants to stop smoking...

replace them with verbs; (2) specialized texts use
more neoclassical compounds while lay texts give
a paraphrase in modern language.
To evaluate (1) we measured the conditional
probability P (Vl|Ns) that a nominalization pat-
tern Ns in a specialized segment be replaced by
a matching verbal pattern Vl in a corresponding
lay segment. These patterns are the paraphras-
ing patterns defined in Section 2.3.1 and exempli-
fied in Table 1. Table 2 gives examples of cases
taken into account when computing this probabil-
ity, i.e. cases where both text segments convey the
same information, as a nominalization in the spe-
cialized side and as a nominalization or a verbal
paraphrase in the lay side. Formally, the proba-
bility can be estimated by |ParNs?Vl ||ExpParNs?Vl | , where
|ParNs?Vl | is the number of correct extracted
paraphrases involving a nominalization in a spe-
cialized segment and a verbal construction in the
corresponding lay segment (case (c) of Table 2),
and |ExpParNs?Vl | the expected number of para-
phrases. The expected number of paraphrases cor-
responds to the total number of instances where
a specialized text segment contains a nominal-
ization and the corresponding lay segment con-
veys the same information, expressed either as a
nominalization or as a paraphrasing verbal con-
struction (cases (a), (b) and (c) of Table 2). It
is therefore computed as the sum of |ParNs?Vl |
and |ParNs?Nl |, the latter referring to the number
of occurrences where both the specialized and lay
segments match the same nominalization pattern,
i.e., instances where a paraphrase was expected
but did not occur (cases (a) and (b) of Table 2). For
instance use of tobacco on one side and tobacco
use on the other side, as in (b), is a case where
one would have expected a paraphrase such as to-
bacco is used. Note that matching allows the same
flexibility as described in Section 2.3.1 in terms
of synonyms and morphological variants. To test
whether this tendency of using verbal construc-
tions instead of nominalizations is indeed stronger
in lay texts we also measured the reverse, i.e. the
conditional probability P (Vs|Nl), given a nomi-
nalization pattern Nl in a lay segment, that it be
replaced with a matching verbal pattern Vs in the
corresponding specialized segment, computed as
|ParNl?Vs |
|ExpParNl?Vs |
. If our hypothesis is verified, this
reverse probability should be lower then the direct
probability.
In the same way, to evaluate (2) we measured
the conditional probability P (Ml|Cs) that a neo-
classical compound Cs in a specialized segment
be replaced by a modern-language equivalent Ml
in a corresponding lay segment. Table 3 gives ex-
amples of cases taken into account when comput-
ing this probability, that is cases where both text
segments convey the same information, as a neo-
classical compound in the specialized side and as
a neo-classical compound or a modern-language
paraphrase in the lay side. Formally, it can be
estimated by |ParCs?Ml ||ExpParCs?Ml | , where |ParCs?Ml |is the number of correct extracted paraphrases in-
volving a neo-classical compound in a specialized

3 Results
Table 4 gives size figures for each side (lay and
specialized) of the three corpora in terms of docu-
ments, words and segment pairs.
Evaluation of the quality of the extracted para-
phrases shows that precision is rather good for
both type of paraphrases (see Tables 5 and 6), al-
though the figures cannot be considered signica-
tive for paraphrases of compounds extracted in the
tobacco and cancer corpora given the small num-
ber of paraphrases (only 3 paraphrases in both
cases).

Table 9 displays results for the investigation on
the coherence of our first initial hypothesis that
specialized texts use nominalizations where lay
texts use verbal constructions. The conditional
probability that a nominalization be replaced with
a verbal construction is higher for nominalizations
in specialized texts than for the reverse direction,
which means that nominalizations in specialized
texts are indeed more likely to be replaced by
verbal constructions in lay texts than nominaliza-
tions in lay texts by verbal constructions in spe-
cialized texts. Results for the second hypothe-
sis (neo-classical compounds in specialized texts
tend to be replaced by modern-language equiva-
lents in lay texts) are given in Table 10. As for the
first hypothesis, the conditional probability for the
neo-classical compounds in the specialized texts is
higher, which seems to be coherent with the ini-
tial hypothesis. However, given the very small
number of paraphrases, we cannot draw a signi-
ficative conclusion as regards this second type of
paraphrases.
4 Discussion
In this work we built comparable corpora of spe-
cialized and lay texts on which we implemented
simple paraphrase acquisition methods to extract
certain types of paraphrases that seemed rele-
vant in the context of specialized and lay lan-
guage: paraphrases based on nominalization vs.
verbal constructions and paraphrases based on
neo-classical compounds vs. modern-language ex-
pressions. The precision measured on the set of
detected paraphrases is rather good, which indi-
cates good quality of the paraphrases (hence of the
paraphrasing patterns and extracted segments).
An originality of this work lies in the fact
that, in contrast to approaches working with more
closely related comparable corpora (Barzilay and
Lee, 2003; Shinyama and Sekine, 2003; Elhadad
and Sutaria, 2007), we also gathered comparable
corpora of documents which, although addressing
the same general topics (nicotine addiction, dia-
betes), were a priori rather different since coming
from various sources and targeted to different pop-
ulations. We showed that simple paraphrase ac-
quisition methods could also work on documents
with a lesser degree of similarity, once similar seg-
ments were detected. Indeed the precision of the
extracted paraphrases is within the same range for
the three corpora we built, despite the fact that one
corpus (the cancer corpus) was composed of more
similar documents than the other two.
We extracted a type of paraphrases much less
exploited in existing work, with the exception of
(Elhadad and Sutaria, 2007), that is paraphrases
between specialized and lay language. This meant
that we had to take into account what kind of
paraphrases might be relevant, therefore the meth-
ods used to extract them were more constrained
and supervised than approaches aiming at detect-
ing any type of paraphrases. We based a part of
our work on the hypothesis that among relevant
types were paraphrases involving nominalizations
of verbal contructions, meaning that lay texts tend
to use verb phrases where specialized texts use
deverbal noun contructions. Our results seem to
support this hypothesis. Such paraphrases there-
fore seem to be interesting advice to give to au-
thors of lay texts. Future work includes testing
our method on English and comparing the results
for the two languages. We would expect them to
be fairly similar since the tendency to use nominal
constructions in scientific literature has also been
observed for English (Fang, 2005). The second
part of our work exploited the hypothesis that lay
texts use modern-language expressions where spe-
cialized texts use neo-classical compound words.
In this case, the paraphrases were too few to en-
able us to draw a significative conclusion. Testing
this method on different and larger corpora might
give more insight into the relevance of extracting
this type of paraphrases. As it is, this work is still
experimental and needs to be further investigated.

Table 10: Conditional probability for paraphrases of neo-classical compounds in both directions
Its major drawback is the low number of para-
phrases, in particular for the paraphrases of neo-
classical compounds which brought inconclusive
results. In order to gain insight on the low quan-
tity of paraphrases of neo-classical compounds,
we manually looked at sample text segments from
the nicotine addiction and cancer corpora (the
two corpora where very few paraphrases were ex-
tracted) and could not find any paraphrase of neo-
classical compounds. This would seem to indicate
that the low quantity of this type of paraphrases
is due to the characteristics of the corpora rather
than to defects of our extraction technique. As
for the nominalization paraphrase, even though the
method brought more paraphrases and gave en-
couraging results, their quantity is still quite small.
The recall computed on a sample of segment pairs
is low. This is mainly due to the fact that we set up
rather rectricted paraphrasing patterns. This was
done to ensure a high precision but caused the re-
call to fall. A future step would be to improve re-
call by modifying some aspects of the paraphras-
ing patterns while trying to keep a good precision.
Regardless of recall, the number of nominaliza-
tion paraphrases in itself is also small. This can
be due to the fact that we restrict ourselves to one
specific type of paraphrases, but also to the facts
that we first align and select similar text segments,
that the coverage of our corpora might not be suffi-
cient, and that we work on comparable corpora of
lesser similarity than other methods. Future work
to increase the number of paraphrases involves us-
ing clusters of text segments instead of pairs, in-
creasing the corpus sizes and developing methods
to detect other types of paraphrases besides the
two kinds investigated here.
5 Conclusion
We presented a method based on comparable med-
ical corpora to extract paraphrases between spe-
cialized and lay languages. We identified two
kinds of paraphrases, nominalization paraphrases
and paraphrases of neo-classical compounds, the
first type seeming to indeed reflect some of the
systematic differences between specialized and
lay texts while the second type brought too few
results to draw a signicative conclusion.
