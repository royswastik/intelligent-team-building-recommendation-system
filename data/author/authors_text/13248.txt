Abstract 
In this paper, we present the proposed me-
thod of participating SIGHAN-2010 Chi-
nese word segmentation bake-off. In this 
year, our focus aims to quick train and test 
the given data. Unlike the most structural 
learning algorithms, such as conditional 
random fields, we design an in-house devel-
opment conditional support vector Markov 
model (CMM) framework. The method is 
very quick to train and also show better per-
formance in accuracy than CRF. To give a 
fair comparison, we compare our method to 
CRF with three additional tasks, namely, 
CoNLL-2000 chunking, SIGHAN-3 Chi-
nese word segmentation. The results were 
encourage and indicated that the proposed 
CMM produces better not only accuracy but 
also training time efficiency. The official re-
sults in SIGHAN-2010 also demonstrates 
that our method perform very well in tradi-
tional Chinese with fine-tuned features set.  
1 Introduction 
Since 2006 Chinese word segmentation bakeoff 
in SIGHAN-3 (Levow, 2006), this is the third 
time to join the competition (Wu et al, 2006, 
2007). In this year, we join the SIGHAN bakeoff 
task in both traditional and simplified Chinese 
closed word segmentation.  Unlike most western 
languages, there is no explicit space between 
words. The goal of word segmentation is to iden-
tify words given the sentence. This technique 
provides important features for downstream pur-
poses. Examples include Chinese part-of-speech 
(POS) tagging (Wu et al, 2007), Chinese word 
dependency parsing (Wu et al, 2007, 2008). 
With the rapid growth of structural learning 
algorithms, such as conditional random fields 
(CRFs) (Lafferty et al, 2001) and maximum-
margin Markov models (M3N) (Taskar et al, 
2003) have received a great attention and be-
come a prominent learning algorithm to many 
sequential labeling tasks. Examples include part-
of-speech (POS) tagging (Shen et al, 2007) and 
syntactic phrase chunking (Suzuki et al, 2007). 
The Chinese word segmentation can also be 
treated as a character-based tagging task in (Xue 
and Converse, 2002). One feature of sequential 
labeling is that it aims at finding non-recursive 
chunk fragments in a given sentence. Among 
these approaches, CRF has been wildly used in 
recent SIGHAN bakeoff tasks (Jin and Chen, 
2008; Levow, 2006). 
Although these approaches do not suffer from 
so-called label-bias problems (Lafferty et al, 
2001), one limitation is that they are inefficient 
to train with large-scale, especially large catego-
ry data. On the other hand, non-structural learn-
ing approaches (e.g. maximum entropy models) 
which learn local predictors usually cost much 
better training time performance than structural 
learning algorithms. These methods condition on 
local context features and incorporate fix-length 
history information. Although higher order fea-
ture (longer history) maybe useful to some tasks, 
the exponential scaled inference time is also in-
tractable in practice.  
Support vector machines (SVMs) which is one 
of the state-of-the-art supervised learning algo-
rithms have been widely employed as local clas-
sifiers to many sequential labeling tasks (Taku 
and Matsumoto, 2001; Wu et al, 2006, 2008). 
Specially, the training time of linear kernel SVM 
with either L1-norm (Joachims, 2006; Keerthi et 
al., 2008) or L2-norm (Keerthi and DeCoste, 
2005; Hsieh et al, 2008) can now be obtained in 
linear time. Even local classifier-based ap-
proaches have the drawbacks of label-bias prob-
lems, training nonstructural linear SVM is scala-
ble to large-scale data. By means of so-called 
one-versus-all multiclass SVM training, it is also 
scalable to large-category data. 
In this paper, we present our Chinese word 
segmentation based on the proposed conditional 
support vector Markov models for sequential 
labeling tasks, especially Chinese word segmen-
tation. Unlike structural learning algorithms, our 
method can be simply trained without consider-
ing the entire structures and hence the training 
time scales linearly with the number of training 
examples. In this framework, to alleviate the ease 
of label-bias problems, the state transition proba-
bility is ignored. Instead, we merely utilize the 
property of label relationships between chunks 
(Wu et al, 2008). To demonstrate our method, 
we compare to several well-known structural 
learning algorithms, like CRF (Kudo et al, 2004), 
and SVM-HMM (Joachims et al, 2009) on two 
well-known data, namely, CoNLL-2000 syntac-
tic chunking, SIGHAN-3 Chinese word segmen-
tation tasks. By following this, we apply the 
model to the Chinese word segmentation tasks of 
SIGHAN-2010 this year. The empirical results 
showed that our method is not only fast but also 
achieving more superior accuracy than structural 
learning methods. In traditional Chinese, our me-
thod also achieves the state-of-the-art perfor-
mance in accuracy with fined-tune features. 
2 Conditional support vector Markov 
models 
Traditional conditional Markov models (CMM) 
is to assign the tag sequence which maximizes 
the observation sequence.

Viterbi algorithm.  
The graphic illustration of the K-th order left-

while equation (5) is the proposed greedy second

The above decompositions merge the transi-
tion and emission probability with single func-
tion. McCallum et al (2000) further combined 
the locally trained maximum entropy with the 
infered transition score. However, our condition-
al support vector Markov models make different 
chain probability. We replace the original transi-
tion probability with transition validity score, i.e.

The transition validity score is merely a Boo-
lean flag which indicates the relationships be-
tween two neighbor labels. Equation (6) and (7) 
are zero-order and our second order chain prob-
abilities. We will introduce the proposed infe-
rence algorithm and how to obtain the transition 
validity score automatically without concerning 
the change of chunk representation. 
2.1 Tag transitions  
In this paper, we do not explicitly adopt the state 
transitions for our CMM. Instead, a chunk-
relation pair is used. Nevertheless, one important 
property to sequential chunk labeling is that there 
is only one phrase type in a chunk. For example, 
if the previous word is tagged as begin of noun 
phrase (B-NP), the current word must not be end 
of the other phrase (E-VP, E-PP, etc). Therefore, 
we only model relationships between chunk tags 
to generate valid phrase structure.  
Wu et al (2007, 2008) presented an automatic 
chunk pair relation construction algorithm which 
can handle so-called IOB1/IOB2/IOE1/IOE2 
(Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001) chunk representa-
tion structures with either left-to-right or right-to-
left directions. Here, we extend this idea and ge-
neralize to fit to more chunk tags. That is we can 
model the S-tag, B2, B3 tags with dividing the 
leading tags into two categories. For details can 
refer the literatures. 
3 Empirical Results 
Three large-scale and large-category dataset is 
used to evaluate the proposed method, namely, 
CoNLL-2000 syntactic chunking (Tjong Kim 
Sang and Buchholz, 2000), Chinese POS tagging, 
and three of SIGHAN-3 word segmentation tasks. 
Table 1 shows the statistics of those datasets.  
CoNLL-2000 chunking task is a well-known 
and widely evaluated in many literatures (Suzuki 
et al, 2007; Ando and Zhang, 2005; Kudo and 
Matsumoto, 2001; Wu et al, 2008; Daum? III 
and Marcu, 2005). The training data was derived 
from Treebank WSJ section 15-18 while section 
20 was used for testing. The goal is to find the 
non-recursive phrase structures in a sentence, 
such as noun phrase (NP), verb phrase (VP), etc. 
There are 11 phrase types in this dataset. We fol-
low the previous best settings for SVMs (Kudo 
and Matsumoto, 2001; Wu et al, 2008). The 
IOE2 is used to represent the phrase structure 
and tagged the data with backward direction.  
The training and testing data of the Chinese 
POS tagging is mainly derived from the Aca-
demic Sinica?s balanced corpus (version 3.0). 
Seventy-five percent out of the data is used for 
training while the remaining 25% is used for test-
ing. However, the task of the Chinese POS tag-
ging is very different from classical English POS 
tagging in that there is no word boundary infor-
mation in Chinese text. To achieve this, Ng and 
Low (2004) gave a successful study on Chinese 
POS tagging. Just as English phrase chunking, 
the IOB-tags can be used to represent the Chi-
nese word and its part-of-speech tag. For exam-
ple, the tag B-ADJ means the first character of a 
Chinese word which POS tag is ADJ (adjective). 
n this task, we simply use the IOB2 to represent 
the chunk structure. In this way, the tagger needs 
to recognize the chunk tag by considering 118 
(59*2) categories at once.  
As discussed in (Zhou and Kit, 2007), using 
more complex chunk representation bring better 
segmentation accuracy in several Chinese word 
segmentation benchmarks. It is very useful in 
particular to represent long Chinese word (in par-
ticular proper nouns). By following this line, we 
apply the six tags B, BI, I, IE, E, and S to 
represent the Chinese word. BI and IE are the 
interior after begin and interior before end of a 
chunk. B/I/E/S tags indicate the be-
gin/interior/end/single of a chunk.  Figure 2 lists 
the used feature set in both experiments. 
3.1 Settings  
We included the Liblinear with square loss 
(Hsieh et al, 2008) into our conditional Markov 
models as classification algorithms. In basic, the 
SVM was designed for binary classification 
problems. To port to multiclass problems, we 
adopted the well-known one-versus-all (OVA) 
method. One good property of OVA is that pa-
rameter estimation process can be trained indivi-

probability output from SVM, we employ the 
sigmoid function with fixed parameter A=-2 and 
B=0 as (Platt, 1999).

score of the noun phrase only. The final two col-
umns list the entire training and testing times.  
As shown in Table 1, it is surprising that the 
proposed CMM outperforms the other structural 
learning methods, CRF and SVM-HMM. In 
terms of training time, our method shows sub-
stantial faster than CRF. However, in terms of 
testing time, our method is worse than CRF. The 
main reason is that we do not optimize the code 
and implementation. We trust this can be further 
improved.

CMM and the selected structural learning methods.

Table 2 shows the experimental results of the 
SIGHAN-3 bake-off tasks. We ran and con-
ducted the experiments with UPUC, MSRA, and 
CityU datasets. The final two rows in Table 5 list 
the top 1 and 2 scores of published papers.  
Here, the SVM-HMM still suffer from the sca-
lability problems. Similar to the findings in the 
Chinese POS tagging task, the zero-order CMM 
achieved the optimal accuracy among first-order, 
full second order and the proposed inference al-
gorithms. The training time is still very efficient 
for most CMMs. In comparison to CRF, our me-
thod did clearly perform better accuracy (ex-
cepted for the CityU) and require much less 
training time. For example, for the CityU dataset, 
our 0-order CMM took less than 15 minutes to 
train, while the CRF takes 4.34 hours in training. 
However, we observe that our CMM yielded 
better testing time speed than CRF in this task. 
We further exploit the trained SVM models and 
found that the produced weights were not as 
dense as CRF which produces many nonzero 
weights per category. In addition, we observed 
that our implementation worked very efficient in 
the small category tasks.  
For the three datasets, our method produced 
very competitive results as previous best ap-
proach which also made use of CRF as classifiers.  
Although we use the same techniques to de-
rive global features (assessor variety (AV) fea-
ture with 2~6 grams) from both training and test-
ing data, our CMMs and the conducted CRF 
could not perform as well as (Zhou and Kit, 
2007). In our experiments, both CRF and CMMs 
received the same training set. Hence the CRF 
and our CMMs is comparable in this experiment.

feature set should be improved. To achieve this, 
1/4 of the training data was used as development 
set, while the remaining 3/4 training data was 
used to train the classifier. Second, we combine 
multi-classifier to enhance the accuracy. The 
CRF and our CMM with basic feature set were 
trained to predict the initial labels of the testing 
data. Then the predicted labels were included as 
features to train the final-stage classifier. The 
final classifier is still our CMM. Third, the post-
processing method (Low et al, 2005) is em-
ployed to enhance the unknown word segmenta-
tion.  
Table 4 lists the empirical results of the devel-
opment set. By validate with development data, 
we found that C=1.25 and use the E-BIES repre-
sentation method (Wu et al, 2008) yields better 
accuracy than B-BIES (Zhou and Kit, 2007). 
Meanwhile, CRF seems to be suitable for B-
BIES representation method.  
The classifier parameters were fixed and then 
we try to search the optimal feature set via the 
incremental add-and-check method. That is, we 
use the initial feature set as basis and add one 
feature type from the pool and verify the good-
ness of the feature with the development data.  
Figure 3 figures out the used features of each 
pass. 
In this year, the process was completely run-
through for the traditional Chinese task. Unfor-
tunately we have insufficient time to apply the 
same technique to Simplified Chinese task. Table 
3 lists the official results in the SIGHAN 2010 
Chinese word segmentation bake-off.

4 Conclusion 
In this paper, we investigate the issues of sequen-
tial chunk labeling and present the conditional 
support vector Markov models for this purpose. 
The experiments were conducted with two well-
known datasets, includes CoNLL-2000 text 
chunking and SIGHAN-3 Chinese word segmen-
tation. The experimental results showed that our 
method scales very well while achieving surpris-
ing good accuracy than structural learning me-
thods. On the SIGHAN-3 task, the proposed me-
thod outperformed CRF, while substantially re-
duced the training time. We also apply such me-
thod to the SIGHAN-2010 traditional Chinese 
segmentation with fined tuned feature set. The 
result was also encouraged. Our approach ob-
tains the best accuracy in this task. In terms of 
Simplified Chinese, we achieve mid-rank place 
due to the very limited time-constraint. In the 
future, we plan to completely adopt this method 
to the Simplified Chinese word segmentation 
with the elaborated feature selection metrics and 
the same post-processing method.

conditional support vector Markov models can
