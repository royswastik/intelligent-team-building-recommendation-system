Abstract 
This paper proposes methods to 
pre-process questions in the postings 
before a QA system can find answers in a 
discussion group in the Internet.  
Pre-processing includes garbage text 
removal and question segmentation.  
Garbage keywords are collected and 
different length thresholds are assigned to 
them for garbage text identification.  
Interrogative forms and question types 
are used to segment questions.  The best 
performance on the test set achieves 
92.57% accuracy in garbage text removal 
and 85.87% accuracy in question 
segmentation, respectively. 
1 Introduction 
Question answering has been a hot research topic 
in recent years.  Large scale QA evaluation 
projects (e.g. TREC QA-Track1, QA@CLEF2, 
and NTCIR 3  QAC and CLQA Tracks) are 
helpful to the developments of question 
answering. 
However, real automatic QA services are not 
ready in the Internet.  One popular way for 
Internet users to ask questions and get answers is 
to visit discussion groups, such as Usenet 
newsgroups 4  or Yahoo! Answers 5 .  Each 
discussion group focuses on one topic so that 
users can easily find one to post their questions. 
There are two ways a user can try to find

3 http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/index-en.html 
4 Now they can be accessed via Google Groups: 
http://groups.google.com/ 
5 http://answers.yahoo.com/ 
answers.  You can post your question in a 
related discussion group and wait for other users 
to provide answers.  Some discussion groups 
provide search toolbars so that you can search 
your question first to see if there are similar 
postings asking the same question.  In Yahoo! 
Answers, you can also judge answers offered by 
other users and mark the best one. 
Postings in discussion groups are good 
materials to develop a FAQ-style QA system in 
the Internet.  By finding questions in the 
discussion groups similar to a new posting, 
responses to these questions can provide answers 
or relevant information. 
But without pre-processing, measuring 
similarity with original texts will arise some 
problems: 
1. Some phrases such as ?many thanks? or 
?help me please? are not part of a 
question.  These kinds of phrases will 
introduce noise and harm matching 
performance. 
2. Quite often there is more than one 
question in one posting.  If the question 
which is most similar to the user's 
question appears in an existed posting 
together with other different questions, it 
will get a lower similarity score than the 
one it is supposed to have because of 
other questions. 
Therefore, inappropriate phrases should be 
removed and different questions in one posting 
should be separated before question comparison. 
There is no research focusing on this topic.  
FAQ finders (Lai et al, 2002; Lytinen and 
Tomuro, 2002; Burke, 1997) are closely related 
to this topic.  However, there are differences 
between them.  First of all, questions in a FAQ 
set are often written in perfect grammar without 
16
garbage text.  Second, questions are often 
paired with answers separately.  I.e. there is 
often one question in one QA pair. 
There were some research groups who 
divided questions into segments.  Soricut and 
Brill (2004) chunked questions and used them as 
queries to search engines.  Saquete et al (2004) 
focused on decomposition of a complex question 
into several sub-questions.  In this paper, 
question segmentation is to identify different 
questions posed in one posting. 
2 Garbage Text Removal 
2.1 Garbage Texts 
Articles in discussion groups are colloquial.  
Users often write articles as if they are talking to 
other users.  For this reason, phrases expressing 
appreciation, begging, or emotions of writers are 
often seen in the postings.  For example: 
?? powerpoint ?? ?????? 1 ?
??? access ???????????? 
?? 2 
(About Powerpoint, I?d like to ask1, how to 
put the whole window seen in Access onto a 
slide?  Thank you2!) 
The phrases ???????? (?I?d like to ask?) 
and ???? (?Thank you?) are unimportant to the 
question itself. 
These phrases often contain content words, 
not stop words, and thus are hard to be 
distinguished with the real questions.  If these 
phrases are not removed, it can happen that two 
questions are judged ?similar? because one of 
these phrases appears in both questions. 
A phrase which contributes no information 
about a question is called garbage text in this 
paper and should be removed beforehand in 
order to reduce noise.  The term theme text is 
used to refer to the remaining text. 
After examining real querying postings, 
some characteristics of garbage texts are 
observed: 
1. Some words strongly suggest themselves 
being in a garbage text, such as ?thank? 
in ?thank you so much?, or ?help? in 
?who can help me?. 
2. Some words appear in both theme texts 
and garbage texts, hence ambiguity 
arises.  For example: 
?????? (Any expert please help) 
?????? (Flash Expert) 
The first phrase is a garbage text, while 
the second phrase is a product name.  
The word ?expert? suggests an existence 
of a garbage text but not in all cases. 
Because punctuation marks are not reliable in 
Chinese, we use sentence fragment as the unit to 
be processed.  A sentence fragment is defined 
to be a fragment of text segmented by commas, 
periods, question marks, exclamation marks, or 
space marks.  A space mark can be a boundary 
of a sentence fragment only when both 
characters preceding and following the space 
mark are not the English letters, digits, or 
punctuation marks. 
2.2 Strategies to Remove Garbage Texts 
Frequent terms seen in garbage texts are 
collected as garbage keywords and grouped into 
classes according to their meanings and usages.  
Table 1 gives some examples of classes of 
garbage keywords collected from the training set. 
Class Garbage Keywords 
Please ????, ??,????? 
Thanks ??,??,??,??? 
Help ??,??,????,??? 
Urgent ??,??,??,?? 
Table 1. Some Classes of Garbage Keywords 
To handle ambiguity, this paper proposes a 
length information strategy to determine garbage 
texts as follows: 
If a sentence fragment contains a garbage 
keyword and the length of the fragment after 
removing the garbage keyword is less than a 
threshold, the whole fragment will be judged as a 
garbage text.  Otherwise, only the garbage 
keyword itself is judged as garbage text if it is 
never in an ambiguous case. 
Different length thresholds are assigned to 
different classes of garbage keywords.  If more 
than one garbage keyword occurring in a 
fragment, discard all the keywords first, and then 
compare the length of the remaining fragment 
with the maximal threshold among the ones 
corresponding to these garbage keywords. 
In order to increase the coverage of garbage 
keywords, other linguistic resources are used to 
expand the list of garbage keywords.  
Synonyms in Tongyici Cilin (?????), a 
17
thesaurus of Chinese words, are added into the 
list.  More garbage keywords are added by 
common knowledge. 
3 Question Segmentation 
When a user posts an article in a discussion 
group, he may pose more than one question at 
one time.  For example, in the following 
posting: 
Office 2003 ? XP????????? ?
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
???????????? 
(Office 2003 and XP ?  What are the 
differences between them? Which 
version is newer? What is the latest 
version???????????) 
there are 3 questions submitted at a time.  If a 
new user wants to know the latest version of 
Office, responses to the previous posting will 
give answers. 
Table 2 lists the statistics of number of 
questions in the training set.  The first column is 
the number of questions in one posting.  The 
second and the third columns are the number and 
the percentage of postings which contain such 
number of questions, respectively. 
Q# Post# Perc (%) 
1 494 56.98 
2 259 29.87 
3 82 9.46 
4 22 2.54 
5 4 0.46 
? 6 6 0.69 
? 2 373 43.02 
Total 867 100.00 
Table 2. Statistics of Number of Questions 
in Postings  
As we can see in Table 2, nearly half (43.02%) of 
the postings contain two or more questions.  
That is why question segmentation is necessary. 
3.1 Characteristics of Questions in a Posting 
Several characteristics of question texts in 
postings were found in real discussion groups: 
1. Some people use ??? (question mark) at 
the end of a question while some people 
do not.  In Chinese, some people even 
separate sentences only by spaces 
instead of punctuation marks.  (Note 
that there is no space mark between 
words in Chinese text.) 
2. Questions are usually in interrogative 
form.  Either interrogatives or question 
marks appear in the questions. 
3. One question may occur repeatedly in 
the same posting.  It is often the case 
that a question appears both in the title 
and in the content.  Sometimes a user 
repeats a sentence several times to show 
his anxiety. 
4. One question may be expressed in 
different ways in the same posting.  The 
sentences may be similar.  For example: 
A: Office2000????????12?
??? 
B: Office2000????????12?
??? 
(Can the clipboard of Office2000 only 
keep 12 items?) 
???? and ???? are synonyms in the 
meaning of ?keep?. 
Dissimilar sentences may also refer 
to the same question.  For example, 
(1) How to use automatic text 
wrapping in Excel? 
(2) If I want to put two or more lines in 
one cell, what can I do? 
(3) How to use it? 
These three sentences ask the same 
question: ?How to use automatic text 
wrapping in Excel??  The second 
sentence makes a detailed description of 
what he wants to do.  Topic of the third 
sentence is the same as the first sentence 
hence is omitted.  Topic ellipsis is quite 
often seen in Chinese. 
5. Some users will give examples to 
explain the questions.  These sentences 
often start with phrases like ?for 
example? or ?such as?. 
3.2 Strategies to Separate Questions 
According to the observations in Section 3.1, 
several strategies are proposed to separate 
questions: 
 
18
(1) Separating by Question Mark (???) 
It is the simplest method.  We use it as a 
baseline strategy. 
(2) Identifying Questions by Interrogative 
Forms 
Questions are usually in interrogative forms 
including subject inversion (?is he??, ?does 
it??), using interrogatives (?who is??), or a 
declarative sentence attached with a question 
mark (?Office2000 is better??).  Only the 
third form requires a question mark.  The 
first two forms can specify themselves as 
questions by text only. Moreover, there are 
particles in Chinese indicating a question as 
well, such as ??? or ???. 
If a sentence fragment is in interrogative 
form, it will be judged as a question and 
separated from the others.  A fragment not 
in interrogative form is merged with the 
nearest question fragment preceding it (or 
following it if no preceding one).  Note that 
garbage texts have been removed before 
question separation. 
(3) Merging or Removing Similar Sentences 
If two sentence fragments are exactly the 
same, one of them will be removed.  If two 
sentence fragments are similar, they are 
merged into one question fragment. 
Similarity is measured by the Dice 
coefficient (Dice, 1945) using weights of 
common words in the two sentence 
fragments.  The similarity of two sentence 
fragments X and Y is defined as follows: 
( ) ( )( ) ( )??
?
??
??
+
?
=
YtXw
YXk
tWtwWt
kWt
YXSim
2
,  (1) 
where Wt(w) is the weight of a word w.  In 
Equation 1, k is one of the words appearing 
in both X and Y.  Fragments with similarity 
higher than a threshold are merged together. 
The weight of a word is designed as the 
weight of its part-of-speech as listed in Table 
3.  Nouns and verbs have higher weights, 
while adverbs and particles have lower 
weights.  Note that foreign words are 
assigned a rather high weight, because names 
of software products such as ?Office? or 
?Oracle? are often written in English, which 
are foreign words with respect to Chinese. 
POS Weight
Vt (Transitive Verb), 
FW (Foreign Word) 100 
N (Noun) 90 
Vi (Intransitive Verb) 80 
A (Adjective) 40 
ADV (Adverb), ASP (Tense), 
C (Connective), DET (Determiner), 
P (Preposition), T (Particle) 
0 
Table 3. Weights of Part-of-Speeches 
Before computing similarity, word 
segmentation is performed to identify words 
in Chinese text.  After that, a part-of-speech 
tagger is used to obtain POS information of 
each word. 
(4) Merging Questions with the Same Type 
The information of question type has been 
widely adopted in QA systems (Zhang and 
Lee, 2003; Hovy et al, 2002; Harabagiu et 
al., 2001).  Question type often refers to the 
possible type of its answer, such as a person 
name, a location name, or a temporal 
expression.  The question types used in this 
paper are PERSON, LOCATION, REASON, 
QUANTITY, TEMPORAL, COMPARISON, 
DEFINITION, METHOD, SELECTION, 
YESNO, and OTHER.  Rules to determine 
question types are created manually. 
This strategy tries to merge two question 
fragments of the same question type.  This 
paper proposes two features to determine the 
threshold to merge two question fragments: 
length and sum of term weights of a fragment.  
Length is measured in characters and term 
weights are designed as in Table 3. 
Merging algorithm is as follows: if the 
feature value of a question fragment is 
smaller than a threshold, it will be merged 
into the preceding question fragment (or the 
following fragment if no preceding one).  
This strategy applies recursively until no 
question fragment has a feature value lower 
than the threshold. 
(5) Merging Example Fragments 
If a fragment starts with a phrase such as ?for 
example? or ?such as?, it will be merged into 
its preceding question fragment.

4 Experiments 
4.1 Experimental Data 
All the experimental data were collected from 
Yahoo! Knowledge+ (Yahoo!???? +) 6 , 
discussion groups similar to Yahoo! Answers but 
using Chinese instead of English. 
Three discussion groups, ?Business 
Application? (????), ?Website Building? 
(????), and ?Image Processing? (????), 
were selected to collect querying postings.  The 
reason that we chose these three discussion 
groups was their moderate growing rates.  We 
could collect enough amount of querying 
postings published in the same period of time. 
The following kinds of postings were not 
selected as our experimental data: 
1. No questions inside 
2. Full of algorithms or program codes 
3. Full of emoticons or Martian texts (??
?, a funny term used in Chinese to refer 
to a writing style that uses words with 
similar pronunciation to replace the 
original text) 
4. Redundant postings 
Totally 598 querying postings were collected as 
the training set and 269 postings as the test set.  
The real numbers of postings collected from each 
group are listed in Table 4, where ?BA?, ?WB?, 
and ?IP? stand for ?Business Application?, 
?Website Building?, and ?Image Processing?, 
respectively. 
Group BA WB IP 
Training Set 198 207 193 
Test Set 101 69 99 
Table 4. Numbers of Postings in the Data Set 
Two persons were asked to mark garbage texts 
and separate questions in the whole data set.  If 
a conflicting case occurred, a third person (who 
was one of the authors of this paper) would solve 
the inconsistency. 
4.2 Garbage Texts Removal 
The first factor examined in garbage text 
removal is the length threshold.  Table 5 lists 
the experimental results on the training set and 
                                                     
6 http://tw.knowledge.yahoo.com/ 
Table 6 on the test set.  All garbage keywords 
are collected from the training set. 
Eight experiments were conducted to use 
different values as length thresholds.  The 
strategy Lenk sets the length threshold to be k 
characters (no matter in Chinese or English).  
Hence, Len0 is one baseline strategy which 
removes only the garbage keyword itself.  LenS 
is the other baseline strategy which removes the 
whole sentence fragment where a garbage 
keyword appears. 
The strategy Heu uses different length 
thresholds for different classes of garbage 
keywords.  The thresholds are heuristic values 
after observing many examples in the training 
set. 
Accuracy is defined as the percentage of 
successful removal.  In one posting, if all real 
garbage texts are correctly removed and no other 
text is wrongly deleted, it counts one successful 
removal. 
Strategy Accuracy (%) 
Len0 64.21 
LenS 27.59 
Len1 73.91 
Len2 78.43 
Len3 80.60 
Len4 78.26 
Len5 71.91 
Heu 99.67 
HeuExp 99.67 
Table 5. Accuracy of Garbage Text Removal

Len1 69.52 
Len2 75.09 
Len3 75.46

Len5 65.80 
Heu 87.73 
HeuExp 92.57 
Table 6. Accuracy of Garbage Text Removal 
with Different Length Thresholds (Test Set) 
As we can see in both tables, the two baseline 
strategies are poorer than any other strategy.  It 
means that length threshold is useful to decide 
garbage existence. 
Heu is the best strategy (99.67% on the 
training set and 87.73% on the test set).  Len3 is 
20
the best strategy (80.60% on the training set and 
75.49% on the test set) among Lenk, but it is far 
worse than Heu.  We can conclude that the 
length threshold should be assigned individually 
for each class of garbage words.  If it is 
assigned carefully, the performance of garbage 
removal will be good. 
The second factor is the expansion of 
garbage keywords.  The strategy HeuExp is the 
same as Heu except that the list of garbage 
keywords was expanded as described in Section 
2.2. 
Comparing the last two rows in Table 6, 
HeuExp strategy improves the performance from 
87.73% to 92.57%.  It shows that a small 
amount of postings can provide good coverage of 
garbage keywords after keyword expansion by 
using available linguistic resources. 
The results of HeuExp and Heu on the 
training set are the same.  It makes sense 
because the expanded list suggests garbage 
existence in the training set no more than the 
original list does. 
4.3 Question Segmentation 
Overall Strategies 
Six experiments were conducted to see the 
performance of different strategies for question 
segmentation.  The strategies used in each 
experiment are: 
Baseline: using only ??? (question mark) to 
separate questions 
SameS: removing repeated sentence 
fragments then separating by ??? 
Interrg: after removing repeated sentence 
fragments, separating questions which 
are in interrogative forms 
SimlrS: following the strategy Interrg, 
removing or merging similar sentence 
fragments of the same question type 
ForInst: following the strategy SimlrS, 
merging a sentence fragment beginning 
with ?for instance? and alike with its 
preceding question fragment 
SameQT: following the strategy ForInst, 
merging question fragments of the same 
question type without considering 
similarity 
Table 7 and Table 8 depict the results of the six 
experiments on the training set and the test set, 
respectively.  The second column in each table 
lists the accuracy which is defined as the 
percentage of postings which are separated into 
the same number of questions as manually 
tagged.  The third column gives the number of 
postings which are correctly separated.  The 
fourth and the fifth columns contain the numbers 
of postings which are separated into more and 
fewer questions, respectively. 
Strategy Acc (%) Same More Fewer
Baseline 50.67 303 213 82
SameS 59.03 353 156 89
Interrg 64.88 388 204 6
SimlrS 75.08 449 141 8
ForInst 75.75 453 137 8
SameQT 88.29 528 13 57

Baseline 54.28 146 84 39
SameS 65.43 176 54 39
Interrg 65.43 176 93 0
SimlrS 74.35 200 68 1
ForInst 74.35 200 68 1
SameQT 85.87 231 16 22
Table 8. Accuracy of Question Segmentation 
by Different Strategies (Test Set) 
As we can see in Table 7, performance is 
improved gradually after adding new strategies.  
SameQT achieves the best performance with 
88.29% accuracy.  Same conclusion could also 
be made by the results on the test set.  SameQT 
is the best one with 85.87% accuracy. 
In Table 7, Baseline achieves only 50.67% 
accuracy.  That matches our observations: (1) 
one question is often stated many times by 
sentences ended with question marks in one 
posting (as 213 postings were separated into 
more questions); (2) some users do not use ??? in 
writing (as 82 postings were separated into fewer 
questions). 
SameS greatly reduces the cases (57 postings) 
of separation into more questions by removing 
repeated sentences. 
On the other hand, Interrg greatly reduces the 
cases (76 postings) of separation into fewer 
questions.  Many question sentences without 
question marks were successfully captured by 
detecting the interrogative forms. 
SimlrS also improves a lot (successfully 
reducing number of questions separated in 63 
postings).  But ForInst only improves a little.  
It is more common to express one question 
several times in different way than giving 
21
examples. 
SameQT achieves the best performance, 
which means that question type is a good strategy.  
Different ways to express a question are usually 
in the same question type.  Comparing with 
SimlrS which also considers sentence fragments 
in the same question type, more improvement 
comes from the successful merging of fragments 
with topic ellipses, co-references, or paraphrases.  
However, there may be other questions in the 
same question type which are wrongly merged 
together (as 49 failures in the training set). 
Considering the results on the test set, Interrg 
does not improve the overall performance 
comparing to SameS because the improvement 
equals the drop.  ForInst does not improve 
either.  It seems that giving examples is not 
common in the discussion groups. 
Thresholds in SameQT 
In the strategy SameQT, two features, length and 
sum of term weights, are used to determine 
thresholds to merge question fragments as 
mentioned in Section 3.2.  In order to decide 
which feature is better and which threshold value 
should be set, two experiments were conducted. 
LenThr Acc (%) LenThr Acc (%)
0 75.75 9 85.62 
3 76.25 10 86.62 
4 78.60 15 88.29

Figure 1. Accuracy of Question Segmentation

Table 9 depicts the experimental results of using 
length of sentence fragments as merging 
threshold.  The column ?LenThr? lists different 
settings of length threshold and the column 
?Acc? gives the accuracy. 
The performance is gradually improved as 
the value of length threshold increases.  The 
best one is LenThr=30 with 88.63% accuracy.  
However, ?Always Merging? (LenThr=?) 
achieves 88.29% accuracy, which is also 
acceptable comparing to the best performance.  
Fig 1 shows the curve of accuracy against length 
threshold. 
Table 10 presents the experimental results of 
using sum of term weights as merging thresold.  
The column ?WgtThr? lists different settings of 
length threshold and the column ?Acc? gives the 
accuracy. 
The performance is also gradually improved 
as the value of weight threshold increases.  
When WgtThr is set to be 500, 700, or 900, the 
performance is the best, with 88.46% accuracy.  
But the same as the threshold settings of length 
feature, the best one does not outperform 
?Always Merging? strategy (WgtThr=?, 88.29% 
accuracy) too much.  Fig 2 shows the curve of 
accuracy against similarity threshold.

From the results of above experiments, we can 
see that although using length feature with a 
22
threshold LenThr=30 achieves the best 
performance, ?Always Merging? is more 
welcome for a online system because no feature 
extraction or computation is needed with only a 
little sacrifice of performance.  Hence we 
choose ?Always Merging? as merging strategy in 
SameQT. 
5 Conclusion and Future Work 
This paper proposes question pre-processing 
methods for a FQA-style QA system on 
discussion groups in the Internet.  For a posting 
already existing or being submitted to a 
discussion group, garbage texts in it are removed 
first, and then different questions in it are 
identified so that they can be compared with 
other questions individually. 
An expanded list of garbage keywords is 
used to detect garbage texts.  If there is a 
garbage keyword appearing in a sentence 
fragment and the fragment has a length shorter 
than a threshold corresponding to the class of the 
garbage keyword, the fragment will be judged as 
a garbage text.  This method achieves 92.57% 
accuracy on the test set.  It means that a small 
set is sufficient to collect all classes of garbage 
keywords. 
In question segmentation, sentence fragments 
in interrogative forms are considered as question 
fragments.  Besides, repeated fragments are 
removed and fragments of the same question 
types are merged into one fragment.  The 
overall accuracy is 85.87% on the test set. 
In the future, performance of a QA system 
with or without question pre-processing will be 
evaluated to verify its value. 
New methods to create the list of garbage 
keywords more robotically should be studied, as 
well as the automatic assignments of the length 
thresholds of classes of garbage keywords. 
New feature should be discovered in the 
future in order to segment questions more 
accurately. 
Although the strategies and the thresholds are 
developed according to experimental data in 
Chinese, we can see that many of them are 
language-independent or can be adapted with not 
too much effort.
