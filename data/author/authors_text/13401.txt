Abstract
Semantic Networks (SN) are a knowledge representation paradigm especially
suited for the meaning representation of natural language expressions. In order
to clearly define their basic constructs, the relations and functions used in a se-
mantic network must be given a logical characterization. The paper exemplifies
this strategy for Multilayered Extended Semantic Networks (the so-called Multi-
Net paradigm). In particular, it is shown that the axioms characterizing the logical
properties of the expressional means of an SN have to be classified according to
different criteria which are connected with specific types of inference.
1 Introduction
Semantic Networks have a long tradition as a paradigm for representing cognitive struc-
tures, starting with Quillian [9]. As to the logical underpinning of relations and func-
tions used in such networks, we find a logically oriented and a more linguistically ori-
ented approach. The works in the first line, like Shapiro?s SNePS [10], and Brachmann?s
KL-ONE [1], have a clear logical foundation, but none of them give a systematic and
complete description of the relations and functions constituting an SN. By contrast, lin-
guistically oriented work normally discusses selected semantic relations (so-called cog-
nitive roles or theta-roles) in greater detail [5], however not on a formal logical level.
Moreover the proposed relations and roles are not contrasted with each other to form a
balanced system of expressional means. In SNePS [10], for example, the guideline for
choosing the appropriate relations is deliberately given the status of a recommendation
only. To meet the requirements on a knowledge representation formalism useful for NLP
(especially the universality, homogeneity, and interoperability criteria [4, Chap. 1]), one
needs a commitment on a clearly defined repertory of expressional means. Multilay-
ered Extended Semantic Networks (the MultiNet paradigm [4]) were designed to fulfill
these requirements, by fixing a set of expressional means and formalizing axioms which
describe these functions and relations. The formalism is comprehensively documented
and successfully used in NLP applications, e.g. for describing large semantically based
computational lexica [3], and as the backbone of NL interfaces [7]. Its application in the

InSicht question-answering system [2] has been successfully evaluated in CLEF 2004,
with a MultiNet knowledge base generated from 4,9 Mio sentences.
MultiNet extends simple semantic networks by the following features: (1) Every node is
labeled by a sort from a predefined ontology of sorts and by bundles of layer attributes.
(2) MultiNet admits functions and relations of arbitrary arity. (3) The arcs (relations)
are formally characterized by associated axioms. (4) Subnetworks can be encapsulated
to form concepts of higher order which can be connected to other concepts by relations
and functions. (5) The relationships in the network are assigned a knowledge type and
thus marked as categorically valid (c), prototypically valid (p), modally restricted (r), or
situationally bounded (s) with regard to each argument, as shown in Fig. 1.
2 The Expressional Means of MultiNet
To characterize an SN, we need a precise specification of the relations corresponding to
the arcs (links). Our formalism provides about 140 relations and functions characterized
on the basis of a uniform schema and by logical axioms. Table 1 sketches the relations
and functions needed in this paper. MultiNet distinguishes 45 sorts of conceptual enti-
ties used to define the signatures of relations and functions [4, Sect. 17.1]. Some of these
sorts are explained in Table 1. The sorts are also needed to constrain the applicability
of logical rules. For example, the law of double negation holds for semantically total
properties (sort [tq]) like dead and its negation alive, where not alive means the same as
dead. Another sort [gq] is used for gradable properties like friendly and unfriendly. Al-
though unfriendly means not friendly, the law of double negation does not hold in this
case, i.e. if someone is not unfriendly this does not mean that the person is friendly.
MultiNet not only classifies conceptual entities by their sorts but also by the values of

six so-called ?layer attributes?. Here we are concerned only with two of these attributes:
Facticity. We discern three kinds of facticity: [FACT=real ] for existing entities (Eiffel
tower), [FACT=non] for non-existing entities (the light ether), and [FACT=hypo] for
hypothetical entities (quarks). Apart from the extensional negation expressed by a non-
existing situation with [FACT=non], MultiNet supports the intensional negation of a
situation s, expressed by the relation (sMODL*NON). Both types occur in the example
shown in Fig. 1. Facticity must be anchored in the logical language since special infer-
ence rules apply to hypothetical and non-existing objects.
Genericity. The GENER attribute (degree of generality) divides the world of concepts
into generic objects with [GENER=ge] (house) and specific objects with [GENER=sp]
(?my house?). In this way, assertions about the generic concept can be clearly separated
from assertions about instances of that concept. Generic concepts are also needed to
model prototypical knowledge. Consider ?Lions feed on antelopes?. A modeling by
a universal quantifier ranging over all lions would be inadequate because the sentence
expresses only default knowledge.

3 A Typology of Axioms for Inferences over an SN
While a logical expression is either true or false in first-order logic (FOL), a semantic
formalism dealing with NL must support different degrees of reliability. Moreover, log-
ical calculi normally do not give a clue how to use the axioms in an effective inference
strategy. These considerations suggest the following cross-classification of axioms.
3.1 Conceptually Bound vs. Conceptually Non-bound Axioms
R-axioms. From a syntactical point of view, there are two types of expressions describ-
ing axiomatic knowledge. The first type contains no lexical constants but only relation
and function symbols (apart from logical signs). These expressions are called concep-
tually non-bound or R-Axioms. The following R-Axiom connects causality and time,
saying that effects never take place before the cause: (xCAUS y) ??(yANTE x) (1)
Other examples are given by axioms (4), (5), (7) below. Axioms which are conceptually
not bound have to be treated with care by the reasoner, since an R-axiom for a relation
R can be applied in inferences over the SN wherever R is involved (global effect). Inter
alia, R-axioms serve to express the symmetry or transitivity of relations, i.e. properties
which are difficult to handle efficiently.
B-axioms. Axioms containing the representative of at least one concept are called con-
ceptually bound or B-axioms. Thus, with every selling act s there is a buying act b
entailed by s. The corresponding relationship is given by the following axiom:
(sSUBS sell)? (sAGTa)? (sOBJo)? (sORNTd) ?
?b(bSUBSbuy)? (bOBJo)? (bAVRTa)? (bAGT d) (2)
Another example of a B-axiom is (6) which contains only one concept. Such B-axioms
have only a local effect, i.e. they are applied only in those cases where one concept
has to be connected to another during the inference process. Here, we meet the Frame
Problem in Artificial Intelligence: In a B-axiom like (2), only the change of participant
roles (like AGT, AFF, AVRT, and OBJ) is specified, but nothing is said about the local,
temporal and circumstantial embedding of the main situation (mainly represented by
LOC, TEMP, and CIRC, resp.) The transfer of these specifications must be handled by
axiom schemata for classes of concepts: While the temporal specification of a selling
act like s in (2) transfers unchanged to b, there is no such transfer of the specification
(s1 TEMP t1) of a sending act s1 to the corresponding receiving act s2 = sk(s1). For the
latter class we have:
(s1 SUBS ?send-act?)? (s1 TEMP t1)?
(sk(s1)SUBS ?receive-act?)? (sk(s1)TEMP t2) ? (t1 ANTE t2) (3)
3.2 Categorically vs. Prototypically Valid Axioms
Categorically Valid Axioms. It seems to be a contradiction to speak of axioms which
are restricted in their validity. But, if we want to formalize natural language semantics,
we must also account for prototypical regularities.
4
The following axiom expresses knowledge which is categorically valid:
(p1 COMPL p2) ? (oPROP p1)? (oPROP p2) (4)
Axiom (4) states that one from two complementary properties (if applicable at all) must
hold. It is obvious that there is no exception from this rule.
Prototypically Valid Axioms. By contrast, rule (5), governing the inheritance of the
part-whole relationship within the SUB hierarchy, has only the status of default (or pro-
totypically valid) knowledge:
(d1 SUBd2)? (d3 PARSd2) ??d4[(d4 SUBd3)? (d4 PARSd1)] (5)
It is a good assumption that a conceptual object subordinated to a generic object inherit
known parts from the latter. However, there are exceptions. While ships normally have
a keel, there are also ships which have not.
Categorically valid axioms lead to monotonic reasoning, while prototypically valid
axioms call for nonmonotonic reasoning. The standard approach to default reasoning
based on a truth-maintenance system does not scale up, though. In MultiNet, we warrant
that every deduction step involving a default again produces only default knowledge.
The newly generated default knowledge has to be checked for local contradictions in
a neighborhood of the concepts involved. Semantic networks can help defining such
neighborhoods as their link structure gives a natural notion of vicinity for concepts.
3.3 Deductive Axioms vs. Destructive Axioms
Deductive Axioms. Many axioms, like (1) through (5), can be used in a deductive
process to derive new knowledge, given by the conclusion, provided that the premise be
fulfilled. The important feature of monotonic deduction is that no piece of knowledge
in the knowledge base must ever be retracted.
Destructive Axioms. There are also axiomatic regularities which not only generate new
knowledge but also cancel earlier knowledge. Into this class of ?destructive? axioms we
number the derivation of the temporal end of a situation s:
(eSUBS end)? (eAFF s)? (eTEMP t) ? (sFIN t)|DEL (sTEMP_) (6)
Thus if an activity e ends a situation s at time t, then a new relation FIN for s must
be established and the earlier specification of s by the relation TEMP must be deleted.
While the first type of axioms can be treated by symbolic derivations, the latter type
requires actions on the knowledge base like deleting arcs.
3.4 Epistemically Restricted vs. Non-restricted Axioms
Epistemically Restricted Axioms. There are axioms which are epistemically restricted
in the sense that their validity is only warranted within a certain epistemic or cognitive
context. A typical example is the restricted transitivity of CAUS:
(k1 CAUS k2)? (k2 CAUS k3) ? (k1 CAUS k3) (7)
This axiom is connected with a fading effect preventing infinite prolongation of causal-
ity chains by a presumed (but not strongly valid) transitivity of CAUS. This effect is due
to the so-called INUS-conditions [8], i.e. humans asserting a causal relation emphasize
5
a certain cause and neglect other necessary conditions for this relationship.
Epistemically Non-restricted Axioms. For most axioms no epistemically motivated
restriction can be observed. In particular, the transitivity of conceptual subordination
(8) and of spatial inclusion (9) hold unconditionally:
(o1 SUBo2)? (o2 SUBo3) ? (o1 SUBo3) (8)
(oLOC (*INm))? (mLOC (*INn)) ? (oLOC (*INn)) (9)
For epistemically restricted axioms, we propose the use of built-in procedures which
treat borderlines of epistemic or functional levels by special parameters for controlling
the inference process.
4 Conclusion
The MultiNet formalism is intended for the semantic representation of unrestricted lan-
guage and thus supposed to represent the facticity status, degree of generality, modal
embedding, and other characteristics of NL concepts. The meaning of the relations
and functions on which the formalism is based, can be made precise by axioms which
capture their expected behaviour. These axioms differ with respect to the classificatory
dimensions of categoricity, conceptual boundedness, and epistemic restriction. We have
shown that these dimensions also affect the validity and efficiency of inference.
