Abstract 
This paper describes a complete syntactic 
analysis system based on multi-level 
chunking. On the basis of the correct se-
quences of Chinese words provided by 
CLP2010, the system firstly has a Part-of-
speech (POS) tagging with Conditional 
Random Fields (CRFs), and then does the 
base chunking and complex chunking with 
Maximum Entropy (ME), and finally gene-
rates a complete syntactic analysis tree. 
The system took part in the Complete Sen-
tence Parsing Track of the Task 2 Chinese 
Parsing in CLP2010, achieved the F-1 
measure of 63.25% on the overall analysis, 
ranked the sixth; POS accuracy rate of 
89.62%, ranked the third. 
1 Introduction 
Chunk is a group of adjacent words which belong 
to the same s-projection set in a sentence, whose 
syntactic structure is actually a tree (Abney, 1991), 
but apart from the root node, all other nodes are 
leaf nodes. Complete syntactic analysis requires a 
series of analyzing processes, eventually to get a 
full parsing tree. Parsing by chunks is proved to be 
feasible (Abney, 1994). 
The concept of chunking was first proposed by 
Abney in 1991, who defined chunks in terms of 
major heads, and parsed by chunks in 1994 (Ab-
ney, 1994). An additional chunk tag set {B, I, O} 
was added to chunking (Ramshaw and  Marcus, 
1995), which limited dependencies between ele-
ments in a chunk, changed chunking into a ques-
tion of sequenced tags, to promote the develop-
ment of chunking. Chunking algorithm was ex-
tended to the bottom-up parser, which is trained 
and tested on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of 
the Penn Treebank (Marcus, Santorini and Mar-
cinkiewicz 1993), and achieved a performance of 
80.49% F-measure, the results show that it per-
formed better than a standard probabilistic con-
text-free grammar, and can improve performance 
by adding the information of parent node (Sang, 
2000). 
On Chinese parsing, Maximum Entropy Model 
was first used to have a POS tagging and chunking, 
and then a full parsing tree was generated (Fung, 
2004), training and testing in the Penn Chinese 
Treebank, which achieved 79.56% F-measure. The 
parsing process was divided into POS tagging, 
base chunking and complex chunking, having a 
POS tagging and chunking on a given sentence, 
and then looping the process of complex chunking 
up to identify the root node (Li and Zhou, 2009). 
This parsing method is the basis of this paper. In 
addition, we have the existing Chinese chunking 
system in laboratory, which ranked first in Task 2: 
Chinese Base Chunking of CIPS-ParsEval-2009, 
so we try to apply chunking to complete syntactic 
analysis in CLP2010, to achieve better results. 
We will describe the POS tagging based on 
CRFs in Section 2, including CRFs, feature tem-
plate selection and empirical results. Multi-level 
chunking based on ME will be expounded in Sec-
tion 3, including ME, MEMM, base chunking and 
complex chunking. Finally, we will summarize our 
work in Section 4. 
 2 POS Tagging Based on CRFs 
2.1 Conditional Random Fields 
X is a random variable over data sequences to be 
labeled, and Y is a random variable over corres-
ponding label sequences. All components Yi of Y 
are assumed to range over a finite label alphabet. 
For example, X might range over natural language 
sentences and Y range over part-of-speech tags of 
those sentences, a finite label alphabet is the set of 
possible part-of-speech tags (Lafferty and McCal-
lum and Pereira, 2001). CRFs is represented by the 
local feature vector f and the corresponding weight 
vector, f is divided into the state feature s (y, x, i) 
and transfer feature t (y, y', x, i), where y and y' are 
possible POS tags, x is the current input sentence, i 
is the position of current term (Jiang and Guan and 
Wang, 2006). Formalized as follows: 
s (y, x, i) = s (yi, x, i)                      (1) 
? ?
? ?1, , , 1
, ,
0 1
i it y y x i i
t y x i
i
?? ??? ?
? ??
      (2) 
By the local feature of the formula (1) and (2), 
the global features of x and y: 
? ? ? ?, , ,iF y x f y x i??              (3) 
At this point of (X, Y), the conditional probabil-
ity distribution of CRFs: 
? ? ? ?? ?? ?
exp ,| F Y Xp Y X Z X? ?
?
?
?       (4) 
where ? ? ? ?? ?exp ,yZ x F y x? ?? ??  is a fac-
tor for normalizing. For the input sentence x, the 
best sequence of POS tagging: 
? ?arg max |
y
y p y x?? ?
 
2.2 Feature Template Selection 
We use the template as a baseline which is taken 
by Yang (2009) in CIPS-ParsEval-2009, directly 
testing the performance, whose accuracy was 
93.52%. On this basis, we adjust the feature tem-
plate through the experiment, and improve the 
tagging accuracy of unknown words by introduc-
ing rules, in the same corpus for training and test-
ing, accuracy is to 93.89%. Adjusted feature tem-
plate is shown in Table 1, in which the term pre is 
the first character in current word, suf is the last 
character of current word, num is the number of 
characters of current word, pos-1 is the tagging re-
sults of the previous word.

2.3 Empirical Results and Analysis 
We divide the training data provided by CLP2010 
into five folds, the first four of which are train cor-
pus, the last one is test corpus, on which we use 
the CRF++ toolkit for training and testing. Tag-
ging results with different features are shown in 
table 2. 
Table 2: tagging results with different features 
Model Explain Accuracy 
CRF baseline 93.52% 
CRF1 add w-1, pos-1 93.58% 
CRF2 add num 93.66% 
CRF3 add num, w-1, pos-1 93.68% 
CRF4 add num, rules 93.80% 
CRF5 add num, w-1, pos-1, rules 93.89% 
Tagging results show that the number of charac-
ter and POS information can be added to improve 
the accuracy of tagging, but in CLP2010, the tag-
ging accuracy is only 89.62%, on the one hand it 
may be caused by differences of corpus, on the 
other hand it may be due to that we don?t use all 
the features of CRFs but remove the features 
which appear one time in order to reduce the train-
ing time. 
3 Multi-level Chunking Based on ME 
3.1 Maximum Entropy Models and Maxi-
mum Entropy Markov Models 
Maximum entropy model is mainly used to esti-
mate the unknown probability distribution whose 
entropy is the maximum under some existing con-
ditions. Suppose h is the observations of context, t 
is tag, the conditional probability p (t | h) can be 
expressed as: 
exp( ( , ))( | ) ( )
ii i t hP t h Z h
f?? ?
 
where fi is the feature of model,  
( ) exp( ( , ))i it iZ h t hf??? ? 
 is a factor for nor-
malizing. 
i? is weigh of feature fi, training is the 
process of seeking the value of 
i? .  
Maximum entropy Markov model is the seria-
lized form of Maximum entropy model (McCal-
lum and Freitag and Pereira, 2000), for example, 
transition probabilities and emission probabilities 
are merged into a single conditional probability 
 function 
1( | , )i iP t t h?  in binary Maximum entropy 
Markov model, 
1( | , )i iP t t h?  is turned to ( | )p t h  to 
be solved by adding features which can express 
previously tagging information (Li and Sun and 
Guan, 2009). 
3.2 Base Chunking 
Following the method of multi-level chunking, we 
first do the base chunking on the sentences which 
are through the POS tagging, then loop the process 
of complex chunking until they can?t be merged. 
We use the existing Chinese base chunking system 
to do base chunking in laboratory, which marks 
boundaries and composition information of chunk 
with MEMM, and achieved 93.196% F-measure in 
Task 2: Chinese Base Chunking of CIPS-ParsEval 
-2009. The input and output of base chunking are 
as follows: 
Input???/nS ??/a  ??/n ?/v ??/nR  ?
?/n ?/p ??/n ?/uJDE ??/n ?/wD ??/n 
??/vN ?/f ?/wP ??/d  ??/v ?/wP ??/d  
??/v ?/c ??/d  ??/v ?/uJDE ??/v ??
/a  ??/n ??/n ?/uJDE ??/n  ??/n ?/wE 
Output???/nS [np ??/a  ??/n ] ?/v [np ?
?/nR  ??/n ] ?/p ??/n ?/uJDE [np ??
/n  ?/wD ??/n ] ??/vN ?/f ?/wP [vp ??
/d  ??/v ] ?/wP [vp ??/d  ??/v ] ?/c [vp 
??/d  ??/v ] ?/uJDE ??/v [np ??/a  ??
/n ] ??/n ?/uJDE [np ??/n  ??/n ] ?/wE 
3.3 Complex Chunking 
We take the sentences which are through POS tag-
ging and base chunking as input, using Li?s tag-
ging method and feature template. Categories of 
complex chunk include xx_Start, xx_Middle, 
xx_End and Other, where xx is a category of arbi-
trary chunk. The process of complex chunking is 
shown as follows: 
Step 1: input the sentences which are through POS 
tagging and base chunking, for example: 
??/nS  [np ??/a  ??/n  ] ?/uJDE  [np ??
/vN  ??/vN  ] ?/c  [np ??/n  ??/n  ]  
Step 2: if there are some category tags in the sen-
tence, then turn a series of tags to brackets, for 
instance, if continuous cells are marked as 
xx_Start, xx_Middle, ..., xx_Middle, xx_End, then 
the combination of continuous cells is a complex 
chunk xx; 
Step 3: determine the head words with the set of 
rules, and compress the sentence: 
??/nS  [np ??/n  ] ?/uJDE  [np ??/vN  ] ?
/c  [np ??/n  ] 
Step 4: if the sentence can be merged, mark the 
sentence with ME, then return step 2, else the 
analysis process ends: 
?? /nS@np_Start  [np ?? /n  ]@np_End ?
/uJDE@Other  [np ?? /vN  ]@np_Start ?
/c@np_Middle  [np ??/n  ]@np_End 
At last, the output is: 
[np [np ??/nS  [np ??/a  ??/n  ] ] ?/uJDE  
[np [np ??/vN  ??/vN  ] ?/c  [np ??/n  ?
?/n  ] ] ] 
Following the above method, we first use the 
Viterbi decoding, but in the decoding process we 
encountered two problems:  
1. Similar to the label xx_Start, whose back is only 
xx_Middle or xx_End, so the probability of 
xx_Start label turning to Other is 0, But, if only 
using ME to predict, the probability may not be 0.  
2. Viterbi decoding can?t solve that all the labels of 
predicted results are Other, if all labels are Other, 
they can?t be merged, this result doesn?t make 
sense. 
Solution:  
For the first question, we add the initial transfer 
matrix and the end transfer matrix in decoding 
process, that is, the corresponding xx_Middle or 
xx_End of xx_Start is seted to 1 in the transfer 
matrix, the others are marked as 0, matrix multip-
lication is taken during the state transition. It can 
effectively avoid errors caused by probability to 
improve accuracy.  
To rule out the second question, we use heuris-
tic search approach to decode, and exclude all 
Other labels with the above matrix. In addition, we 
defined another ME classifier to do some pruning 
in the decoding process, the features of ME clas-
sifier are POS, the head word, the POS of head 
word. The pseudo-code of Heuristic search is: 
While searching priority queue is not empty 
Take the node with the greatest priority in the 
queue; 
If the node?s depth = length of the chunking 
results 
Searching is over, reverse the search-
ing path to get searching results; 
Else 
Compute the probability of all candi-
date children nodes according to 
the current probability; 
Record searching path; 
Press it into the priority queue; 
In addition, we found that some punctuation at 
the end of a sentence can?t be merged, probably 
due to sparseness of data, according to that the 
tone punctuation (period, exclamation mark, ques-
 tion mark) at the end of the sentence can be added 
to implement a complete sentence (zj) (Zhou, 
2004), we carried out a separate deal with this sit-
uation, directly add punctuation at the end of the 
sentence, to form a sentence. 
In training data provided by CLP2010 in sub-
task: Complete Sentence Parsing, the head words 
aren?t marked. We can?t use the statistical method 
to determine the head words, but only by rules. We 
take Li?s rule set as baseline, but the rule set was 
used to supplement the statistical methods, so 
some head words don?t appear in the rule set, re-
sulting in many head words are marked as NULL, 
for this situation, we add some rules through expe-
riment, Table 3 lists some additional rules.

3.4 Empirical Results and Analysis 
We take the corpus which are through correct POS 
tagging and base chunking for training and testing, 
it is divided into five folds, the first four as train-
ing corpus, the last one as testing corpus, using the 
existing ME toolkit to train and test model in la-
boratory. Table 4 shows the results on Viterbi de-
coding and Heuristic Search method, where head 
words are determined by rules.

The system participated in the Complete Sen-
tence Parsing of CLP2010, results are shown in 
Table 5 below. Because we can?t determine the 
head words by statistical method on the corpus 
provided by CLP2010, resulting in the accuracy 
decreasing, creating a great impact on results.

4 Conclusions 
In this paper, we use CRFs to have a POS tagging, 
and increase the tagging accuracy by adjusting the 
feature template; multi-level chunking is applied 
to complete syntactic analysis, we do the base 
chunking with MEMM to recognize boundaries 
and components, and make the complex chunking 
with ME to generate a full parsing tree; on decod-
ing, we add transfer matrix to improve perfor-
mance, and remove some features with a ME clas-
sifier to reduce training time.  
As the training data are temporarily changed, 
our system?s training on the Event Description 
Sub-sentence Analysis of CLP2010 isn?t com-
pleted, and head words are marked in the training 
corpus of this task, so our next step will be to 
complete training and testing of this task, compare 
the existing evaluation results, and use ME clas-
sifier to determine head words, analyze impact of 
head words on system. On the POS tagging, we 
will retain all features to train and compare tag-
ging results.
