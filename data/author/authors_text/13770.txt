Abstract 
In this paper, we propose a novel 
similarity measure based on  
co-occurrence probabilities for inducing 
semantic classes. Clustering with the new 
similarity measure outperformed that 
with the widely used distance measure 
based on Kullback-Leibler divergence in 
precision, recall and F1 evaluation. We 
then use the induced semantic classes and 
structures by the new similarity measure 
to generate in-domain data. At last, we 
use the generated data to do language 
model adaptation and improve the result 
of character recognition from 85.2% to 
91%. 
1 Introduction 
Voice search (e.g. Wang et al, 2008) has 
recently become one of the major foci in spoken 
dialogue system research and development. In 
main stream large vocabulary ASR engines, 
statistical language models (n-grams in 
particular), usually trained with plenty of data, 
are widely used and proved very effective. But 
for a voice search system, we have to deal with 
the case where there is no or very little relevant 
data for language modeling. One of the 
conventional solutions to this problem is to 
collect and use some human-human or 
Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) dialogue data. Once the 
initial system is up running, the performance can 
be further improved with human-computer data 
in a system-in-the-loop style. Another practical 
approach is to handcraft some grammar rules and 
generate some artificial data. But writing 
grammars manually is tedious and 
time-consuming and requires some linguistic 
expertise. 
In this paper, we introduced a new similarity 
measure to induce semantic classes and 
structures. We then generated a large number of 
data using the induced semantic classes and 
structures to make language model adaptation. 
At the end, we give the conclusion and implied 
the future work. 
2 Semantic Class Induction 
The studies on semantic class induction in spoken 
language (or spoken language acquisition in 
general) have received some attention since the 
middle 90's. One of the earlier works is carried 
out by Gorin (1995), who employed an 
information -theoretic connectionist network 
embedded in a feedback control system to acquire 
spoken language. Later on Arai et al (1999) 
further studied how to acquire grammar 
fragments in fluent speech through clustering 
similar phrases using Kullback-Leibler distance. 
Meng and Siu (2002) proposed to 
semi-automatically induce language structures 
from unannotated corpora for spoken language 
understanding, mainly using Kullback-Liebler 
divergence and mutual information. Pargellis et 
al. (2004) used similar measures (plus three 
others) to induce semantic classes for comparing 
domain concept independence and porting 
concepts across domains. Potamianos (2005, 
2006, 2007) and colleagues conducted a series of 
studies to further improve semantic class 
induction, including combining wide and narrow 
context similarity measures, and adopting a 
soft-clustering algorithm (via a probabilistic 
class-membership function). 
2.1 Clustering 
In general, words and phrases which appear in 
similar context usually share similar semantics. 
E.g., ????(Tsinghua University) and ??
??(Peking University) in the following two 
utterances (literal translations are given in 
brackets) are both names of place or 
organisation. 
 
? ? ???? ?? ? ??? 
Please/look for/Tsinghua University/near//bank 
(Please look for banks near Tsinghua 
University.) 
 
? ? ???? ?? ? ???? 
Please/look for/Peking University/nearby//gym 
(Please look for gyms near Peking University.) 
 
To automatically discover that the above two 
words have similar semantics from unannotated 
corpus, we try unsupervised clustering based on 
some similarity measures to induce semantic 
classes. Further details about similarity measures 
are given in section 2.2.  
Before clustering, the utterances are 
segmented into phrases using a simple maximum 
matching against a lexicon. Clustering are 
conducted on phrases, which may be of a single 
word. 
2.2 Similarity Measures 
For lexical distributional similarity, several 
measures have been proposed and adopted, e.g., 
Meng and Siu (2002), Lin(1998), Dagan et al 
(1999), Weeds et al (2004). 
We use two kinds of similarity measures in 
the experiments. One is similarity measure based 
on distance, and the other is a new similarity 
measure directly using the co-occurrence 
probabilities. 
2.3 Distance based similarity measures 
The relative entropy between two probability 
mass functions )(xp  and )(xq  is defined by 
(Cover and Thomas, 2006) as: 
)(
)(
log
)(
)(
log)()||(
xq
xp
E
xq
xp
xpqpD p
Xx
== ?
?
(1) 
The relative entropy, as an asymmetric 
distance between two distributions, measures the 
inefficiency of assuming that the distribution is 
q  when the true distribution is p . 
It is commonly used as a statistical distance 
and can be symmetry as follows: 
)||()||(),( pqDqpDqpdiv +=      (2) 
For two words in a similar context, e.g., in 
the sequence { ,...,,..., 11 www ? }, 
where w  can be word a  or b , the right 
bigram )||(1
RR baD and )||(1
RR abD  are 
defined as: 
 
??= W b)|p(w
a)|p(w
a)|p(wbaD

??= W a)|p(w
b)|p(w
b)|p(wabD

1 1

11 log)||( (4) 
where W  is the set of words or phrases. 
And the symmetric divergence is 
)||()||(),( 111
RRRRRR abDbaDbadiv += (5) 
The left bigram symmetric divergence can be 
similarly defined. 
Using both left and right symmetric 
divergences, the distance between a  and b  
is 
),(),(),( 111
RRLL badivbadivbad +=     (6) 
So the KL distance becomes:

This is the widely used distance measure for  
lexical semantic similarity, e.g., Dagan et al 
(1999); Meng and Siu (2002); Pargellis et al
(2004). We can also see the IR distance and L1

In Pargellis et al (2004), the lexical context 
is further extended from bigrams to trigrams as 
follows. For the sequence: 
,...,,,,..., 2112 wwwww ??  
where w  can be word a  or b , the trigram 
KL between  a  and b is:

Since more information is taken into account 
in b)(a,KL2 , more constraints are imposed on the 
similarity measure. This is expected to improve 
the precision of clustering but may lead to a lower 
recall. 
2.4 Co-occurrence Probability based 
similarity measures 
After a close investigation of the corpus, we 
came up with an intuitive similarity measure 
directly based on the co-occurrence probability. 
The key idea is that the more common 
neighbouring words or phrases any two words or 
phrases in question share, the more similar they 
are to each other. Therefore, for each left or right 
neighboring word or phrase, we take the lower 
conditional probability into account. 
Thus we have the following similarity 
measures:

After pairs of words or phrases are clustered 
above, those pairs with common members are 
further merged. 
2.5 Comparison of measures 
The KL distances emphasize on the difference of 
two probability but the new measure take the 
probability itself into account. Take the right 
bigram context the similarity measure for 
example:

We can also get the y)(x,IRR  and |1 y)(x,L R

We can see from the four figures (the space 
distribution of four bigram metrics) that four 
curve surface are all symmetric. The curve 
surface of the three distance (KL,IR, L1) all 
contain the curve of (19), and curve surface of 
the minimum similarity contains the curve of 
(20). We say that the KL distances, IR distances 
and L1 distances all emphasize only on the 
distances and don't take the probability itself into 
account.  
We take the right context of two pairs 
),( 11 ba  and ),( 22 ba  for example. If

3 Experiments and Results 
3.1 Data 
In our experiments, four types of corpora are 
exploited in different stages and different ways.  
z T: A large collection of text corpus is used 
to train a general n-gram language model.  
z H: Some WOZ dialogues were collected 
before the system is built, using a similar 
scenario where users talked in Chinese to a 
service provider (human) via telephone to 
search for local information, or information 
about some local points of interest (POI). 
These dialogues were manually transcribed 
and used for language model training. This 
is the best data we could get before the 
system is built though it is not the real but 
near in-domain data.  
z C: After the initial system was up running, 
some real human-computer dialogues were 
collected and transcribed. These dialogues 
were split into three sets. One (C1) is used 
for semantic class and structure induction. 
One (C2) is used as test data. The other (C3) 
is reserved.  
z A: Domain information (domain entities) is 
used in conjunction with the induced 
semantic classes and structures from C1 to 
generate a large amount of in-domain 
corpus for language model adaptation. In 
Table 1,  we give some statistics in terms 
of the number of utterances(no. u) and 
Chinese characters(no. c) for the above 
corpora.

Table 1. statistics of different corpus 
3.2 Semantic Clustering 
We conducted clustering with the above 
similarity measures on the data set C1. 
During the clustering, it is required that all the 
probabilities involved in calculating similarity be 
larger than 0. We have no threshold except this 
constraint. 
The outcomes are pairs of phrases. 
It is noticed that most of the clustered words 
and phrases are domain entities. 
In our experiments, we merged the induced 
similar pairs into large clusters. For example, if 
a  is similar to b  and b  is similar to c , then 
( a , b , c ) are merged into one category. In the 
end we use the categories to replace those words 
and phrases in corpus C1 and obtained templates. 
Examples of  the results are given below. 
 
$ask $toponym $near $wh-word $sevice 
[??] $ask $toponym $near ? $sevice ? 
? ? $toponym $ask ??? $poi 
where: 
$ask = ?? | ???| ???? | ... 
$toponym = ???? | ??? | ... 
$sevice = ?? | ??? | ??? |... 
$near = ?? | ?? | ... 
$wh-word = ??? | ??? | ??? | ... 
$poi = ???? | ????? | ... 
 
To evaluate the induction performance, we 
compare the induced word pairs against manual 
annotation. We manually annotated each phrase 
with a tag like $toponym, $poi and so on. If a  
and b  are calculated as a pairs and the 
annotation is the same, we see that they are 
correctly induced which is referred to Pangos 
(2006).  
We compute the metrics of precision P , 
recall R  and f-score 1F  as follows: 
%100?=
M
m
P                        (21) 
where m  is the number of correctly induced 
pairs, and M  is the number of induced pairs. 
%100?=
N
n
R                        (22) 
where n  is the number of correctly induced 
words and phrases, and N  is the number of 
words and phrases in the annotation.

which is a harmonic mean of P  and R . 
 
Figure 2. Induction process 
The iterate process we adopted is as in 
Pargellis et al (2004). In the first iteration, we 
calculated the similarity and use the largest 
similarity pairs to generate large classes which 
can be called semantic generalizer. Then we use 
these semantic classes to replace the corpus, and 
obtained new corpus just as the example 
presented above. Then we duplicate this process 
for the second iteration and so on.

by KL and S1 similarity measure 
 
Figure 5. F1 according to iterations induced by 
KL and S1 similarity measure 
 
Figure 6. F1 according to iterations induced by 
all bigram similarity measure 
From figures (Figure 3-6), we can see that 
clustering with our new co-occurrence 
probability based similarity measures 
outperforms that with the widely used relative 
entropy based distance measure consistently for 
both bigram and trigram contexts. This confirms 
the effectiveness of our new and simple measure. 
Regarding the context size, the results from 
using the bigram context outperforms that from 
using the trigram context in precision. But recall 
and 1F  drops a lot.  This is due to that larger 
contexts bring more constraints. The context size 
effect holds for both types of similarity measures. 
And the best performance is achieved with the 
similarity measure 3S . It is based on 1S  and 
takes both left and right contexts into account at 
the same time. 
3.3 Corpus Generation 
Since the number of the domain entities 
(terminals) we can collect from the dialogues is 
very limited, we have to expand those variables 
(non-terminals) in the induced templates with 
domain information from the application 
database and relevant web sites. For example, we 
used all the words and phrases in the toponym  
cluster, e.g., ``????  | ???  | ...'', to 
replace $toponym in the templates above. Then 
we generated a large collection of artificial data 
which has a good coverage in both the utterance 
structures (the way people speak) and the domain 
entities. This resulted in the generated corpus A 
in Table 1. In generation we used the semantic 
classes and structures  induced with 3S  and 
manually corrected some obvious errors. In the 
generated data, there are 14,205 utterances and 
365,576 Chinese characters.: 
3.4 Language Model Adaptation 
There are some language model adaptation 
(LMA) work oriented to the dialogue systems e.g. 
Wang et al2006), Hakkani-T?r et al(2006),  
Bellegarda(2004). So far major effort has been 
spent on adaptation for large vocabulary speech 
recognition or transcription tasks. But recently 
there have been a few studies that are oriented 
toward dialogue systems, e.g. Wang et al2006), 
Hakkani-T?r et al(2006). In our experiments, 
three trigram language models were built, each 
trained separately on the large text collection (T), 
on the WOZ data (H) and on the artificially 
generated data (A). These trigram models were 
then combined through model interpolation as 
follows: We used the linear interpolation to adapt 
language model. The formula is shown as follows. 
T is the out-of-domain data, H is the 
humane-to-humane dialogues, and A is the 
corpus generated by grammars

where 1,,0 << AHT ???  and 1=++ AHT ??? . 
The weights were determined empirically on 
the held-out data (C3 in Table 1}). 
All the language models were built with the 
Stolcke(2002)?s {SRILM} toolkit. 
Why we did not use the C corpus directly is that it 
does't have a good covering on the 
domain-entities and other users usually say 
utterances similar to C in structures but different 
domain entities. So we use the good covering 
generated data to make LMA.  
We evaluated the different language models 
with both intrinsic and extrinsic metrics. For 
intrinsic evaluation, we computed the perplexity. 
For extrinsic evaluation, we ran speech 
recognition experiments on the test data C2 and 
calculated the character error rate (CER).  
We can see that corpus A is useful to make 
model adaptation and it is closer to the in-domain 
data than the human-human data for 
human-computer dialogues. By using these 
generated sentences, our domain-specific 
Chinese speech recognition have a growth from 
85.2% to 91.4%.

Table 2. perplexity and character error rate 
according to model interpolation 
The optimized weights (0.2,0.4,0.4) is 
obtained from the develop sets C3. From Table 2, 
we can see that language models built using 
additional dialogue related data, either 
human-human/WOZ  dialogues or data 
generated from human-computer dialogues, 
shows significant improvement in both 
perplexity and speech recognition performance 
over the one built with the general text data only. 
For the two dialogue related data, the generated 
data is better than the WOZ data or closer to the 
test data, since perplexity further drops from 
103.5 to 38.1 and CER drops from 14.8 to 10.7. 
This confirms our conjecture that human-human 
WOZ dialogue data is near in-domain and not 
very proper for human-computer dialogues. 
Therefore, to effectively improve language 
modeling for human-computer dialogues, we 
need more in-domain data, even if it is generated 
or artificial. The best language model is obtained 
through interpolation of both language models 
from dialogue related data with the one from 
general text data. This may be because there is 
still some mismatch between data sets C1 (for 
induction and generation) and C2 (for test).  
And some of the missing bits in C1 appeared in 
the WOZ data (corpus A). 
4 Related Works 
The most relevant work to ours is done by Wang 
et al (2006), who generated in-domain data 
through out-of-domain data transformation. First 
some artificial sentences are generated through 
parsing and reconstructing out-of-domain data 
and the illegal ones are filtered out. Then the 
synthetic corpus is sampled to achieve a desired 
probability distribution, based on either 
simulated dialogues or semantic information 
extracted from development data. But we used a 
different approach in producing more in-domain 
data. First semantic classes and structures are 
induced from limited human-computer dialogues. 
Then large amount of artificial in-domain corpus 
is generated with the induced semantic classes 
and patterns augmented with domain entities. 
The main difference between the two works lies 
in how the data is generated and how the 
generated data helped. 
5 Conclusions and Future Work 
In this paper, we described our work on 
generating in-domain corpus using the 
auto-induced semantic classes and structures for 
language model adaptation in a Chinese voice 
search dialogue system. In inducing semantic 
classes we proposed a novel co-occurrence 
probability based similarity measure. Our 
experiments show that the simple co-occurrence 
probability based similarity measure is effective 
for semantic clustering which is used in our 
experiment. For interpolation based language 
model adaptation, the data generated using the 
induced semantic classes and structures 
enhanced with domain entities helped a lot for 
human-computer dialogues. Despite that we 
dealt with the language of Chinese, we believe 
that that approaches we employed are language 
independent and can be applied to other 
languages as well. 
In our experiment we noticed that the 
performance of semantic clustering was affected 
quite a lot by the noises in the data. For future 
work, we would like to investigate how to 
further improve the robustness of semantic 
clustering in noisy spoken language. The 
semantic structures induced above are very 
shallow. We would like to investigate how to 
find deep semantics and relations in the data.
