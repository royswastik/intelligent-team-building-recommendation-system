Abstract 
Chinese parsing has received more and 
more attention, and in this paper, we use 
toolkit to perform parsing on the data of 
Tsinghua Chinese Treebank (TCT) used in 
CIPS, and we use Conditional Random 
Fields (CRFs) to train specific model for the 
head recognition. At last, we compare 
different results on different POS results. 
1 Introduction 
    In the past decade, Chinese parsing has 
received more and more attention, it is the 
core of Chinese information processing 
technology, and it is also the cornerstone for 
deep understanding of Chinese.  
    Parsing is to identify automatically 
syntactic units in the sentence and give the 
relationship between these units. It is based 
on a given grammar. The results of parsing 
are usually structured syntax tree. For 
example, the parsing result of sentence "?
???????" is as following. 
                           (ROOT 
(dj (nS ??) 
(vp (v ?) 
(np 
                              (np (m ?) (n ??)) 
                           (n ??))))) 
With the development of Chinese 
economy, Chinese information processing 
has become a worldwide hot spot, and 
parsing is an essential task. However, 
parsing is a recognized research problem, 
and it is so difficult to meet the urgent needs 
of industrial applications in accuracy, 
robustness, speed. So the study of Chinese 
grammar and syntax analysis algorithm are 
still the focus of Chinese information 
processing.  
In all the parsing technology research, 
English parsing research is the most in-depth, 
and there are three main aspects of research 
in statistical parsing, they are  parsing model, 
parsing algorithm, and corpus construction. 
As for the parsing model, currently there are 
four commonly used parsing models, PCFG 
model [1], the model based on historical, 
Hierarchical model of progressive, head-
driven model [2]. 
 Since parsing is mostly a data driven 
process, its performance is determined by 
the amount of data in a Treebank on which a 
parser is trained. Much more data for 
English than for any other languages have 
been available so far. Thus most researches 
on parsing are concentrated on English. It is 
unrealistic to directly apply any existing 
parser trained on an English Treebank for 
Chinese sentences. But the methodology is, 
without doubt, highly applicable. Even for 
those corpora with special format and 
information integrated some modification 
and enhancement on a well-performed parser 
to fit the special structure for the data could 
help to obtain a good performance.  
    This paper presents our solution for the 
shared Task 2 of CIPS2010-Chinese Parsing. 
We exploit an existing powerful parser, 
Stanford parser, which has showed its 
effectiveness on English, with necessary 
modifications for parsing Chinese for the 
shared task. Since the corpus used in CIPS is 
from TCT, and the sentence contains the 
head-word information, but for the Stanford 
parser, it can't recognize the head 
constituents. So we apply a sequence tagging 
method to label head constituents based on 
the data extracted from the TCT corpus, In 
section 2 and section 3, we will present the  
Table 1. Training data with different formats 
 
details of our approach, and In section 4, we 
present the details of experiment. 
 
2 Parsing 
    Since English parsing has made many 
achievements, so we investigated some 
statistical parsing models designed for 
English. There are three open source 
constituent parsers, Stanford parser [3], 
Berkeley parser [4] and Bikel's parser [5]. 
Bikel's parser is an implementation of 
Collins' head-driven statistical model [6]. 
The Stanford parser is based on the factored 
model described in [7]. Berkeley parser is 
based on unlexicalized parsing model, as 
described in [8]. 
All the three parsers are claimed to be 
multilingual parsers but only accept training 
data in UPenn Treebank format. To adapt 
these parsers to Tsinghua Chinese Treebank 
(TCT) used in CIP, we firstly transform the 
TCT training data into UPenn format. Then, 
some slight modifications have been made to 
the three parsers. So that they could fulfill 
the needs in our task. 
In our work, we use Stanford parser to 
train our model by change the training data 
to three parts with different formats, one for 
training parsing model, one for training POS 
model, and the last for training head-
recognition model. Table 1 shows the three 
different forms. 
 
3 Head recognition 
    Head recognition is to find the head 
word in a clause, for example, 'np-1' express 
that in the clause, the word with index '1' is 
the key word. 
    To recognize the head constituents, and 
extra step is needed since Stanford parsing 
could not provide a straight forward way for 
this. Consider that head constituents are 
always determined by their syntactic symbol 
and their neighbors, whose order and 
relations strongly affects the head labeling. 
Like chunking [9], it is natural to apply a 
sequence labeling strategy to tackle this 
problem. We adopt the linear-chain CRF 
[10], one of the most successful sequence 
labeling framework so far, for the head 
recognition is this stage.  
    
4 Experiment 
4.1 Data 
    The training data is from Tsinghua 
Chinese Treebank (TCT), and our task is to 
perform full parsing on them. There are 
37218 lines in official released training data, 
As the Table 1 show; we change the data 
into three parts for different models. 
The testing data doesn?t contain POS 
labels, and there are 1000 lines in official 
released testing data.

4.2 Models training 
4.2.1 Parsing model training 
    As for training parsing model with 
Stanford parser, since there are little 
parameters need to set, so we directly use the 
Stanford parser to train a model without any 
parameter setting. 
4.2.2 POS model training 
    In this session of the evaluation, POS 
tagging is no longer as a separate task, so we 
have to train our own POS tagging model. In 
the evaluation process, we didn't fully 
consider the POS tagging results' impact on 
the overall results, so we didn't train the POS 
model specially, we directly use the POS 
function in Stanford parser toolkit. This has 
led to relatively poor results in POS tagging, 
and it also affects the overall parsing result. 
After the evaluation, we train a specific 
model to improve the POS tagging results. 
As the table 1 shows, we extract training 
data from the original corpus and adopt the 
linear-chain CRF to train a POS tagging 
model. Table 2 shows the original POS 
tagging results and new results.  
4.2.3 Head recognition model training 
As the table 1 shows, we extract specific 
training data from original corpus.  
Table 3.  Training data formats for Head-
recognition

??/n  ??/n  ] ]

And for head-word recognition, since the 
adjacent clause has little effect on the 
recognition of head-word, so we set the 
clause as the smallest unit. We chose CRF to 
train our model. However, for getting the 
proper format of data for training in CRF, 
We have to do further processing on the data. 
As the table 3 shows, the final data set word 
as the unit. 
For example, the line 'n O np vp 1?, the 
meaning from beginning to end is POS or 
clause mark of current word or clause, POS 
or clause mark of previous word, POS or 
clause mark of latter word, the clause mark 
of current word, and the last mean that if 
current word or clause is headword 1 
represents YES, 0 represents NO. 
4.4 Result and Conclusion 
As we mention before, in evaluation, we 
didn't train specific POS tagging model, So 
we re-train our pos model, and the new 
results is shown in table 6, it can be seen that, 
with the increase of POS result, there is a 
corresponding increase in the overall results.

Through our evaluation results, we can 
see that it is not appropriate to directly use 
English parser toolkit to process Chinese. 
And it is urgent to development parsing 
model based on the characteristics of 
Chinese.
