Abstract 
Tibetan word segmentation is essential 
for Tibetan information processing. Peo-
ple mainly use the basic machine match-
ing method which is based on dictionary 
to segment Tibetan words at present, 
because there is no segmented Tibetan 
corpus which can be used for training in 
Tibetan word segmentation. But the 
method based on dictionary is not fit to 
Tibetan number identification. This pa-
per studies the characteristics of Tibetan 
numbers, and then, proposes a method 
to identify Tibetan numbers based on 
classification of number components. 
The method first tags every number 
component according to the class it be-
longs to while segmenting, and then up-
dates the tag series according to some 
predefined rules. At last adjacent num-
ber components are combined to form a 
Tibetan number if they meet a certain 
requirement. In the testing result from 
7938K Tibetan corpus, the identification 
accuracy is 99.21%. 
1 Introduction 
As a phonetic writing script, Tibetan syllables 
are separated with syllable dots. But like Chi-
nese, there is no separator between Tibetan 
words. Tibetan word segmentation is essential 
for Tibetan information processing. In recent 
years, many experts did much work on Tibetan 
word segmentation. CHEN Yuzhong (2003) 
proposed a method based on case auxiliary 
words and continuous features to segment Ti-
betan text. Based on this method, using reinstal-
lation rules to identify Abbreviated Words, CAI 
Zhijie (2009) designed and implemented the 
Banzhida Tibetan word segmentation system. 
QI (2006) proposed a three level method to 
segment Tibetan text. Dolha (2007), Zhaxijia 
(2007), CAI Rangjia (2009) and TASHI (2009) 
researched the word categories and annotation 
scheme for Tibetan corpus and the parts-of-
speech and tagging set standards. At present, 
there is no corpus for Tibetan word segmenta-
tion. However, models which are used in Chi-
nese word segmentation, such as HMM, ME, 
CRF, have to be trained with segmented corpus. 
As a result, we can?t use them in Tibetan word 
segmentation. So people mainly use machine 
matching method based on dictionary in Tibetan 
word segmentation. But machine matching can 
not be used to identify Tibetan numbers because 
we can not include all numbers in the dictionary. 
In Tibetan text, numbers have 3 different rep-
resentations. The first is Arabic numbers, such 
as ?2010?. The second is Tibetan alphabet num-
bers composed with Tibetan digital characters: 
?(0),?(1),?(2),?(3),?(4),?(5), ?(6), ?(7), 
719
?(8),?(9), such as ??????(2010). The third is 
Tibetan syllable numbers(?Tibetan numbers? in 
short) which are composed with Tibetan sylla-
bles, such as ???????(fifteen).The former two 
classes of numbers can be identified by combin-
ing adjacent number characters. However, this 
method is not fit to the third class, because some 
Tibetan syllables are used not only in numbers 
but also in other common words. 
According to papers written by Dolha (2007), 
Zhaxijia (2007), CAI Rangjia (2009) and 
TASHI (2009), Tibetan numbers should be 
taken as single words in Tibetan word segmen-
tation, however, we haven?t found any paper on 
the issue of the identification of Tibetan num-
bers in Tibetan word segmentation. 
In this paper, we propose a method which is 
based on classification of number components 
to identify the third class of numbers. 
2 Composition of Tibetan numbers 
In Tibetan, we use the following syllables 
(words) to express the meanings of number one 
to nine: ???? ????? ????? ???? ??? ???? ????? ?????? ????, 
and the following different syllables for ten, 
hundred, thousand, ten thousand, million, ten 
million and so on: ???? ????? ?????? ???? ????? ???? ?????? 
??????????..Generally, Tibetan syllable numbers 
are composed by these syllables, but some 
syllables have variants, and sometimes we have 
to use different conjunctions according to the 
context. The composition of Tibetan syllable 
numbers has the following rules. 
1. Number 1-10 are expressed with the syl-
lables mentioned above, but sometimes 
variants are used: ???(1),????(2),????(3). 
2. Number ?tens? (20, 30, 40 ?) have the 
form of ?(2-9)+????. but in ?20?, ?30?, 
variants of ?2? and ?3? are used, while in 
?60?, ?70?, ?80?, variant of ?ten?(???) is 
used. 
3. Number 11-19 have the form of 
????(10)+(1-9)?, but in ?13? and ?15? 
variant of ?10?(????) is used. 
4. Number 21-99, except ?tens?, have the 
form of ?(tens)+conjunction+(1-9)?. Dif-
ferent conjunctions are used according to 
different ?tens?: ??? ???  ??? ??? ??? ???? ??? ??. 
Sometimes, this form is abbreviated to 
?conjunction+(1-9)?. 
5. In number which is larger then 100, con-
junction (??) may be used, just like 
?and? in the reading of English number 
?115?. Sometimes, (???) is used to ex-
press the meaning of vacancy. For ex-
ample, number ?507? is ??????????????????????: 
???(five) ?????(hundred)???? (ten)????(has 
no)???? (seven).  
6. Composition of numbers larger than 
1000 can be deduced. 
7. Ordinal numeral has the form of ?(cardi-
nal numeral)+(?or??)?. 
8. Multiples have the form of ????+ (cardi-
nal numeral)?. 
9. Fractions have the form of ?(cardinal 
numeral) +?+ (cardinal numeral)?. 
10. Decimals have the form of ?(cardinal 
numeral) +??+(????????or???)+ (cardinal 
numeral)?. ?????????? or ????? means the 
decimal point. 
11. Approximate numbers have the form of 
?(cardinal numeral)+(suffix)?. Suffix can 
be one of (??? ??? ?????? ??????? ?????????? 
??????????) according to the meaning to 
be expressed. 
12. Some Tibetan numbers don?t obey the 
above rules. They have no form of num-
ber, but have meanings of number, such 
as ??????? (first). 
3 Tibetan number identification 
In this paper, we call all syllables mentioned in 
the previous section ?number components? in 
general. For some of these number components, 
we can take it as a part of number when we 
meet one of them. For others, we can?t, because 
they can be used to express non-number mean-
ings. So we have to check whether it is a part of 
a number according to the context when we 
meet a number component. 
Tibetan number identification is a part of Ti-
betan word segmentation. In Tibetan word seg-
720
mentation system, Tibetan text is segmented 
into words by maximum matching method. In 
this procedure, every Tibetan number is seg-
mented into number components. Then, identi-
fication module combines adjacent number 
components when they meet a certain prede-
fined rules. 
In this section, we first briefly introduce the 
whole procedure of Tibetan word segmentation, 
then the classification of number components 
and the tagging method to identify Tibetan 
number.

Figure 1. The flow chart of Tibetan word seg-
mentation 
 
As shown in Figure 1, for the input Tibetan text, 
we first segment it into sentences. Then we seg-
ment each sentence into parts with case-
auxiliary words. In this procedure, a critical dic-
tionary is used because case-auxiliary words can 
be a part of some Tibetan words (critical words). 
When we meet a critical word in Tibetan text, 
we should not segment it into shorter words. 
Next, we segment each part into words and 
identify the abbreviated word (CAI Zhijie, 2009) 
by maximum matching method with a common 
dictionary and the number components diction-
ary. At last, we identify Tibetan numbers and 
output word segmentation result. 
In the procedure of segmenting a part into 
words, a Tibetan number is segmented into 
words; we must ensure every one of them is a 
number component. To do this, both common 
dictionary and number components dictionary 
are used. As we use maximum matching method, 
all Tibetan number words in the common dic-
tionary should be obsolete. 
Identification module tags each number com-
ponent with a tag according to the class which it 
belongs to, then updates the tags and combines 
adjacent number components when they meet a 
certain predefined rules. 
3.2 Classification of number components 
We classify number components into the fol-
lowing five classes according to their functions 
and ambiguity. 
Basic number: these number components are 
the basis of Tibetan numbers. Every one of 
them can be an independent number. If we meet 
it in context, we should take it as a part of a Ti-
betan number. Including: Tibetan number 1-
9(???? ????? ????? ???? ??? ???? ????? ?????? ????); ten, 
hundred, thousand, ten thousand, million, ten 
million and so on(???? ????? ?????? ???? ????? ???? ?????? 
??????????); and their variants. 
Number prefix: when it is used as a part of 
Tibetan number, the next word must be a basic 
number, while the previous word may be or 
may not be a number component. Including: 
abbreviations of ?(tens)+conjunction? (???  ??? ??? 
??? ???? ??? ??); variants of 1, 2, 3(??? ???? ???); 
decimal point(?????????and???). 
Number linker: when it is used as a part of 
Tibetan number, both the previous word and the 
next word must be number components. These 
include (???? ? ????). Conjunctions (???  ??? ??? ??? 
???? ??? ??) belong to number prefix class, so we 
don?t include them in this class. But Conjunc-
tion (??) doesn?t belong to number prefix class, 
we include it in this class. 
721
Number suffix: these number components 
are used to express the meaning of ?total num-
ber?, ?approximate number?, and ?ordinal num-
ber? and so on. They follow basic number and 
should be taken as a part of Tibetan number 
word. Including: ??? ??? ?????? ??????? ?????????? 
?????????? 
Independent number: these number com-
ponents have no form of number, but have 
meanings of number, such as ??????? (first). 
The difference between ?basic number? and 
?Independent number? is: a basic number can 
be a Tibetan number itself or a part of a Tibetan 
number, while an independent number is a Ti-
betan number itself, but it can?t be a part of a 
Tibetan number. 
3.3 Number identification 
As shown in Figure 2, identification module 
tags each number component with a tag accord-
ing to the class which it belongs to, then updates 
the tags and combines adjacent number compo-
nents when they meet a certain predefined rules. 
 
 
Figure 2. The flow of number identification 
 
Class Tag 
Basic number N (Number) 
Number prefix P (Prefix) 
Number linker L (Linker) 
Number suffix S(Suffix) 
Independent number I(Independent)
Other(non-number) O (Other) 
Table 1. Classes and their tags 
 
We assign every class with a tag, as shown in 
Table 1. The tagging procedure screens every 
segmented part of Tibetan sentences, and tags 
every word with a tag according to the class 
which the word belongs to. If the word is not a 
number component, we tag it with ?O? (Other). 
As some number components can be used to 
express non-number meanings, (the cases exist 
in both number prefix class and number linker 
class), we have to check whether it is a part of a 
number according to the context. For number 
prefix, we take it as a part of number only if it is 
followed by a basic number, while for number 
linker, only if it follows a basic number and it is 
followed by another basic number. We define 
two rules to do this work. 
 
Rule 1: update tag series ?PN? to ?NN?. 
Rule 2: update tag series ?NLN? to ?NNN?. 
 
The tags updating algorithm applies the rules 
to the current word series until no tag is updated. 
After tags updating, the tag of a number prefix 
(?P?) is updated to ?N? when it is a part of Ti-
betan number in the context, but the tag will still 
be ?P? when it is not a part of Tibetan number. 
It is the same for number linkers. 
Combination algorithm combines adjacent 
number components to form a Tibetan number 
word. It mainly combines continuous number 
components with tags ?NN?N?, and the fol-
lowing word is combined too if it has a tag ?S?. 
The tag of the number is updated to ?N?. All 
words with tag ?N? or ?I? are taken as Tibetan 
numbers after combination. 
Then the segmentation result is output. 
For example, for the following Tibetan sen-
tence: 
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
???????????????????????????????????????????????? (A consider-
able parts of accidents were due to the faults of 
1% or even 0.5% of components.) 
After parts segmentation and maximum 
matching word segmentation, it is segmented to: 
????????/ ??????/ ????/ ???/ ?????/ ??/ ?????/ ???/ ????/ 
?????/ ??/ ?????????/ ??/ ???/ ????????/ ????/ ????????????/ ??/ 
??????????/ ???/ ?????/ ????/ 
After tagging: 
????????/(O) ??????/(O) ????/(O) ???/(O) ?????/(N) 
??/(L) ?????/(N) ???/(O) ????/(O) ?????/(N) ??/(L) 
?????????/(P) ??/(N) ???/(O) ????????/(O) ????/(O) 
????????????/(O) ??/(O) ??????????/(O) ???/(O) ?????/(O) 
????/(O) 
The corresponding tag series is: 
OOOONLNOONLPNOOOOOOOOO 
After the first run of tags updating, the tag se-
ries is changed to: 
OOOONNNOONLNNOOOOOOOOO 
722
After the second run of tags updating, the tag 
series is changed to: 
OOOONNNOONNNNOOOOOOOOO 
In the third run of tags updating, no tag is up-
dated. Then, combination algorithm combines 
adjacent number components corresponding to 
the continuous ?N? tags. The result is: 
????????/ ??????/ ????/ ???/ ????????????/ ???/ ????/ 
?????????????????/ ???/ ????????/ ????/ ????????????/ ??/ 
??????????/ ???/ ?????/ ????/ 
The corresponding tag series is: 
OOOONOONOOOOOOOOO 
It has two ?N? tags, which means two Ti-
betan numbers are identified.

Figure 3. Accuracy of Tibetan number identifi-
cation on 6 corpuses 
 
As there is no corpus for Tibetan word segmen-
tation, we have to make experiment on original 
Tibetan texts. We make use of several books 
which are written in Tibetan, and collect many 
web pages from several Tibetan web sites. After 
preprocessing, we get six corpuses. The basic 
information about the corpuses is shown in Ta-
ble 2. Note that, in Table 2, the column ?BNS? 
includes all sentences which have in it at least 
one number component belonging to basic 
number class, while the column ?TNS? includes 
all sentences which have at least one Tibetan 
number in it. The count of the former is signifi-
cantly larger than the count of the later because 
some basic numbers are used in idioms and 
proverbs which should be segmented as single 
words, thus we don?t take them as number com-
ponents under this circumstance. Figure 3 
shows the results of our experiment. As we can 
see, the total identification accuracy is 99.21%. 
As we have included all basic numbers in our 
method, theoretically the recall is 100%.  
After analyzing the results, we find that 
wrongly identified words can be divided into 
two classes. One is that there is a conjunction 
(??) between two Tibetan numbers, but is taken 
as one Tibetan number, such as ??????????????? (ten 
and twenty), ?????????????????????? (ten thousand and 
twenty thousand). The other is that some Ti-
betan numbers has other non-number meanings 
in the context, but our algorithm takes them as 
numbers. For instance, ????????? means 41 when 
it is used as a number, but it has another mean-
ing of ?similarly?; ???????? means 75 when it is 
used as a number, but it has the meaning of ?the 
five internal organs?. 
5 Conclusion 
Tibetan syllables are separated with syllable 
dots. But like Chinese, there is no separator be-
tween Tibetan words. Tibetan word segmenta-
tion is essential for Tibetan information process-
ing.  People mainly use machine matching in 
Tibetan word segmentation base on dictionary. 
But machine matching can not be used to iden-
tify Tibetan numbers because we can not in-
clude all numbers in our dictionary. This paper 
proposes a method to tag number components 
according to the classes they belong to, and then 
apply predefined rules to update tag series, and 
next combine adjacent number components to 
723
form a Tibetan number. In the testing result 
from 7938K Tibetan corpus, the identification 
accuracy is 99.21%, which means that this 
method is feasible to be applied to Tibetan word 
segmentation.

Abstract
In this paper, a large scale modern Tibetan text corpus is built, which includes about 190 thou-
sands documents, 67.21 million words, 93.66 million syllables in total. Based on the corpus,
statistics are made in several language units in different granularities. Statistical data show that
: a syllable has 3.26 letters or 2.20 super characters in average, while a sentence has 75.40 let-
ters or 63.14 super characters. The top 10 super characters, syllables, words take up 66.3156%,
16.5556%, 24.6415% of the corpus respectively. Curves for the n-gram frequency-rank list of
super chars, syllables and words are plotted. It shows that when all the n-gram phrases for
n = 1, 2, . . . , 5 are put together and sorted by frequency in descending order, the frequency-rank
curves in log-log axes can be fitted well by a straight line for the unit of syllable and word respec-
tively. But for the unit of super character, we didn?t find a curve that can be fitted well enough by
a straight line even if we combine all the n-grams for n = 1, 2, . . . , 10.
1 Introduction
The statistical property is the natural property of a language. In recent tens of years, people made sta-
tistical analysis on Tibetan characters or syllables. But it?s difficult to make statistics on larger language
units such as word and n-gram word phrases, especially on a large scale corpus. There are two reasons
resulting in the difficulty. First, as Tibetan is a resource poor language, it?s hard to build a large scale
Tibetan text corpus. Second, Tibetan word segmentation technology is not well developed even until
now.
In this paper, we report our word on the statistics on Tibetan based on the language units such as
character, syllable, word and their n-gram pairs on a large scale corpus. The remainder of the paper
is organized as follow. Tibetan language units are introduced in Section 2. We recall the related work
in Section 3. In Section 4, the methods which is used to build the corpus and to segment Tibetan text
into language units are described in detail. We make statistics on the corpus and list the most frequency
Tibetan language units and test Zipf?s law respectively in Section 5. Section 6 concludes this paper.
2 Language Units of Tibetan
Generally speaking, Tibetan is a alphabetic writing system. But there is a unit larger than letter but
smaller than syllable, which is different from other language such as English and Chinese. Meanwhile,
people have used different terms (in English) to express the same unit or the same term to express
different units. So we must make a clarification in this Section.
2.1 Letter, Character and Super Character
There are 30 consonants and 4 vowel signs in modern Tibetan. Several other consonants and vowel signs
are also used in Tibetan text to transliterate Sanskrit script. There are only 4 vowel signs (writing) for
the vowels (reading) /e/, /i/, /o/ and /u/, but there isn?t any signs for the vowel /a/, so every consonant has

an inherent vowel /a/. Other vowels can be indicated using a variety of diacritics which appear above or
below the main letter. Each of these consonants and vowel signs is called a ?letter?.
In Tibetan encoding schema used in ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode standard (Consortium, 2013), each
Tibetan consonant has two or even more code points to denote its normal form or subjoined form, or
other variant forms which are only used in very special context. Each variant form is called a ?character?
corresponding to a code point in ISO/IEC 10646. In Figure 1, seven characters form a Tibetan syllable.
Note that three consonants and a vowel sign are clustered.
Different from the encoding schema with small unit used in ISO/IEC 10646, in Chinese notional stan-
dard GB/T 20542 and GB/T 22238 on Tibetan coded character set and some legacy Tibetan encodings,
another encoding schema is used. In this schema, the cluster of consonants and vowel sign in Figure 1
is assigned only one code point. Figure 2 shows the schema. The encoding unit shown in Figure 2 is
called ??? ? (Zi Ding) in Chinese but the Chinese term doesn?t have an exact English translation, and
we call it ?super character? or ?super char? briefly in this paper.
2.2 Syllable, Word and Sentence
A syllable contains one or up to seven character(s). Syllables are separated by a marker known as
?tsheg?, which is simply a superscripted dot. People sometime use the Chinese term ?? ? (Zi, exactly a
character in Chinese script) to denote ?syllable?. The term ?? ? is often translated to ?word? in English.
But ?word? mainly used to express a larger language unit as an item in the vocabulary. So we use the
term ?syllable? in this paper, and take ?word? as a larger language unit which is made up of one or more
syllables and has meanings.
Note that in Tibetan ?tsheg? is used as the delimiter between two syllables. But there is no another
delimiter to mark the boundary between two words. Thus there is a lack of word boundaries in Tibetan.
Figure 3 shows the structure of a Tibetan word which is made up of two syllables and means ?show? or
?exhibition?.
In Tibetan text, some monosyllable words, including ???, ???, ???, ????, ????, ??? (We call them
abbreviation markers (AM) in this paper), can glue to the previous word without a syllable delimiter
?tsheg?, which produce many abbreviated syllables. For example, when the genitive case word ???
follows the word ?????? (king), we don?t put a ?tsheg? between them and get the fused form ????????
(king[+genitive]). The existence of abbreviated syllables contributes to the difficulty to segment Tibetan
sentence into words.
Tibetan sentence contains one or more phrase(s), which contain one or more words. Another marker
known as ?shed? indicates the sentence boundary, which looks like a vertical pipe. Figure 4 shows a
Tibetan sentence and its translation in English.

3 Related Work
In the early 1930s, G. K. Zipf pointed out a statistical feature of large language corpora ( both written
texts and speech streams ) which, remarkably, is observed in many languages, and for different authors
and styles (Zipf, 1935). He noticed that the number of words w(n) which occur exactly n times in a
language corpus varies with n as w(n) ? 1/n
?
, where the exponent is close to 2, which results in the
well known Zipf?s law. The general form of Zipf?s law states that:
y = f(r) =
C
r
?
(1)
where ? is a positive parameter close to 1.
Zipf showed that, by and large, his law held for words, syllables and morphemes. Consequently, it
is natural to ask if the law also holds for pairs of words. Egghe devised a mathematical argument that
it, in fact, does not, but that the exact relation can be approximated by a power law (Egghe, 1999). He
extended his investigations to parts of words, namely to the study of N-grams (Egghe, 2000).
Zipfs law was the source of a lively debate related to the structure of DNA. It was claimed (Mantegna
et al., 1994) that Zipf?s law shows the difference between coding and non-coding DNA as non-coding
(so-called junk) DNA fits Zipf?s law much better than coding DNA. This would mean, according to the
authors, that non-coding regions of DNA may carry new biological information. Yet, this does not mean
that junk DNA is a kind of language. Other scientists (Chatzidimitriou-Dreismann et al., 1996), however,
have shown that this distinction is not universal and lacks all biological basis.
Zipf?s law has been tested on the Internet. It turned out that popularity of Internet pages is described
according to Zipf?s law. This fact can be used to design better cache tables (Masaki and Takahashi,
1998; Breslau et al., 1998; Adamic and Huberman, 2002). Zipf?s studies on city sizes still lead to new
developments in geographical and economical studies (Gabaix, 1999a; Gabaix, 1999b; Okuyama et al.,
1999; Ioannides and Overman, 2003; Soo, 2005; Soo, 2007).
Back to text, Li (1992) found that the distribution of word frequencies for randomly generated texts is
very similar to Zipf?s law observed in natural languages such as English (Li, 1992). Ha et al. (2002)
investigated the law for two languages English and Mandarin and for n-gram word phrases as well as for
single words. The law for single words is shown to be valid only for high frequency words. However,
when single word and n-gram phrases are combined together in one list and put in order of frequency the
combined list follows Zipf?s law accurately for all words and phrases, down to the lowest frequencies in
both languages. The Zipf curves for the two languages are then almost identical (Ha et al., 2002).
In recent years, researchers also made statistics on Tibetan. Jiang and Dong (1994) made statistics
on the length and different structural mode of Tibetan syllables, and counted up the number of initial
clusters and finals of Tibetan syllables, as well as the number of Tibetan letters at different positions in
syllables (Jiang and Dong, 1994; Jiang and Dong, 1995). In a further research Jiang (1998; Jiang and
Kong (2006; Jiang and Long (2010) , they made statistics on Tibetan letters, and found that the 1th order
and 2nd order entropy of Tibetan is 3.9913 bits and 1.2531 bits resplectively (Jiang, 1998), while on
super character they are 4.82 and 3.12 (Jiang and Kong, 2006; Jiang and Long, 2010). Wang and Chen
(2004) made similar research to calculate the frequency and information entropy of Tibetan character and
syllable based on a corpus of 20, 000, 000 characters, and discovered that the most frequent 703 Tibetan
syllables cover 90% of the corpus (Wang and Chen, 2004). She also presented the research on the
frequency-rank relation of Tibetan super character and syllable, and found that the distributions follow
Zipf?s law too (Wang, 2004). But no further research is reported on whether she tests Zipf?s law on larger
language units of Tibetan. Other researchers also made statistics on Tibetan syllable?s structural mode
based a static corpus such as syllable list or dictionary (Gao and Gong, 2005; Ai et al., 2009). Lu et al.
(2003) presented the theories and approaches to calculate the frequencies of Tibetan characters, pieces,
syllables and words based on a large scale Tibetan corpus including about 40, 000, 000 syllables (Lu et
al., 2003). However, a large part of the corpus they used are Buddhist literatures and the work can?t be
done well without a pragmatic Tibetan word segmentation tool (Chen et al., 2003a; Chen et al., 2003b;
Jiang, 2006; Jiang and Kong, 2006; Sun et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2010; Lu and Shi, 2011; Liu et al.,
2012a).
324
At present, people already find methods to build a large scale corpus from Tibetan web sites with low
cost. Liu et al. (2012b) presented their method to extract the title, content, author and other useful infor-
mation of articles from several news and broadcasting web sites (Liu et al., 2012b). It?s not a difficult
work to implement a pragmatic Tibetan word segmentation tool based on the former researches (Chen
et al., 2003a; Chen et al., 2003b; Sun et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012a) So it?s time to make
statistics on the frequency distribution of larger language units such as word and n-gram word phrase for
Tibetan to see whether they follow Zipf?s law.
4 Methods and Corpus
We present our methods to build the corpus and to segment Tibetan text into different units mentioned
above.
4.1 Building a Large Scale Tibetan Text Corpus
Previously Liu et al. (2012b) proposed an approach to build a large scale text corpus for Tibetan natural
language processing. We adopt the method to build our corpus. we crawled eight Tibetan websites
which mainly focus on news and broadcastings. Topic pages but hub pages are selected with a rule based
method by checking the url. We analysed the layout structure mode of each web site and built templates
to extract topic title, publishing date, author, topic content and some other topic related informations.
Consequently, a large scale Tibetan text corpus is built, which includes about 190 thousands doc-
uments, 67.21 million words, 93.66 million syllables and 265 million super characters in total. The
sources and scales in different units are shown in Table 1.

Table 1: the sources and scales of the corpus.
It?s a heavy task to manually classify those document into domains. However, we still can
get the domain information for a certain subsets of the corpus. For some web sites listed above,
we can get the domain information from the URL of each web page. For instance, the URL
?http://tb.chinatibetnews.com/xzmeishi/2011-12/05/content 831210.htm? shows it belongs to a column
called ?xzmeishi?. so it must be a page about Tibetan foods, because ?xz? is the abbreviated form of
Chinese word ?xizang? (?? ), which means the Tibetan Autonomous Region, while ?meishi? means
?delicious food?. So we can classify the documents in the corpus into domains. Table 2 and 3 list the
domains of subsets of the documents from two web sites named ?China Tibet News? and ?Tibetan?s web
of China? respectively. Obviously, a large part of the documents in the corpus are news as expected,
because nearly all of the 8 web sites are hold by news agencies or radio stations.
4.2 Methods to Segment Tibetan Text
As described in section 2, there is a delimiter between two Tibetan syllables. So we can segment the
text into syllables by adding segmentation mark after the delimiter. The encoding schema can be used to
segment text into smaller language units.
The challenge lies in the word segmentation. With a similar method to those methods proposed by
other researchers (Chen et al., 2003a; Chen et al., 2003b; Jiang and Kong, 2006; Sun et al., 2009; Sun
et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2012a), we implemented a segmenter. As mentioned in Section 2.2, some mono-
syllable words can glue to the previous word without a syllable delimiter ?tsheg?, which produce many

abbreviated syllables. So Tibetan has a significant number of complex words where the sounds have
been synthesized due to internal sandhi something like Sanskrit. As some of those abbreviated syllables
can also be used as normal syllables, they lead to considerable problem in Tibetan word segmentation.
So in the first step, we analyse the structure of each syllable in the sentence, and break them into normal
syllables and abbreviated mark candidates and take them as the basic units (unbreakable units). Then, in
the second step, some special case-auxiliary words ( which are all monosyllable words ) are used as sepa-
rators to break the sentence into blocks. Consequently, both the forward maximum matching method and
backward maximum matching method are used to segment each block into words. Mean while, it detects
ambiguities by bidirectional segmentation, and makes disambiguation with word frequency. A previous
research shows that the precision of this method reaches 96.98% (Liu et al., 2012a). The following
example shows the main procedure of the method.
Input: ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Translation: We have always followed the principles of socialist public ownership and distribution
according to work.
Step 1: ?? (? ??) ?? ???? ??? ???? ?? ?? ?? ???? (? ??) ??? ???? ??? ??? ???? ??? ??? ?? ?? ??? ???? ?????
??? ?? ?
Step 2: (?? ? ?? ?? ???? ??? ????) ?? (?? ?? ???? ? ?? ??? ???? ??? ??? ???? ??? ???) ?? (?? ??? ????
????? ??? ??) ?
Step 3: (?? ?) (??) (?? ???? ??? ????) ?? (?? ?? ???? ? ?? ???) (????) (???) (???) (????) (???) (???) ??
(?? ???) (???? ?????) (??? ??) ?
Output: ??? ?? ????????????? ?? ?????????????? ???? ??? ??? ???? ??? ??? ?? ????? ????????? ????? ?
326
Note that, in step 1, two abbreviated syllable candidates are found and given in parentheses. In step 2,
the two occurrences of the case-auxiliary word ?? break the sentence into several blocks, and each block
is segmented into words consequently in step 3. In this paper, as we mainly focus on Tibetan text, so in
the segmentation, all Latin words, Latin numbers, Chinese phrases, Tibetan alphabetic numbers such as
? ??????? ? (6331089) and so on are all replaced by place-holders.
4.3 Counting and Calculation
The SRI Language Modelling Toolkit (SRILM) (Stolcke and others, 2002) is used to count the frequen-
cies in our work.
5 Statistical Data and Analysis
In this section, we show the statistical data and check whether the frequency-rank on the units of super
character, syllable and word follows Zipf?s law respectively. As there isn?t many enough items in the
frequency list, we won?t check it on the units of letter and character. For the other units, the number of
occurrences of each n-gram is listed in Table 4.

Table 4: Number of occurrences of each Tibetan n-gram in different units in the corpus.
5.1 Letter Frequency
In total, Tibetan 83 letters are used in the corpus, of which 39 letters are consonants and 8 letters are
vowel signs. Letter ? and ? didn?t occur in the corpus, which means people might prefer to use two
letters to spell each of them. The other are Tibetan punctuations and signs. There are also 200 non
Tibetan characters used in the corpus. The 47 letters and the two delimiters are listed in Table 5. The
character ?P?, ?C? and ?V? in the table denote ?Punctuation?, ?Consonant? and ?Vowel? respectively.
The ?theg? shares 23.45% of the corpus while the ?thed? shares 1.33%, which shows that a syllable has
3.26 letters (not including the ?theg? itself), while a sentence has 75.40 letters in average. 4 of the 8
vowels occur frequently while the other 4 vowels are rarely used. The 2 punctuations share 24.7762% of
the corpus while 4 vowels in modern Tibetan share 16.0805%, and the 30 consonants in modern Tibetan
share 58.3918%. All these 36 letters share 99.2485% of the corpus in total. The other 4 vowels and 9
consonants which is used to transliterate Sanskrit script are rarely used. They share only 0.0437%. Other
Tibetan signs and non Tibetan characters share 0.7078%.
5.2 Character Frequency
There are 119 Tibetan characters used in the corpus in total, including Tibetan punctuations and signs,
but Tibetan number is replaced with a place-holder. As there are 83 letters as described in the former
subsection, the other 36 characters are the second or third forms of Tibetan consonants. As the frequency
of Tibetan character is seldom a concerned issue, we don?t make any further remarks on it.
5.3 Super Character Frequency
There are 1,466 super characters used in the corpus in total. The topmost frequently occurred super
characters and n-gram super char phrases for n = 2, 3 are listed in Table 6. As expected, the ?theg? is
the most frequently occurred one when we take it as a super character, which shares 31.22%. It indicates
that a syllable is formed by 2.20 super characters in average. The ?theg? shares 1.5837%, which indicates
that a sentence has 63.14 super characters in average.

Table 6: The topmost frequently occurred super characters and n-gram super char phrases.
The frequency-rank curves of the n-gram for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are plotted with log-log axes in Figure
5. A straight line with slop = ?1.0 is also plotted in the figure. It?s obvious that the curves don?t follow
Zipf?s law so exactly. The high frequency parts of the curves follow Zipf?s law at large, but as the rank
increases the curves have more rapid decreases than a linear curve with slop = ?1.0 when the rank
> 100. However, we still found that the curve becomes more straight when the n increases.
Similar to Ha et al. (2002), we also combine the frequency list of the n-grams for all n = 1, 2, . . . , 5
together in one list and put in order of frequency. The frequency-rank curve is plotted in Figure 6. A
straight line with slope= ?1.0 is also plotted in the figure, which shows that there are large gaps between
