Abstract
Recent TREC results have demonstrated the
need for deeper text understanding methods.
This paper introduces the idea of automated
reasoning applied to question answering and
shows the feasibility of integrating a logic
prover into a Question Answering system. The
approach is to transform questions and answer
passages into logic representations. World
knowledge axioms as well as linguistic ax-
ioms are supplied to the prover which renders
a deep understanding of the relationship be-
tween question text and answer text. Moreover,
the trace of the proofs provide answer justifica-
tions. The results show that the prover boosts
the performance of the QA system on TREC
questions by 30%.
1 Introduction
Motivation
In spite of significant advances made recently in the
Question Answering technology, there still remain many
problems to be solved. Some of these are: bridging the
gap between question and answer words, pinpointing ex-
act answers, taking into consideration syntactic and se-
mantic roles of words, better answer ranking, answer jus-
tification, and others. The recent TREC results (Voorhees
2002) have demonstrated that many performing systems
reached a plateau; the systems ranked from 4th to 14th
answered correctly between 38.4% to 24.8% of the total
number of questions. It is clear that new ideas based on
a deeper language understanding are necessary to push
further the QA technology.
In this paper we introduce one such novel idea, the use
of automated reasoning in QA, and show that it is fea-
sible, effective, and scalable. We have implemented a
Logic Prover, called COGEX (from the permutation of
the first two syllables of the verb excogitate) which uni-
formly codifies the question and answer text, as well as
world knowledge resources, in order to use its inference
engine to verify and extract any lexical relationships be-
tween the question and its candidate answers.
Usefulness of a Logic Prover in QA
COGEX captures the syntax-based relationships such as
the syntactic objects, syntactic subjects, prepositional at-
tachments, complex nominals, and adverbial/adjectival
adjuncts provided by the logic representation of text. In
addition to the logic representations of questions and can-
didate answers, the QA Logic Prover needs world knowl-
edge axioms to link question concepts to answer con-
cepts. These axioms are provided by the WordNet glosses
represented in logic forms. Additionally, the prover needs
rewriting procedures for semantically equivalent lexical
patterns. With this deep and intelligent representation,
COGEX effectively and efficiently re-ranks candidate an-
swers by their correctness, extracts the exact answer, and
ultimately eliminates incorrect answers. In this way, the
Logic Prover is a powerful tool in boosting the accuracy
of the QA system. Moreover, the trace of a proof consti-
tutes a justification for that answer.
Technical challenges
The challenges one faces when using automated reason-
ing in the context of NLP include: logic representation
of open text, need of world knowledge axioms, logic rep-
resentation of semantically equivalent linguistic patterns,
and others. Logic proofs are accurate but costly, both in
terms of high failure rate due to insufficient input axioms,
as well as long processing time. Our solution is to inte-
grate the prover into the QA system and rely on reasoning
methods only to augment other previously implemented
answer extraction techniques.

2 Integration of Logic Prover into a QA
System
The QA system includes traditional modules such as
question processing, document retrieval, answer extrac-
tion, built in ontologies, as well as many tools such as
syntactic parser, name entity recognizer, word sense dis-
ambiguation (Moldovan and Noviscki 2002), logic rep-
resentation of text (Moldovan and Rus 2001) and others.
The Logic Prover is integrated in this rich NLP environ-
ment and augments the QA system operation.
As shown in Figure 1, the inputs to COGEX consist of
logic representations of questions, potential answer para-
graphs, world knowledge and lexical information. The
term Answer Logic Form (ALF) refers to the candidate
answers in logic form. Candidate answers returned by the
Answer Extraction module are classified as open text due
to the unpredictable nature of their grammatical struc-
ture. The term Question Logic Form (QLF) refers to the
questions posed to the Question Answering system rep-
resented in logic form.
The prover also needs world knowledge axioms sup-
plied by the WordNet glosses transformed into logic rep-
resentations. Additionally there are many other axioms
representing equivalence classes of linguistic patterns,
called NLP axioms. All these are described below.
The Axiom Builder converts the Logic Forms for the
question, the glosses, and its candidate answers into ax-
ioms. Based on the parse tree patterns in the question
and answers, other NLP axioms are built to supplement
the existing general NLP axioms. Once the axioms are
complete and loaded, justification of the answer begins.
If a proof fails, the relaxation module is invoked. The
purpose of this module is twofold: (1) to compensate
for errors in the text parsing and Logic Form transfor-
mation phase, such as prepositional attachments and sub-
ject/object detection in verbs, (2) to detect correct an-
swers when the NLP and XWN (Extended WordNet) ax-
ioms fail to provide all the necessary inferences. During
the relaxation, arguments to predicates in the question are
incrementally uncoupled, the proof score is reduced, and
the justification is re-attempted. The loop between the
Justification and the Relaxation modules continues until
the proof succeeds, or the proof score is below a prede-
fined threshold. When all the candidate answers are pro-
cessed, the candidate answers are ranked based on their
proof scores, with the output from COGEX being the
ranked answers and the answer justifications.
3 Logic Representation of Text
A text logic form (LF) is an intermediary step between
syntactic parse and the deep semantic form. The LF cod-
ification acknowledges syntax-based relationships such
as: (1) syntactic subjects, (2) syntactic objects, (3) prepo-
sitional attachments, (4) complex nominals, and (5) ad-
jectival/adverbial adjuncts. Our approach is to derive the
LF directly from the output of the syntactic parser which
already resolves structural and syntactic ambiguities.
Essentially there is a one to one mapping of the words
of the text into the predicates in the logic form. The pred-
icate names consist of the base form of the word concate-
nated with the part of speech of the word. Each noun
has an argument that is used to represent it in other predi-
cates. One of the most important features of the Logic
Form representation is the fixed-slot allocation mecha-
nism of the verb predicates (Hobbs 1993). This allows
for the Logic Prover to see the difference between the
role of the subjects and objects in a sentence that is not
answerable in a keyword based situation.
Logic Forms are derived from the grammar rules found
in the parse tree of a sentence. There are far too many
grammar rules in the English language to efficiently and
realistically implement them all. We have observed that
the top ten most frequently used grammar rules cover
90% of the cases for WordNet glosses. This is referred
to as the 10-90 rule (Moldovan and Rus 2001). Below
we provide a sample sentence and its corresponding LF
representation.
Example:
Heavy selling of Standard & Poor?s 500-stock index fu-
tures in Chicago relentlessly beat stocks downward.
LF:
heavy JJ(x1) & selling NN(x1) & of IN(x1,x6) &
Standard NN(x2) & & CC(x13,x2,x3) & Poor NN(x3)
&?s POS(x6,x13) & 500-stock JJ(x6) & index NN(x4)
& future NN(x5) & nn NNC(x6,x4,x5) & in IN(x1,x8)
& Chicago NN(x8) & relentlessly RB(e12) &
beat VB(e12,x1,x9) & stocks NN(x9) & down-
ward RB(e12)
4 World Knowledge Axioms
Logic representation of WordNet glosses
A major problem in QA is that often an answer is
expressed in words different from the question keywords.
World knowledge is necessary to conceptually link ques-
tions and answers. WordNet glosses contain a source of
world knowledge. To be useful in automated reasoning,
the glosses need to be transformed into logic forms.
Taking the same approach as for open text, we have
parsed and represented in logic forms more than 50,000
WordNet glosses. For example, the gloss definition of
concept sport NN#1 is an active diversion requiring
physical exertion and competition, which yields the logic
representation:
active JJ(x1) & diversion NN(x1) & re-
quire VB(e1,x1,x2) & or CC(x2,x3,x4) & physi-
cal JJ(x3) & exertion NN(x3) & competition NN(x4)

Lexical Chains
A much improved source of world knowledge is obtained
when the gloss words are semantically disambiguated
(Moldovan and Noviscki 2002). By doing this, the con-
nectivity between synsets is dramatically increased. Lex-
ical chains can be established between synsets in different
hierarchies. These are sequences of semantically related
words that link two concepts.
Lexical chains improve the performance of question
answering systems in two ways: (1) increase the docu-
ment retrieval recall and (2) improve the answer extrac-
tion by providing the much needed world knowledge ax-
ioms that link question keywords with answers concepts.
We developed software that automatically provides
connecting paths between any two WordNet synsets
 
and
 
up to a certain distance (Moldovan and Noviscki
2002). The meaning of these paths is that the concepts
along a path are topically related. The path may contain
any of the WordNet relations augmented with a GLOSS
relation which indicates that a certain concept is present
in a synset gloss.
Examples
Below we provide some relevant lexical chains that link
a few selected TREC 2002 questions with their answers.

5 NLP Axioms
In additions to world knowledge axioms, a QA Logic
Prover needs linguistic knowledge. This is what distin-
guishes an NLP prover from a traditional mathematical
prover. General axioms that reflect equivalence classes
of linguistic patterns need to be created and instantiated
when invoked. We call these NLP axioms and present
below some examples together with questions that call
them.
Complex nominals and coordinated conjunctions
A question may refer to a subject/object by its full proper
name, and the answer will refer to the subject/object in
an abbreviated form. For example in the correct candi-
date answer for the question, ?Which company created
the Internet browser Mosaic??, Internet browser Mosaic
is referred to as Mosaic.
Using abduction, an axiom is built such that the head
noun of the complex nominal in the question implies the
remaining nouns in the complex nominal:
all x1 (mosaic nn(x1)  internet nn(x1) &
browser nn(x1))
An additional axiom is built such that all the nouns in the
complex nominal imply a complex nominal:
all x1 (internet nn(x1) & browser nn(x1) & mo-
saic nn(x1)  nn nnc(x1,x1,x1,x1))
So as not to restrict the ordering of the nouns in the noun
phrase from which the complex nominal is built, the
same argument is used for each of the noun predicates
in the complex nominal. Similar to the above issue, a
question may refer to the subject/object in an abbreviated
form, while the answer will refer to the subject/object
in its full, proper form. For example in the correct
candidate answer for the question, ?When was Microsoft
established??, Microsoft is referred to as Microsoft
Corp.
An axiom is built such that each noun of the complex
nominal takes on the identifying argument of the complex
nominal:
all x1 x2 x3 ( microsoft nn(x1) & corp nn(x2) &
nn nnc(x3,x1,x2)  microsoft nn(x3) & corp nn(x3))
Similar axioms are used for coordinated conjunctions de-
tected in the answer and the question. These are consid-
ered weak axioms, and any proof that uses them will be
penalized by being given a lower score than those that do
not.
Appositions
A candidate answer for a question may use an apposition
to describe the subject/object of the answer. The ques-
tion may refer to the subject/object by this apposition.
For example in the question, ?Name the designer of the
shoe that spawned millions of plastic imitations , known
as jellies?, the candidate answer, ?..Italian Andrea Pfis-
ter , designer of the 1979 ? bird cage ? shoe that spawned
millions of plastic imitations, known as ? jellies ...? uses
an apposition to describe the designer.
An axiom is built to link the head of the noun phrases
in the apposition such that they share the same argument:
all x12 x13 x14 x15 x17 x18 x19 (ital-
ian nn(x12) & andrea nn(x13) & pfister NN(x14)
& nn nnc(x15,x12,x13,x14)  designer nn(x15) &
of in(x15,x17) & 1979 nn(x17) & bird nn(x18) &
cage nn(x19))
Possesives
A question/answer substitutes the use of a possesive by
using an of or by preposition. For example, in the ques-
tion, ?What was the length of the Wright brothers? first
flight??, the candidate answer, ?Flying machines , which
got off the ground with a 120 - foot flight by the Wright
brothers in 1903...? implies ownership using the preposi-
tion by to connect the Wright brothers to flight.
An axiom is built to connect by to the possessive:
all x1 x2 (by in(x1,x2)  pos(x1,x2))
Equivalence classes for prepositions
Prepositions can be grouped into equivalence classes de-
pending on the context of the question, which is deter-
mined by the expected answer type. In location seeking
questions the prepositions at and in are often interchange-
able. Similarly for in and into, and from and of. In date
seeking questions in and of have interchangeable mean-
ings as do at and in. For example, in the question, ?What
body of water does the Colorado River flow into??, the
candidate answer, ?...the Colorado River flowed in the
Salton trough about 130 miles east of San Diego?, the
preposition in and into in the answer take in the same
meaning.
An axiom is built to link in to into:
all x1 x2 (in in(x1,x2)  into in(x1,x2))
Part of relations in location questions
A location seeking question may have a candidate
answer that identifies a location by referring to a part of
the location. For example, in the question, ?Where is
Devil ?s Tower??, the answer, ?American Indians won
another court battle over their right to worship without
interference at Devils Tower National Monument in the
northeast corner of Wyoming?, identifies Wyoming as
the location of Devil ?s Tower by referring to the part of
Wyoming in which it lies. An axiom is built to connect
Wyoming to its part:
all x1 x2 x3 (corner nn(x1) & of in(x1,x2) &
wyoming nn(x2)  wyoming nn(x1) )
Attribute of relations in quantity seeking questions
A question seeking a quantity may have a candidate an-
swer that implies quantity of subject by prefixing the
quantity to the subject. For example in the question
?What is the height of the tallest redwood?? the answer is
?329 feet Mother of Forest?s Big Basin tallest redwood..?
An axiom is built to connect the quantity to its subject,
redwood:
all x1 x2 ( quantity(x1) & redwood NN(x2) 
of in(x1,x2))
This is a weak axiom since the proximity of redwood to
quantity in the answer text is not guaranteed. As men-
tioned for the complex nominal and coordinated conjunc-
tion axioms, any proof that uses these axioms should be
penalized and ranked lower than those that do not. Note
that for this axiom to be effective, an axiom linking the
heads of the apposition is built:
all x8 x9 x10 x11 x12 (mother nn(x8) & of in(x8,x9)
& forest nn(x9)  big nn(x10) & basin nn(x11) &
nn nnc(x12,x10,x11) & s pos(x8,x12) & tall jj(x8) &
redwood nn(x8))
6 Control Strategy
Axiom partitioning mechanism
The search strategy used is the Set of Support Strategy,
which partitions the axioms used during the course of
a proof into those that have support and those that are
considered auxiliary (Wos 1988). The axioms with sup-
port are placed in the Set of Support (SOS) list and are
intended to guide the proof. The auxiliary axioms are
placed in the Usable list and are used to help the SOS
infer new clauses. This strategy restricts the search such
that a new clause is inferred if and only if one of its par-
ent clauses come from the Set of Support. The axioms
that are placed in the SOS are the candidate answers, the
question negated (to invoke the proof by contradiction),
and axioms related to linking named entities to answer
types.
Axioms placed in the Usable list are: (1) Extended
WordNet axioms, (2) NLP axioms, and (3) axioms based
on outside world knowledge, such as people and organi-
zations.
Inference rules
The inference rule sets are based on hyperresolution and
paramodulation. Hyperresolution is an inference rule that
does multiple binary resolution steps in one, where bi-
nary resolution is an inference mechanism that looks for
a positive literal in one clause and negative form of that
same literal in another clause such that the two literals
can be canceled, resulting in a newly inferred clause.
Paramodulation introduces the notion of equality substi-
tution so that axioms representing equality in the proof
do not need to be explicitly included in the axiom lists.
Additionally, similar to hyperresolution, paramodulation
combines multiple substitution steps into one.
All modern theorem provers use hyperresolution and
paramodulation inference rules since they allow for a
more compact and efficient proof by condensing multi-
ple steps into one.
COGEX will continue trying to find a proof until the
Set of Support becomes empty, a refutation is found, or
the proof score drops below a predefined threshold.
Two techniques have been implemented in COGEX to
deal with incomplete proofs:
1. Count the number of unifications/resolutions with
terms in the question along the longest search path in the
proof attempts, and
2. Relax the question logic form by incrementally un-
coupling arguments in the predicates, and/or removing
prepositions or modifiers that are not crucial to the mean-
ing of the text.
For example in question, ?How far is Yaroslavl from
Moscow?? a candidate answer is ?.. Yaroslavl, a city 250
miles north of Moscow.? By dropping the from predicate
in the question makes the proof succeed for the candidate
answer.
7 An example
The following example illustrates how all these pieces are
put together to generate answer proofs.
Question 108?:

QLF:

& search vb(e5,x2,x22) & portion nn(x22) &
of in(x22,x23) & internet nn(x23)).
Named entity axioms:
(1) all x3 x4 x5 x6 x7 x8 (national nn(x3) &
center nn(x4) & for nn(x5) & supercomputing nn(x6)
& application nn(x7) & nn nnc(x8,x3,x4,x5,x6,x7) 

university at(x15)).
(3) all x16 (champaign nn(x16)  town at(x16)).
Wordnet Gloss axioms:
The question contained the verb create while the answer
contains the verb develop. In order to prove that this
answer is in fact correct, we need to detect and use a
lexical chain between develop and create. WordNet
supplies us with that chain such that
develop  make and make  create
Using WordNet glosses, this chain is transformed into
two axioms:
(4) exists x2 x3 x4 all e2 x1 x7 (develop vb(e2,x7,x1) 
make vb(e2,x7,x1) & something nn(x1) & new jj(x1)
& such jj(x1) & product nn(x2) & or cc(x4,x1,x3) &
mental jj(x3) & artistic jj(x3) & creation nn(x3)).
(5) all e1 x1 x2 (make vb(e1,x1,x2)  cre-
ate vb(e1,x1,x2) & manufacture vb(e1,x1,x2) &
man-made jj(x2) & product nn(x2)).
Furthermore, the question asks about the Internet
browser Mosiac, while the candidate answer refers to
Mosaic. To provide the knowledge that the Internet
browser Mosaic refers to the same thing as Mosaic, the
head of the complex nominal, Internet browser Mosaic,
implies its remaining components.
(6) all x1 (mosaic nn(x1)  internet nn(x1) &

(7) all x1 x2 x3 x4 (mosaic nn(x1) & internet nn(x1) &

The next step is to build the Set of Support Axiom(s) for
the Question. The question is negated to invoke the proof
by contradiction

pany nn(x2) & create vb(e1,x2,x6) & internet nn(x3) &
browser(x4) & mosaic nn(x5) & nn nnc(x6,x3,x4,x5))).
Next, link the answer type term, its modifiers, and any
prepositional attachments to the answer type as a substi-
tute for more refined named entity recognition.

It remains to create axioms for the ALF of the candidate
answer and to start the proof.

The numbers on the left hand side of the proof summary
indicate the step number in the search, not the step
number in the proof. Through step 332 we see that
COGEX has selected all the axioms it needs to prove
that the candidate answer is correct for the question
posed to the QA system. Steps 335 through 374 show
hyperresolutions that result in all the terms of the
question being derived in their positive form so the proof
by contradiction succeeds, which is indicated by the $F
in the final step and the hyperresolution of all the derived
terms with the negated question from step 1 of the proof.
The success of this proof boosts the candidate answer to
the first position.
When the proof fails, we devised a way to incremen-
tally relax some of the conditions that hinder the comple-
tion of the proof. This relaxation process puts weights
on the proof such that proofs weaker than a predefined
threshold are not accepted.
8 Results
COGEX was implemented and integrated into a state-of-
the-art Question Answering system that participated in
TREC 2002. All questions are attempted by the prover,
but if the proof fails the QA system resorts to other an-
swer extraction methods that were part of the system be-
fore the prover. Thus, some questions are answered by
the QA system without the prover, some only by the
prover and some by both the non-prover system and the
prover. The complete system answered 415 questions out
of 500 TREC 2002 questions. Of these, 206 were an-
swered by COGEX but some of these answers were also
provided by QA system without COGEX. A careful anal-
ysis indicates that the QA system without logic prover an-
swered 317 questions and the prover can answer only 98
additional questions for which the system without prover
failed. Table 1 summarizes these results.
Questions answered by the complete system 415
Questions answered by COGEX 206
Questions answered only by COGEX 98
Questions answered without COGEX 317
Table 1: Performance over 500 TREC 2002 questions
The added value of automated reasoning to the QA sys-
tem is 30.9% (98/317). This represents a significant im-
provement in the performance of the logic prover for QA
over the one reported in (Moldovan 2002). The failures
of the prover are due primarily to the lack of linguistic
axioms.
9 Discussion
A logic prover brings several advantages to question an-
swering, but at a high cost. Some advantages are: the ca-
pability of pinpointing exact answers that otherwise will
be missed, answer justification, and a quantifiable mea-
sure of how close a system is to providing an answer.
However, the implementation of a QA logic prover is ex-
pensive as it requires logic representation of text, world
knowledge axioms and a large number of linguistic ax-
ioms, that all take time to develop.
