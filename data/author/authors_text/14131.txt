Abstract 
 
This paper describes sociological 
fieldwork conducted in the autumn of 
2008 in eleven rural communities of South 
Africa. The goal of the fieldwork was to 
evaluate the potential role of automated 
telephony services in improving access to 
important government information and 
services. Our interviews, focus group 
discussions and surveys revealed that 
Lwazi, a telephone-based spoken dialog 
system, could greatly support current 
South African government efforts to 
effectively connect citizens to available 
services, provided such services be toll 
free, in local languages, and with content 
relevant to each community.  
 
1  Introduction 
There is a growing interest in deploying spoken 
dialog systems (SDSs) in developing regions. In 
rural communities of developing regions, where 
infrastructure, distances, language and literacy 
are barriers to access, but where mobile phones 
are prevalent, an SDS could be key to unlocking 
social and economic growth (Barnard et al, 
2003). Some notable recent studies in this field 
include ?Tamil Market? (Plauch? et al, 2006) 
and ?VoiKiosk? (Agarwal et al, 2008). Both 
were kiosk-based SDSs providing agricultural 
information that were tested in rural, semi-
literate communities in India. Nasfors (2007) 
also developed an agricultural information 
service, aimed at mobile telephone users in 
Kenya. ?Healthline? was evaluated by a small 
set of community health workers in Pakistan 
(Sherwani et al, 2007), who had trouble with the 
voice-based interface, presumably due to their 
limited literacy. In a more recent study, Sharma 
et al (2008) evaluated a SDS designed for 
caregivers of HIV positive children in Botswana. 
The researchers found that the users performed 
equally well using touchtone as speech input, 
when navigating the system. In the current paper, 
we expand on this body of work by investigating 
the potential role for SDSs in connecting rural 
citizens of South Africa with government 
services, such as free education opportunities and 
stipends.   
South Africa is the leader in Information and 
Communications Technology (ICT) in Africa 
and has the most developed telecommunications 
network on the continent (SA year book 
2006/2007: 131). In particular, mobile phone 
usage has experienced massive growth due in 
part to its accessibility by non-literate people and 
its ?leapfrog? development, which skipped the 
interim solutions adopted in the developed world 
(Tongia & Subrahmanian, 2006). The amount of 
mobile phone users in South Africa is an 
astonishing 30 million people - out of a total 
population of 47 million (Benjamin, 2007). The 
percentage of both rural and urban households 
with mobile phones tripled from 2001 to 2007, 
while ?landline? use declined. The accessibility 
and widespread use of mobile phones make 
SDSs a good candidate for low-cost information 
access. 
In South Africa, there are eleven official 
languages. Private companies, NGOs and 
government offices who wish to reach South 
Africans through print or audio, find it extremely 
costly to do so for each language. Heugh (2007) 
shows that in terms of speakers' proficiency, 
there is no single lingua franca for South 
Africans (see Figure 1). In fact, in 2001, only 3 
million of 44 million South Africans were 
English speakers, the language in which most 
government messages are currently disseminated 
(Household survey 2001).

Figure 1: Percentage of speakers per language in 
South Africa. 
 
 
Heugh (2007) reports that between 35% and 
45% of South Africans above the age of 16 
cannot read or write. Illiteracy is 
disproportionately high for women and for 
people living in the primarily rural provinces: 
KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo and Mpumalanga. 
Mobile phone use is widespread in these areas 
among semi-literate citizens and speakers of all 
languages.  
Communities in rural areas struggle to access 
government services due to their remote 
locations. Most community members must travel 
long distances by foot or rare and costly public 
transport to access basic services. In their 
longitudinal household study on costs and 
coping strategies with chronic illnesses, Goudge 
et al (2007), for example, found that people in 
rural areas of South Africa do not go to free 
health care facilities because they cannot afford 
transport.  
NGOs face the same challenge when trying to 
reach rural populations. Many produce 
information to assist households affected by 
HIV/AIDS, for example, but most of the 
materials are published on websites; the cost of 
providing multilingual print materials is often 
too high. Due to low literacy levels, language, 
and a lack of infrastructure, the information 
remains inaccessible to the people who need it, 
especially those living in rural areas and 
townships (Benjamin, 2007).  
Given the well developed mobile phone 
network and the relatively sparse alternative 
options in rural South Africa, the authors believe 
that multilingual SDSs can provide a low-cost 
solution to improving the ICT access of citizens 
who may currently be excluded from 
government services due to language, literacy 
and location. However, it is imperative to 
understand the target users and their 
environmental context as a first step to designing 
such a system (Nielsen, 1993). In this paper, we 
provide background on the current state of rural 
government service delivery in South Africa and 
introduce the Lwazi project. We describe our 
field methods, and finally, we present our 
findings from the initial field work with design 
and deployment implications for the Lwazi 
system. 
2.  Background 
In South Africa, rural citizens are faced with a 
lack of economic activities and limited access to 
resources.  The South African government is 
aware of both the need to improve citizen access 
to services and the specific challenges that rural 
communities face.   
In this section, we note two successful rural 
initiatives of the South African government 
(Section 2.1) and we describe Lwazi (Section 
2.2), a SDS designed to augment government?s 
accessibility by eligible citizens.  
2.1 Rural Initiatives in South Africa 
Two national efforts that are successfully 
connecting rural South African citizens to 
government services are (1) The Thusong 
Service Centres (TSCs) and (2) Community 
Development Workers (CDWs).  
 Thusong Service Centres (TSCs), formerly 
known as MPCC (Multi-Purpose Community 
Centres), were initiated in 1999 as a national 
initiative to integrate government services into 
primarily rural communities, where services and 
participation by citizens was limited due to the 
long distances they needed to travel (TSC 2008). 
In June 7, 2008, the 100th TSC was opened. Each 
TSC is a one-stop centre providing integrated 
services and information from government to 
rural community members close to where they 
live. 
 Community Development Workers (CDWs) 
were formed in 2004 as a national initiative to 
further bridge the gap between government 
services and eligible citizens, especially the rural 
poor (CDW 2008). CDWs are members of rural 
communities who are trained and employed by 
the Department of Public Service and 
Administration (DPSA) under the office of the 
presidency. They work within their communities 
and coordinate with municipal and provincial 
offices. The primary responsibilities of a CDW is 
60
 to keep informed, notify citizens about events, 
and inform them about services for which they 
are eligible then follow up to ensure they 
successfully receive these services. 
2.2 Project Lwazi 
As part of the ICT initiative, an ambitious, three-
year project is currently being conducted by the 
Human Language Technology (HLT) research 
group under the Meraka institute, at the Council 
for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in 
South Africa. This project is funded by the South 
African Department of Arts and Culture to 
develop a multilingual telephone-based SDS that 
would assist South African government service 
delivery. ?Lwazi,? derived from the IsiZulu 
word for knowledge, aims to make a positive 
impact in the daily lives of South Africans by 
connecting them to government and health 
services (Lwazi, 2008). The ability of SDSs to 
overcome barriers of language, literacy, and 
distances led the Lwazi team to explore a low-
cost application that would support the current 
rural initiatives mentioned in 2.1. 
3. Method 
First, we consulted previous research on 
development and technology in South and 
Southern Africa. We reviewed the most recent 
census conducted (Statistics SA, 2007) for data 
on infrastructure, income, language, and 
technology use.  
Then, eleven communities were visited by 
small, interdisciplinary teams of researchers over 
a period of 3 months in 2008.  Of these eleven 
centres, two were in peri-urban societies another 
two in urban and the rest were based in rural 
communities (Table 1).  In each visit, the Lwazi 
team gained access to the community through 
the Thusong Service Centres (TSC?s) manager.  
These individuals provided materials, office 
space, and meetings with CDWs and key people 
at the TSC.   
We conducted between one and five key 
informant interviews at each site with the TSC 
employees, CDWs, and community members. In 
four of the eleven sites, we also conducted a 
focus group discussion. In two sites, we 
shadowed a CDW during a typical day. We 
visited farms, day-care centres, churches, 
markets, youth centres, clinics, businesses and 
households.

Table 1: Sites visited in Spring 2008. 
 
Data collection in these communities was 
primarily to investigate the suitability of the 
Lwazi SDS and to determine key user and 
contextual factors that would drive its design. In 
particular, we sought to:  
 
? Gather rural community information needs.  
? Investigate how people currently get 
information.   
? Determine which cultural factors would 
impact the Lwazi system.   
? Determine level of technical competency.   
? Gauge interest in a low-cost SDS that 
improves access to government services.   
4. Results 
In this section, we present our overall results 
from field visits in eleven communities of South 
Africa (Section 4.1). In particular, we report on 
factors that influence the design and potential 
uptake of the Lwazi system in this context: the 
information needs and sources (Section 4.2), 
cultural and social factors (Section 4.3), 
suitability of the technology (Section 4.4), and 
user experience (Section 4.5). 
4.1  Overall Results 
The eleven communities we visited were located 
throughout seven of the nine provinces of South 
Africa. They varied greatly in available 
infrastructure and languages spoken. They shared 
an economic dependency on nearby cities and, in 
61
 some cases, reported social problems. These 
communities also share a dependency on 
government social grants.   
During interviews and focus group 
discussions with government employees and 
community members, interviewees identified 
what they perceived as the primary problems in 
their communities. Across all eleven sites 
visited, unemployment was most often reported 
as the primary problem (Figure 2). In fact, our 
team observed that in at least 8 of the sites 
visited, the community's livelihood was entirely 
sustained by government grants.  
After unemployment, access to health and 
social services was viewed as a primary problem 
in six of the sites visited. Crime and substance 
abuse were also reported as community 
problems.

There are four mobile providers in South Africa 
namely Cell-C, MTN, Virgin Mobile and 
Vodacom.  The two landline companies, Neo-tell 
and Telkom are not familiar in the communities 
visited by Lwazi team. Community members 
prefer and use mobile phones because of ease of 
use and accessibility.  Figure 3 illustrates the use 
of mobile providers in the eleven visited 
communities.

4.2. Information Needs and Sources 
The majority of communities visited reported 
lack of economic activity as the primary problem 
in the community, and as could be expected, we 
observed very high levels of unemployment. 
Grants are offered by the South African 
government to address the imbalance and 
stimulate the economy of these areas. There are 
six types of grants, namely: War Veteran grant, 
Old Age grant, Disability grant, Care 
dependency grant, Foster care grant and Child 
support grant.  Citizens can apply for these at 
their nearest local South African social security 
agency (SASSA) or district office.  
Figure 4 shows that all eleven communities 
visited received Vukuzenzele magazine, a 
monthly government information sharing 
medium. This is however not effective in these 
communities where literacy levels are low. This, 
as mentioned earlier, is one of the problems the 
government is trying to address. The second 
commonly used source of information was the 
CDWs. This is a useful source because they are 
the ?foot soldiers? of the government; they are 
responsible for door to door visits, collecting and 
delivering information.

Figure 4: sources of government information  
 
At the time of the visits, the eleven communities 
received information from the Thusong Service 
Centres. Government departments, NGOs, 
municipalities and research institutes such the 
CSIR, used the TSCs as a platform to 
disseminate information.  At a more grass roots 
level, African communities in South Africa share 
information by word of mouth.   Local radio 
stations and newspapers in local languages are 
also important sources of information.  
4.3 Cultural and Social Factors 
The population in the communities we visited 
consists mostly of older people taking care of 
grandchildren whose parents work in nearby 
62
 cities and visit only once or twice a year.  As we 
have previously mentioned, the lack of economic 
activity means that these communities depend 
heavily on government social grants. Older 
people in these communities are often unable to 
read and write. In some cases, their low literacy 
levels and possible unfamiliarity with 
technology restricts their ability to use the 
cheaper ?texting? feature of their mobile phones. 
In the communities we visited, ten out of the 
eleven official South African languages were 
spoken. Each community typically spoke two or 
more languages. A Lwazi system that delivers 
information about SASSA services would be 
more accessible to the older, rural population 
than current print methods; the proposed system 
would support a majority of the eleven 
languages in order to offer a better information 
channel. 
4.4 Suitability of Technology  
The research prior to the design of the Lwazi 
system investigated how to ensure that the 
proposed system will be suitable to the lifestyle 
of the community to be served.  We do know 
that currently, communities have other means of 
accessing government information, including the 
free ?Vukuzenzele? monthly magazine and local 
radio stations.  Like these current means, Lwazi 
must be free in order to be effective and it must 
contain content that is locally-relevant to these 
peri-urban and rural communities. Government 
departments will find Lwazi to be a very useful 
and low-cost way of disseminating their 
information. Rural South Africans will benefit 
from the alternative source of critical 
information. 
4.5 User Expertise  
We also sought to evaluate the current expertise 
of potential Lwazi system users with telephony 
and other ICT technologies. The user expertise 
of telephony systems differ between young and 
old. As mentioned earlier, households have at 
least one cell phone.  The older members of the 
community use it to call and receive calls from 
friends and children in neighbouring urban areas. 
They do not know how to send text messages.  
Some children have saved the full ?Please call 
me? line as a quick dial so that their elder family 
members can just press it in cases of emergency.   
The young people on the other hand are well 
versed with telephony technology.  Most of them 
are also familiar with the basic use of a 
computer, despite their limited access to them. 
The Lwazi system must be as simple as making a 
phone call to a friend or relative in order to be 
accessible to all. In most households, however, 
there is someone who is technically competent. 
Based on our fieldwork and recent user studies of 
SDSs in developing regions, a Lwazi system 
could be useable in the rural context of South 
Africa, especially among the elderly and those 
who do not read and write. 
5. Discussion 
5.1 Potential Uptake 
We saw two main areas where a telephony 
service could be very useful. The first is in 
supporting communication between community 
and government. For example, a multilingual, 
automated service could direct calls from 
community members to the appropriate TSC 
office or CDW, or perhaps provide locally-
relevant information such as office hours of 
operation, directions to the office, and eligibility 
requirements for services. Such a service might 
reduce the amount of calls that a TSC office or 
CDW would need to take personally. It could 
also likely save a community member a trip if 
they were sure beforehand what paperwork they 
needed to bring and when the office was open. It 
is important to mention here that the project will 
require a buy-in from the local councillors of the 
communities we will be piloting in.  
The second area in which a telephony service 
could be useful would be in facilitating internal 
communication among government service 
providers. CDWs may need to meet community 
members face to face whenever possible. 
Coordinating with government staff across the 
municipality, district, province, or country could 
happen remotely and efficiently if government 
staff could use an automated telephony service to 
send audio messages to several staff members at 
once. The national coordinator for CDWs, for 
example, could notify every CDW in the country 
of upcoming events and policy changes with a 
single phone call.  
Many government officials, including 
Thusong centre managers, felt the system might 
assist them in communicating with the 
communities they serve.  There was, however, a 
concern from one site that there are sections of 
the population that do not have mobile 
63
 connection or a reliable source of electricity to 
charge their phones. These could be the 
communities that need government services the 
most.  In these cases, Lwazi will have to play a 
supportive role to the existing services provided 
by the CDWs, rather than allowing direct access 
by community members. 
 Our field work revealed the effectiveness of 
national government programs to connect rural 
citizens to available government services. Our 
major finding was that although particulars about 
the communities differed, individuals in the 
eleven communities visited experienced barriers 
to information access that could be mitigated 
with automated telephony services, provided that 
such services are toll free and localized to the 
language and information relevant to the 
particular rural community. Whereas 
infrastructure such as roads, services, and in 
some cases, electricity were limited, the mobile 
phone network of South Africa is reliable and 
widespread. We feel optimistic that the Lwazi 
system will build on the available infrastructure 
to transcend the barriers of geography and 
improve the connection between citizens and 
services. 
5.2 Challenges 
In a large and culturally diverse country such as 
South Africa, deploying a SDS intended to 
provide universal access is a great challenge. 
Designing for any given user group often 
requires a multiple iterations of testing and user 
feedback. Our fieldwork revealed a diverse set of 
end users; a successful design will require a 
greater investment in time and resource to gather 
detailed and accurate information about rural 
South Africans. Although we plan to rely on our 
partners (TSC and CDWs) on the ground for a 
great deal of this information, we believe it is an 
ambitious goal to expect deployment of the 
Lwazi project  in eleven languages country wide 
by summer 2009.    
Not only is the technological aspect very 
ambitious, this kind of national government 
sponsored system requires tactful management 
of stakeholders. The success of the Lwazi project  
relies on community members, government 
partners, researchers, NGO's, and corporate 
interests, all of whom have conflicting needs and 
interests. Our team recognizes the importance of 
managing stakeholder interests and has devised a 
problem structuring method to facilitate 
feedback and discussion (Plauch? et al, 
submitted).   
Community buy-in is critical to the success of 
an ICT deployment. We found not only that the 
TSC and CDW national coordinators but also 
each of the communities visited were all excited 
about the potential of the proposed system.  
Generally, rural communities are comfortable 
with the use of a mobile phone.  But there is an 
age difference in preference of different 
applications.  Because Lwazi is voice-based, the 
senior citizens of the community will be more 
likely to be excited about it than the younger 
generations.  Younger South Africans are 
comfortable with the cheaper, text interface to 
mobile phones. We recognise that Lwazi may not 
suit the needs of all South Africans, but we aim 
to make it accessible to those who are 
historically excluded.  In doing so, we hope to 
have an overall impact in this country where only 
26% of the population has a Matric or tertiary 
education (Stats SA, 2007).   
6. Conclusion 
In this paper we evaluated the potential role of 
Lwazi, a proposed telephone-based SDS, in 
improving rural access to important government 
services.  The Lwazi project will create an open 
platform for telephone-based services for 
government to provide information in all eleven 
languages.  Lwazi will be especially useful if it 
can reduce cost or the distances that people travel 
to access government services and that the 
distances that government workers travel to 
check in with municipal offices. Our team plans 
to conduct pilots in two communities in the 
summer of 2009.  A successful pilot in one of 
these communities will then burgeon into a 
national service for all South Africans to 
empower themselves through improved access to 
information, services and government resources.
