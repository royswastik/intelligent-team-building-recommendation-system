Abstract 
In this paper, we present a domain focused 
Tamil Named Entity Recognizer for 
tourism domain. This method takes care of 
morphological inflections of named entities 
(NE). It handles nested tagging of named 
entities with a hierarchical tagset 
containing 106 tags. The tagset is designed 
with focus to tourism domain. We have 
experimented building Conditional 
Random Field (CRF) models by training 
the noun phrases of the training data and it 
gives encouraging results. 
1 Introduction 
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the task of 
identifying and classifying the entities such as 
person names, place names, organization names 
etc, in a given document. Named entities play a 
major role in information extraction. NER has been 
a defined subtask in Message Understanding 
Conference (MUC) since MUC 6. A well 
performing NER is important for further level of 
NLP techniques. 
In general NER is a hard problem.. Words can 
have multiple uses and there is an unbounded 
number of possible names. Many techniques have 
been applied in Indian and European languages for 
NER. Some of them are rule based system (Krupka 
and Hausman, 1998), which makes use of 
dictionary and patterns of named entities, Decision 
trees (Karkaletsis et al, 2000), Hidden Morkov 
Model (HMM) (Biker, 1997), Maximum Entropy 
Morkov Model (MEMM) (Borthwick et al, 1998), 
Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Andrew 
McCallum and Wei Li, 2003) etc. In short, the 
approaches can be classified as rule-based 
approach, machine learning approach or hybrid 
approach. 
For Indian languages, many techniques have 
been tried by different people. MEMM system for 
Hindi NER (Kumar and Pushpak, 2006) gave an 
average F1 measure of 71.9 for a tagset of four 
named entity tags.  
NER has been done generically and also domain 
specific where a finer tagset is needed to describe 
the named entities in a domain. Domain specific 
NER is common and has been in existence for a 
long time in the Bio-domain (Settles 2004) for 
identification of protein names, gene names, DNA 
names etc.  
We have developed a domain specific 
hierarchical tagset consisting of 106 tags for 
tourism domain. We have used Conditional 
Random Fields, a machine learning approach to 
sequence labeling task, which includes NER. 
Section 2 gives a brief introduction to 
Conditional Random Fields (CRF). Section 3 
discusses the nature of named entities in Tamil, 
followed by section 4 describing the tagset used in 
tourism domain. Section 5 describes how we have 
presented the training data to build CRF models 
and how we have handled nested tagging. Sections 
6 and 7 explain the experiments and results. The 
paper is concluded in section 8.

2 Conditional Random Fields (CRF) 
Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al, 
2001) is a machine learning technique. CRF 
overcomes the difficulties faced in other machine 
learning techniques like Hidden Markov Model 
(HMM) (Rabiner, 1989) and Maximum Entropy 
Markov Model (MEMM) (Berger et al, 1996). 
HMM does not allow the words in the input 
sentence to show dependency among each other. 
MEMM shows a label bias problem because of its 
stochastic state transition nature. CRF overcomes 
these problems and performs better than the other 
two. HMM, MEMM and CRF are suited for 
sequence labeling task. But only MEMM and CRF 
allows linguistic rules or conditions to be 
incorporated into machine learning algorithm. 
Lafferty et al define Conditional Random Fieds 
as follows: ?Let G = (V,E) be a graph such that Y 
= (Y
v
)
v V
, so that Y is indexed by the vertices of 
G. Then (X,Y) is a conditional random field in 
case, when conditioned on X, the random variables 
Y
v 
obey the Markov property with respect to the 
graph: p(Y
v
|X,Y
w
,w?v) = p(Y
v
|X,Y
w
,w~v), where 
w~v means that w and v are neighbors in G?.  
Here X denotes a sentence and Y denotes the 
label sequence. The label sequence y which 
maximizes the likelihood probability p
?
(y|x) will 
be considered as the correct sequence, while 
testing for new sentence x with CRF model ? . The 
likelihood probability p
?
(y|x) is expressed as 
follows.  
  
where ?
k 
and ?
k 
are parameters from CRF model ? 
and f
k 
and g
k 
are the binary feature functions that 
we need to give for training the CRF model. This 
is how we integrate linguistic features into 
machine learning models like CRF.  
In NER task, the sequence of words which 
forms a sentence or a phrase can be considered as 
the sequence x and the sequence formed by named 
entity label for each word in the sequence x is the 
label sequence y. Now, the task of finding y that 
best describes x can be found by maximizing the 
likelihood probability p
?
(y|x). Thus, NER task can 
be considered as a sequence labeling task. Hence 
CRF can be used for NER task. 
3 Characteristics of Named Entities in 
Tamil 
Unlike English, there is no concept of capital 
letters in Tamil and hence no capitalization 
information is available for named entities in 
Tamil. All named entities are nouns and hence are 
Noun Phrases. But not all Noun Phrases are 
Named Entities. Since named entities are noun 
phrases, they take all morphological inflections. 
This makes a single named entity to appear as 
different words in different places. By applying 
Morphological analysis on words, the root words 
of inflected Named Entities can be obtained. These 
roots will be uninflected Named Entities which is 
what is required in most applications. Some type of 
named entities like date, money etc, occur in 
specific patterns. 
Example for inflected named entity:  
  ceVnYnYEkku (?to Chennai?).  
Example for pattern in named entity:  
2006 aktopar 25Am wewi (?25
th 
October, 
2006?) 
Pattern: <4 digits> <month> <1-2 digit> [Am   
wewi] 
4 Named Entity Tagset used 
The tagset which we use here for NER contains 
106 tags related to each other hierarchically. This 
type of tagset is motivated from ?ACE English 
Annotation Guidelines for Entities? developed by 
Linguistic Data Consortium. The tagset which we 
use is built in-house with focus to tourism domain.  
4.1 Sample Tags 
Sample tags from the entire tagset is shown below 
with their hierarchy.  
1. Enamex 
1.1. Person 
1.1.1. Individual 
1.1.1.1. Family Name 
1.1.1.2. Title 
60
1.1.2. Group 
1.2. Organization 
. . . . 
1.3. Location 
. . . . 
1.4. Facilities 
. . . . 
1.5. Locomotive 
. . . . 
1.6. Artifact 
. . . . 
1.7. Entertainment 
. . . . 
1.8. Materials 
. . . . 
1.9. Livthings 
. . . . 
1.10. Plants

1.11. Disease 
. . . . 
2. Numex 
2.1. Distance 
2.2. Money 
2.3. Quantity 
2.4. Count 
3. Timex 
3.1. Time 
3.2. Year 
3.3. Month 
3.4. Date 
3.5. Day 
3.6. Period 
3.7. Sday  
Certain tags in this tagset are designed with 
focus to Tourism and Health Tourism domain, 
such as place, address, water bodies (rivers, lakes 
etc.,), religious places, museums, parks, 
monuments, airport, railway station, bus station, 
events, treatments for diseases, distance and date. 
The tags are assigned with numbers 1,2,3 for 
zero
th 
level, the tags with numbers 1.1, 1.11, 2.1 
,2.4 and 3.1 ,3.7 etc for level-1, the tags with 
numbers 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.2.1 etc as level-2  and the 
tags with numbers 1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.2, 1.2.4.1 etc for 
level-3  because they occur in the hierarchy in 
corresponding levels. We have 3 tags in zero
th
  
level, 22 tags in level-1, 50 tags in level-2 and 31 
tags in level-3. 
4.2 Sample Annotation 
Tamil : 
<person> <city> mawurE </city> <individual> 
manYi <familyname> Eyar </familyname> 
</individual> </person> <city> ceVnYnYEkku 
</city> vanwAr. 
English equivalent : 
<person> <city> Madhurai </city> <individual> 
Mani <familyname> Iyer </familyname> 
</individual> </person> came to <city> Chennai 
</city>. 
5 NER using CRF 
We used CRF++ (Taku Kudo, 2005), an open 
source toolkit for linear chain CRF. This tool when 
presented with the attributes extracted from the 
training data builds a CRF model with the feature 
template specified by us. When presented with the 
model thus obtained and attributes extracted from 
the test data, CRF tool outputs the test data tagged 
with the labels that has been learnt. 
5.1 Presenting training data 
Training data will contain nested tagging of named 
entities as shown in section 4.2. To handle nested 
tagging and to avoid ambiguities, we isolate the 
tagset into three subsets, each of which will 
contain tags from one level in the hierarchy. Now, 
the training data itself will be presented to CRF as 
three sets of training data. From this, we will get 
three CRF models, one for each level of hierarchy. 
Example: 
The sample sentence given in section 4.2 will be 
presented to CRF training for each level of 
hierarchy as follows: 
Level-1: 
<location> mawurE </location> <person> 
manYi Eyar </person> <location> ceVnYnYEkku 
</location> vanwAr. 
Level-2: 
<place> mawurE </place> <individual> manYi 
Eyar </individual> <place> ceVnYnYEkku 
</place> vanwAr. 
Level-3: 
<city> mawurE </city> manYi <familyname> 
Eyar </familyname> <city> ceVnYnYEkku 
</city> vanwAr. 
Notice that the tags ?location? and ?place? are 
not specified in the input sentence. In the 
61
hierarchy, the ?location? tag is the parent tag of 
?place? tag which is a parent tag of ?city? tag. Thus 
for the word ?mawurE?, level-1 tag is ?location?, 
level-2 tag is ?place? and level-3 tag is ?city?. 
5.2 Attributes and Feature Templates 
Attributes are the dependencies from which the 
system can infer a phrase to be named entity or 
not. Features are the conditions imposed on these 
attributes. Feature templates help CRF engine to 
form features from the attributes of the training 
data. From the characteristics of named entities in 
Tamil, we see that it is only the noun phrases that 
are possible candidates for Named Entities. So we 
apply Noun Phrase Chunking and consider only 
noun phrases and train on them. The attributes that 
we arrived at are explained below: 
1. Roots of words: This is to ignore 
inflections in named entities. Also to learn 
the context in which the named entity 
occurs, we consider two words prior and 
two words subsequent to the word under 
analysis and take unigram, bigram and 
trigram combinations of them as attributes. 
2. Their Parts of Speech (POS): This will 
give whether a noun is proper noun or 
common noun. POS of current word is 
considered. 
3. Words and POS combined: The present 
word combined with the POS tag of the 
previous two words and the present word 
combined with POS of the next two words 
are taken as features. 
4. Dictionary of Named Entities: A list of 
named entities is collected for each type of 
named entities. Root words are checked 
against the dictionary and if present in the 
dictionary, the dictionary feature for the 
corresponding type of named entity is 
considered positive. 
5. Patterns: Certain types of named entities 
such as date, time, money etc., show 
patterns in their occurrences. These 
patterns are listed out. The current noun 
phrase is checked against each pattern. The 
feature is taken as true for those patterns 
which are satisfied by the current noun 
phrase. 
Example Patterns:  
Date: <4 digits> <month> <1-2 digit> [Am 
wewi] 
Money: rU. <digits> [Ayiram|latcam|koti] 
(English Equivalent: 
 Rs. <digits> [thousands|lakhs|crores]) 
6. Bigram of Named Entity label 
A feature considering the bigram occurrences of 
the named entity labels in the corpus is considered. 
This is the feature that binds the consecutive 
named entity labels of a sequence and thus forming 
linear chain CRFs. Sample noun phrase with level-
1 tags:  
arulYmiku JJ  person 
cupramaNiya NNPC    person 
cuvAmi  NNPC    person 
wirukoyil   NNC location 
vayalUr NNP location  
English Equivalent:  
Gracious JJ person 
Subramaniya NNPC person 
Swami NNPC person 
Temple NNC location 
Vayalore NNP location  
Attributes are extracted for each token in the 
noun phrase. For example, the attributes for third 
token in the sample noun phrase given are as 
follows. 
1. Unigram: arulYmiku, cupramaNiya, 
cuvAmi, wirukoyil, vayalUr. 
2. Bigram: cupramaNiya/cuvAmi, cuvAmi/ 
wirukoyil 
3. Trigram: cupramaNiya/cuvAmi/wirukoyil 
4. POS of current word: NNPC 
5. Word and previous 2 POS:  JJ/NNPC/ 
cuvAmi 
6. Word and next 2 POS: cuvAmi/NNC/NNP 
7. Bigram of NE labels: person/person 
62
The CRF training process described above is 
illustrated in Figure-1.   
5.3 Presenting testing data 
Test data will also be presented in way similar to 
how we presented the training data. Test data is 
processed for Morph analysis, POS (Arulmozhi et 
al., 2004) and NP chunking (Sobha and Vijay 
Sundar Ram, 2006). Here also, the same set of 
attributes and feature templates are used. Now, the 
test data is tagged with each of the CRF models 
built for three levels of hierarchy. All the three 
outputs are merged to get a combined output. The 
CRF testing is illustrated in Figure 2. 
6 Experiments 
A 94k words corpus is collected in Tamil for 
tourism domain. Morph Analysis, POS tagging, 
NP chunking and named entity annotation are done 
manually on the corpus. This corpus contains about 
20k named entities. This corpus is split into two 
sets. One forms the training data and the other 
forms the test data. They consist of 80% and 20% 
of the total data respectively. CRF is trained with 
training data and CRF models for each of the 
levels in the hierarchy are obtained. With these 
models the test data is tagged and the output is 
evaluated manually.  
7 Results 
The results of the above experiment are as follows. 
Here, NE means Named Entity, NP means noun 
phrase.  
Number of NPs in test data = 7922 
There are totally 4059 NEs in the test data. All 
of them bear level-1 tags. Out of 4059 NEs, 3237 
NEs bear level-2 tags and 727 NEs bear level-3 
tags. The result from the system is shown in Table 
1 and Table 2. 
The system performs well for domain focused 
corpus. It identifies inflected named entities 
efficiently by considering the root form of each 
word in noun phrases. The reason for good

precision is that tagging is done only when the root 
word that it is seeing is already learnt from the 
training corpus or the context of the current word 
is similar to the context of the named entities that it 
has learnt from the training corpus. However, in 
some words like ?arccunYAnawi? (Arjuna River), 
the Morph Analyzer gives two root words which 
are ?arccunYa? and ?nawi?. For our case, only the 
first word is considered and the system tags it as 
?person? instead of ?waterbodies?.

When there are new named entities which are 
not in training corpus, CRF tries to capture the 
context and tags accordingly. In such cases 
irrelevant context that it may learn while training 
will cause problem resulting in wrong tagging. 
This affects the precision to some extent. When the 
named entities and their context are new to CRF, 
then they are most likely not tagged. This affects 
the recall. 
From Table 1, we see that the system performs 
better for level-2 tags than for level-1 tags even 
though level-1 tags are less in number than level-2 
tags and occur more frequently than level-2 tags. 
This is so because the named entities with level-2 
tags have relatively more context and are lesser in 
length (number of words in the named entity) than 
the named entities in level-1 tags. Level-3 tags 
contain lesser number of tags than level-2 tags and 
also occur less frequently. Because of relatively 
more data sparseness, the system is unable to 
perform well for level-3 tags as it can for other 
levels. 
8 Conclusion 
We see that Conditional Random Fields is well 
suited for Named Entity recognition task in Indian 
languages also, where the inflection of named 
entities can be handled by considering their root 
forms. A good precision can be obtained by 
presenting only the noun phrases for both testing 
and training.
