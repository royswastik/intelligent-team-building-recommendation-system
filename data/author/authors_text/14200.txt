Abstract 
We propose an effective approach to auto-
matically identify predicate heads in Chinese 
sentences based on statistical pre-processing 
and rule-based post-processing. In the pre-
processing stage, the maximal noun phrases in 
a sentence are recognized and replaced by 
?NP? labels to simplify the sentence structure. 
Then a CRF model is trained to recognize the 
predicate heads of this simplified sentence. In 
the post-processing stage, a rule base is built 
according to the grammatical features of 
predicate heads. It is then utilized to correct 
the preliminary recognition results. Experi-
mental results show that our approach is feasi-
ble and effective, and its accuracy achieves 
89.14% on Tsinghua Chinese Treebank. 
1 Introduction 
It is an important issue to identify predicates in 
syntactic analysis. In general, a predicate is con-
sidered the head of a sentence. In Chinese, it 
usually organizes two parts into a well-formed 
sentence, one with a subject and its adjunct, and 
the other with an object and/or complement (Luo 
et al, 1994). Accurate identification of predicate 
head is thus critical in determining the syntactic 
structure of a sentence. Moreover, a predicate 
head splitting a long sentence into two shorter 
parts can alleviate the complexity of syntactic 
analysis to a certain degree. This is particularly 
useful when long dependency relations are in-
volved. Without doubt, this is also a difficult task 
in Chinese dependency parsing (Cheng et al, 
2005). 
Predicate head identification also plays an im-
portant role in facilitating various tasks of natural 
language processing. For example, it enhances 
shallow parsing (Sun et al, 2000) and head-
driven parsing (Collins, 1999), and also improves 
the precision of sentence similarity computation 
(Sui et al, 1998a). There is reason to expect it to 
be more widely applicable to other tasks, e.g. 
machine translation, information extraction, and 
question answering. 
In this paper, we propose an effective ap-
proach to automatically recognize predicate 
heads of Chinese sentences based on a preproc-
essing step for maximal noun phrases 1(MNPs). 
MNPs usually appear in the location of subject 
and object in a sentence. The proper identifica-
tion of them is thus expected to assist the analy-
sis of sentence structure and/or improve the ac-
curacy of predicate head recognition. 
In the next section, we will first review some 
related works and discuss their limitations, fol-
lowed by a detailed description of the task of 
recognizing predicate heads in Section 3. Section 
4 illustrates our proposed approach and Section 5 
presents experiments and results. Finally we 
conclude the paper in Section 6. 
2 Related Works 
There exist various approaches to identify predi-
cate heads in Chinese sentences. Luo and Zheng 
(1994) and Tan (2000) presented two rule-based 
methods based on contextual features and part of 
speeches. A statistical approach was presented in 
Sui and Yu (1998b), which utilizes a decision 
tree model. Gong et al (2003) presented their 
hybrid method combining both rules and statis-
tics. These traditional approaches only make use 
of the static and dynamic grammatical features of 
the quasi-predicates to identify the predicate 
heads. On this basis, Li and Meng (2005) pro-
posed a method to further utilize syntactic rela-
tions between the subject and the predicate in a 
sentence. Besides the above monolingual pro-
posals, Sui and Yu (1998a) discussed a bilingual 
strategy to recognize predicate heads in Chinese 
                                                 
1 Maximal noun phrase is the noun phrase which is not con-
tained by any other noun phrases.  
sentences with reference to those in their coun-
terpart English sentences. 
Nevertheless, these methods have their own 
limitations. The rule-based methods require ef-
fective linguistic rules to be formulated by lin-
guists according to their own experience. Cer-
tainly, this is impossible to cover all linguistic 
situations concerned, due to the complexity of 
language and the limitations of human observa-
tion. In practice, we also should not underesti-
mate the complexity of feature application, the 
computing power demanded and the difficulties 
in handing irregular sentence patterns. For in-
stance, a sentence without subject may lead to an 
incorrect recognition of predicate head. For cor-
pus-based approaches, they rely on language data 
in huge size but the available data may not be 
adequate. Those bilingual methods may first en-
counter the difficulty of determining correct sen-
tence alignment in the case that the parallel data 
consist of much free translation. 
Our method proposed here focuses on a simple 
but effective means to help identify predicate 
heads, i.e., MNP pre-processing. At present, 
there has some substantial progress in automatic 
recognition of MNP. Zhou et al (2000) proposed 
an efficient algorithm for identifying Chinese 
MNPs by using their structure combination, 
achieving an 85% precision and an 82% recall. 
Dai et al (2008) presented another method based 
on statistics and rules, reaching a 90% F-score on 
HIT Chinese Treebank. Jian et al (2009) em-
ployed both left-right and right-left sequential 
labeling and developed a novel ?fork position? 
based probabilistic algorithm to fuse bidirec-
tional results, obtaining an 86% F-score on the 
Penn Chinese Treebank. Based on these previous 
works, we have developed an approach that first 
identifies the MNPs in a sentence, which are then 
used in determining the predicate heads in the 
next stage. 
3 Task  Description 
The challenge of accurate identification of predi-
cate heads is to resolve the problem of quasi-
predicate heads in a sentence. On the one hand, 
the typical POSs of predicate heads in Chinese 
sentences are verbs, adjectives and descriptive 
words 2 . Each of them may have multiple in-
stances in a sentence. On the other hand, while a 
simple sentence has only one predicate head, a 
complex sentence may have multiple ones. The 
                                                 
2 We only focus on Verbs and adjectives in this work. 
latter constitutes 8.25% in our corpus. Thus, the 
real difficulty lies in how to recognize the true 
predicate head of a sentence among so many 
possibilities. 
Take a simple sentence as example: 
?/rN ?/qN ?/v ??/a ??/n ?
/uJDE ?/a ?/n ??/v ??/aD ?
/uJDE ??/v ?/n ?/cC ??/v ?
/n ?/wE 
The quasi-predicate heads (verbs and adjectives) 
include ?/v, ??/a, ?/a, ??/v, ??/v, 
and ??/v. However, there are two MNPs in 
this sentence, namely, ??/rN ?/qN ?/v ??
/a ??/n ?/uJDE ?/a ?/n? and ???/aD 
?/uJDE ??/v ?/n ?/cC ??/v ?/n?. 
These two MNPs cover most quasi-predicate 
heads in the sentence, except ??/v, the true 
predicate head that we want. 
An MNP is a complete semantic unit, and its 
internal structure may include different kinds of 
constituents (Jian et al, 2009). Therefore, the 
fundamental structure of a sentence can be made 
clear after recognizing its MNPs. This can help 
filter out those wrong quasi-predicates for a bet-
ter shortlist of good candidates for the true predi-
cate head in a sentence. 
In practice, the identification of predicate head 
begins with recognizing MNPs in the same sen-
tence. It turns the above example sentence into: 
[ ?/rN ?/qN ?/v ??/a ??/n ?
/uJDE ?/a ?/n ] ??/v [ ??/aD 
?/uJDE ??/v ?/n ?/cC ??/v ?
/n ] ?/wE 
These MNPs are then replaced with the conven-
tional label ?NP? for noun phrase, resulting in a 
simplified sentence structure as follows. 
NP/NP  ??/v  NP/NP ?/wE 
This basic sentence structure can largely allevi-
ates the complexity of the original sentence and 
narrows down the selection scope of quasi-
predicates for the true head. In this particular 
example, the only verb left in the sentence after 
MNP recognition is the true predicate head. 
4 Predicate Head Identification  
This section describes the process of identifying 
predicate heads in sentences. As illustrated in 
Figure 1 below, it can be divided into three steps: 
Step 1: recognize the MNPs in a sentence and 
replace the MNPs with ?NP? label to simplify 
the sentence structure. 
Step 2: recognize the predicate heads in the 
resulted simplified structure. 
Step 3: post-process the preliminary results to 
correct the wrong predicate heads according to 
heuristics in a rule base. 
4.1 MNP Recognition 
The MNP recognition is performed via a trained 
CRF model on unlabeled data. We adopt the 
method in Dai et al (2008), with modified tem-
plates for the different corpus. Each feature is 
composed of the words and POS tags surround-
ing the current word i, as well as different com-
bination of them. The context window of tem-
plate is set to size 3. Table 1 shows the feature 
template we use.

Figure 1: Flow Chart of Predicate Head Identification 
 
The main effective factors for MNPs recogni-
tion are the lengths of MNPs and the complexity 
of sentence in question. We analyze the length 
distribution of MNPs in TCT 3  corpus, finding 
that their average length is 6.24 words and the 
longest length is 119 words. Table 2 presents this 
distribution in detail. 
 
Length of MNP Occurrences Percentage (%)

5?len?10 2348 35.17 
len?10 1069 16.01 
 
Table 2: Length Distribution of MNPs in TCT Corpus 
 
The MNPs longer than 5 words cover 50% of 
total occurrences, indicating the relatively high 
complexity of sentences. We trained a CRF 
model using this data set, which achieves an F-
score of 83.7% on MNP recognition. 
4.2 Predicate Head Identification 
After the MNPs in a sentence are recognized, 
they are replaced by ?NP? label to rebuild a sim-
plified sentence structure. It largely reduces the 
difficulty in identifying predicate heads from this 
simplified structure.  
We evaluate our models by their precision in 
the test set, which is formulated as

The right_sentences refer to the number of sen-
tences whose predicate heads are successfully 
identified, and the sum_sentences to the total 
number of sentences in the test set. We count a 
sentence as right_sentence if and only if all its 
predicate heads are successfully identified, in-
cluding those with multiple predicate heads. 
For each predicate head, we need an appropri-
ate feature representation f (i, j). We test the 
model performance with different context win-
dow sizes of template. The results are shown in 
Table 3 as follows.

Temp1 2 79.27 
Temp2 3 82.59 
Temp3 4 81.37 
 
Table 3: Precisions of Predicate Heads Recognition under 
Different Context Window Sizes 
 
It shows that the window size of 3 words gives 
the highest precision (82.59%). Therefore we 
apply this window size, together with other fea-
tures in our CRF model, including words, POSs, 
phrase tags and their combinations. There are 24 
template types in total. 
4.3 Post-processing 
The post-processing stage is intended to correct 
errors in the preliminary identification results of 
MNP recognition MNP replacement Predicate head recognition y results 
Predicate head recognition model Rule base MNP recognition model 
predicate heads, by applying linguistic rules for-
mulated heuristically. We test each rule to see if 
it improves the recognition accuracy, so as to 
retrieve a validated rule base. The labeling of 
predicate heads follows the standard of TCT and 
a wrong labeling is treated as an error. 
There are three main types of error, according 
to our observation. The first is that no predicate 
head is identified. The second is that the whole 
sentence is recognized as an MNP, such that no 
predicate head is recognized. The third is that the 
predicate head is incorrectly identified, such as  
??? in the expression ???????, where the 
correct answer is ???? according to the TCT 
standard.  
 
Error types Percentage Improved  percentage 
No predicate head 17.50% 2.44% 
a sentence as an MNP 10.63% 1.11% 
??????? 8.75% 0.56% 
Others 63.12% 2.77% 
 
Table 4: Types of Error  
 
Table 4 lists different types of error, together 
with their percentage in all sentences whose 
predicate heads have been mistakenly identified, 
and the improvement in percentage after the 
post-processing. To correct these errors, a num-
ber of rules for post-processing are formulated. 
The main rules are the followings: 
? If no predicate head is recognized in a sen-
tence, we label the first verb as the predi-
cate head. 
Error sample??/p [ ????/m ?/qT ?
???/nR ] ?/f ?/wP [ ??/nS ??/d 
??/v ????/b ???/b ??/n ] ?

? If the whole sentence is recognized as an 
MNP, such that no predicate head is identi-
fied, we label the first verb as the predicate 
head.

??/v ???/n ?/vC [ ?/d ?/v ??
??/n ?/cC ????/n ??/n ?/uJDE 
???/b ??/n ] ?/wE 
There are also other rules in the rule base be-
sides the above ones. For example, if the first 
word of a sentences is ??? or ????, it is la-
beled as the predicate head. 
5 Experiments 
5.1 Data Sets 
Our experiments are carried out on the Tsinghua 
Chinese Treebank (TCT). Every constituent of a 
sentence in TCT is labeled by human expert. We 
randomly extract 5000 sentences from TCT and 
remove those sentences that do not have predi-
cate head. Finally, our data set contains 4613 
sentences, in which 3711 sentences are randomly 
chosen as training data and 902 sentences as test-
ing data. The average length of these sentences 
in training set is 20 words. 
The number of quasi-predicate heads in a sen-
tence is a critical factor to determine the per-
formance of predicate head recognition. Reduc-
ing the number of quasi-predicate heads can im-
prove the recognition precision. Table 5 shows 
the percentage of quasi-predicate heads in train-
ing data before and after MNP replacement.

quasi-
predicates

ment(%) 
Percentage after

ment(%)

2 19.62 27.22 
3 20.37 12.37 
>3 47.51 10.72 
 
Table 5: The Percentage of Quasi-predicate Heads Before 
and After MNP Replacement 
 
From Table 5, we can see that almost half sen-
tences contain more than three quasi-predicate 
heads. Only 12.5% of sentences have only one 
quasi-predicate head before MNP replacement. 
However, after MNPs are replaced with the ?NP? 
label, only 10.72% contain more than three 
quasi-predicate heads and nearly 50% contain 
only one quasi-predicate head. We have evidence 
that MNP pre-processing can reduce the number 
of quasi-predicate heads and lower the complex-
ity of sentence structures. 
5.2 Results and Discussion 
For comparison purpose, we developed four dif-
ferent models for predicate head recognition. 
Models 1 and 2 are CRF models, the former rec-
ognizing predicate heads directly and the later 
recognizing MNPs at the same time. Model 3 
recognizes predicate heads based on MNP pre-
processing. Model 4 is based on model 3, includ-
ing the post-processing stage. Table 6 shows the 
recognition performance of each model using the 
best context window size. 
 
Model Context window size 
Number of cor-
rect sentences 
Preci-
sion(%) 
model 1 4 680 75.39 
model 2 4 687 76.16 
model 3 3 745 82.59 
model 4 3 804 89.14 
 
Table 6: Performance of Different Models 
 
Comparing these models, we can see that the 
additional feature in model 2 leads to 1% im-
provement in precision over model 1. Moreover, 
the MNP pre-processing in model 3 results in a 
large increase in accuracy, compared to model 1. 
It indicates that the MNP pre-processing does 
improve the precision of recognition. Compared 
with model 3, model 4 achieves a precision even 
6.55% higher, indicating that the post-processing 
is also an effective step for recognition. 
As shown, the performance is affected by the 
effect of MNP recognition. There are three kinds 
of relation between the predicate heads and the 
types of MNP recognition error: 
Relation 1: The whole sentence is recognized 
as an MNP. 
Relation 2: The boundaries of an MNP are in-
correctly recognized and the MNP does not con-
tain the predicate head. 
Relation 3: The boundaries of an MNP are in-
correctly recognized and the MNP contains the 
predicate head. Table 7 shows the distribution of 
these three relations in the recognition errors. 
 
Relation Number of sentences Percentage(%)
Relation 1 17 5.47 
Relation 2  281 90.35 
Relation 3 13 4.18 
 
Table 7: Distribution of the Three Relations in 
Recognition Errors 
In our approach, the errors of relation 1 and 
relation 3 can be solved by the post-processing, 
as presented in Section 4.3. Relation 2 holds the 
largest proportion among the three. But the error 
rate of predicate head recognition only reaches 
31.67% in this case. That is to say, although the 
MNP boundaries are incorrectly recognized, the 
accuracy of predicate head recognition can still 
reach 68.33%. 
Chen (2007) proposed a probabilistic model 
(model 5) for recognizing predicate heads in Chi-
nese sentences. The probabilities of quasi-
predicates are estimated by maximum likelihood 
estimation. A discounted model is used to 
smooth parameters. We compare his model with 
our model 3 using different contextual features 
on TCT corpus. Table 8 shows the comparison 
results.  
The highest precision of model 3 is 82.59% 
when the context window size is set to 3. For 
model 5, it is 70.62% at a context window size of 
4. Experimental results show that the precision of 
our method is about 12% higher than Chen?s.

model 3 82.59 
model 5 70.62

Table 8: Comparison between model 3 and Chen?s model 
 
Beside Chen?s method, the Stanford Parser 
can also recognize the predicate heads in simple 
Chinese sentences. The root node of dependency 
tree is the predicate head. For a comparison, we 
randomly extract two hundred simple sentences 
in our test data to compare it with the outputs of 
our model 3. We also train a model of predicate 
head recognition (model 6), which assumes that 
all MNPs are successfully identified. The com-
parison is shown in Table 9. We can see that the 
precision of model 6 is 8.35% higher than model 
3. This means that our method still has a certain 
room for further improvement.

5.3 Error Analysis 
As shown above, the post-processing can correct 
most errors in the recognition of predicate heads. 
But we also observe some errors that cannot be 
corrected this way. For example, 
???/n?/p ???/n ??/v [ ??/n 
??/n ] ??/v ?/wE 
The predicate head here is ????, but usually 
???? is recognized as the predicate head. This 
is because ???? can be used either as a verb or 
a noun. There are many verbs of this kind in Chi-
nese, such as ??? ? and ??? ?. Mistakes 
caused by the flexibility of Chinese verb and the 
ambiguity of sentence structure appear to deserve 
more of our effort. Meanwhile, there are also 
some other unusual cases that cannot be properly 
solved with statistical methods. 
6 Conclusion 
Identification of predicate heads is important to 
syntactic parsing. In this paper, we have pre-
sented a novel method that combines both statis-
tical and rule-based approaches to identify predi-
cate heads based on MNP pre-processing and 
rule-based post-processing. We have had a series 
of experiments to show that this method achieves 
a significant improvement over some state-of-
the-art approaches. Furthermore, it also provides 
a simple structure of sentence that can be utilized 
for parsing. 
In the future, we will study how semantic in-
formation can be applied to further improve the 
precision of MNP recognition and predicate head 
identification. It is also very interesting to ex-
plore how this approach can facilitate parsing, 
including shallow parsing.
