Abstract
We present a novel method to detect parallel
fragments within noisy parallel corpora. Isolat-
ing these parallel fragments from the noisy data
in which they are contained frees us from noisy
alignments and stray links that can severely
constrain translation-rule extraction. We do
this with existing machinery, making use of an
existing word alignment model for this task.
We evaluate the quality and utility of the ex-
tracted data on large-scale Chinese-English and
Arabic-English translation tasks and show sig-
nificant improvements over a state-of-the-art
baseline.
1 Introduction
A decade ago, Banko and Brill (2001) showed that
scaling to very large corpora is game-changing for a
variety of tasks. Methods that work well in a small-
data setting often lose their luster when moving to
large data. Conversely, other methods that seem to
perform poorly in that same small-data setting, may
perform markedly differently when trained on large
data.
Perhaps most importantly, Banko and Brill
showed that there was no significant variation in per-
formance among a variety of methods trained at-
scale with large training data. The takeaway? If you
desire to scale to large datasets, use a simple solution
for your task, and throw in as much data as possible.
The community at large has taken this message to
heart, and in most cases it has been an effective way
to increase performance.
Today, for machine translation, more data than
what we already have is getting harder and harder
to come by; we require large parallel corpora to
Figure 1: Example of a word alignment resulting from
noisy parallel data. The structure of the resulting align-
ment makes it difficult to find and extract parallel frag-
ments via the standard heuristics or simply by inspection.
How can we discover automatically those parallel frag-
ments hidden within such data?
train state-of-the-art statistical, data-driven models.
Groups that depend on clearinghouses like LDC for
their data increasingly find that there is less of a man-
date to gather parallel corpora on the scale of what
was produced in the last 5-10 years. Others, who di-
rectly exploit the entire web to gather such data will
necessarily run up against a wall after all that data
has been collected.
We need to learn how to do more with the data
we already have. Previous work has focused on
detecting parallel documents and sentences on the
web, e.g. (Zhao and Vogel, 2002; Fung and Che-
ung, 2004; Wu and Fung, 2005). Munteanu and
Marcu (2006), and later Quirk et al (2007), extend
the state-of-the-art for this task to parallel fragments.
In this paper, we present a novel method for de-
tecting parallel fragments in large, existing and po-
tentially noisy parallel corpora using existing ma-
538
chinery and show significant improvements to two
state-of-the-art MT systems. We also depart from
previous work in that we only consider parallel cor-
pora that have previously been cleaned, sanitized,
and thought to be non-noisy, e.g. parallel corpora
available from LDC.
2 Detecting Noisy Data
In order to extract previously unextractable good
parallel data, we must first detect the bad data. In
doing so, we will make use of existing machinery in
a novel way. We directly use the alignment model to
detect weak or undesirable data for translation.
2.1 Alignment Model as Noisy Data Detector
The alignment model we use in our experiments is
that described in (Riesa et al, 2011), modified to
output full derivation trees and model scores along
with alignments. Our reasons for using this particu-
lar alignment method are twofold: it provides a natu-
ral way to hierarchically partition subsentential seg-
ments, and is also empirically quite accurate in mod-
eling word alignments, in general. This latter quality
is important, not solely for downstream translation
quality, but also for the basis of our claims with re-
spect to detecting noisy or unsuitable data:
The alignment model we employ is discrimina-
tively trained to know what good alignments be-
tween parallel data look like. When this model pre-
dicts an alignment with a low model score, given an
input sentence pair, we might say the model is ?con-
fused.? In this case, the alignment probably doesn?t
look like the examples it has been trained on.
1. It could be that the data is parallel, but the model
is very confused. (modeling problem)
2. It could be that the data is noisy, and the model
is very confused. (data problem)
The general accuracy of the alignment model we
employ makes the former case unlikely. Therefore,
a key assumption we make is to assume a low model
score accompanies noisy data, and use this data as
candidates from which to extract non-noisy parallel
segments.
2.2 A Brief Example
As an illustrative example, consider the follow-
ing sentence pair in our training corpus taken from
LDC2005T10. This is the sentence pair shown in
Figure 1:
fate brought us together on that wonderful summer day
and one year later , shou ? tao and i were married not only
in the united states but also in taiwan .
? ?? ? ?? , ? ? ? ???? ? ??? ? ? ???
; ? ?? ? ?? ? ? ? ? , ? ? ? ?? ? ? ?? .
In this sentence pair there are only two parallel
phrases, corresponding to the underlined and double-
underlined strings. There are a few scattered word
pairs which may have a natural correspondence,1 but
no other larger phrases.2
In this work we are concerned with finding large
phrases,3 since very small phrases tend to be ex-
tractible even when data is noisy. Bad alignments
tend to cause conflicts when extracting large phrases
due to unexpected, stray links in the alignment ma-
trix; smaller fragments will have less opportunity to
come into conflict with incorrect, stray links due to
noisy data or alignment model error. We consider
large enough phrases for our purposes to be phrases
of size greater than 3, and ignore smaller fragments.
2.3 Parallel Fragment Extraction
2.3.1 A Hierarchical Alignment Model and its
Derivation Trees
The alignment model we use, (Riesa et al,
2011), is a discriminatively trained model which at
alignment-time walks up the English parse-tree and,
at every node in the tree, generates alignments by re-
cursively scoring and combining alignments gener-
ated at the current node?s children, building up larger
and larger alignments. This process works similarly
to a CKY parser, moving bottom-up and generating
larger and larger constituents until it has predicted
the full tree spanning the entire sentence. How-
1For example, (I, ?) and (Taiwan, ??)
2The rest of the Chinese describes where the couple is from;
the speaker, she says, is an American raised in New Jersey.
3We count the size of the phrase according to the number of
English words it contains; one could be more conservative by
constraining both sides.

ter PP fragment, the alignment model objects due to non-

extract and append to our training corpus the NP fragment
depicted, from which we later learn 5 additional transla-
tion rules.
ever, instead of generating syntactic structures, we
are generating alignments.
In moving bottom-up along the tree, just as there
is a derivation tree for a CKY parse, we can also fol-
low backpointers to extract the derivation tree of the
1-best alignment starting from the root node. This
derivation tree gives a hierarchical partitioning of the
alignment and the associated word-spans. We can
also inspect model scores at each node in the deriva-
tion tree.
2.3.2 Using the Alignment Model to Detect
Parallel Fragments
For each training example in our parallel cor-
pus, we have an alignment derivation tree. Be-
cause the derivation tree is essentially isomorphic
to the English parse tree, the derivation tree repre-
sents a hierarchical partitioning of the training ex-
ample into syntactic segments. We traverse the tree
top-down, inspecting the parallel fragments implied
by the derivation at each point, and their associated
model scores.
The idea behind this top-down traversal is that al-
though some nodes, and perhaps entire derivations,
may be low-scoring, there are often high-scoring
fragments that make up the larger derivation which
are worthy of extraction. Figure 2 shows an ex-
ample. We recursively traverse the derivation, top-
down, extracting the largest fragment possible at
any derivation node whose alignment model score is
higher than some threshold ?, and whose associated
English and foreign spans meet a set of important
constraints:
1. The parent node in the derivation has a score less
than ?.
2. The length of the English span is > 3.
3. There are no unaligned foreign words inside the
fragment that are also aligned to English words
outside the fragment.
Once a fragment has been extracted, we do not re-
curse any further down the subtree.
Constraint 1 is a candidate constraint, and forces
us to focus on segments of parallel sentences with
low model scores; these are segments likely to con-
sist of bad alignments due to noisy data or aligner
error.
Constraint 2 is a conservativity constraint ? we
are more confident in model scores over larger frag-
ments with more context than smaller ones with min-
imal context. This constraint also parameterizes the
notion that larger fragments are the type more often
precluded from extraction due to stray or incorrect
word-alignment links; additionally, we are already
likely to be able to extract smaller fragments using
standard methods, and as such, they are less useful
to us here.
Constraint 3 is a content constraint, limiting us
from extracting fragments with blocks of unaligned
foreign words that don?t belong in this particular
fragment because they are aligned elsewhere. If we
threw out this constraint, then in translating from
Chinese to English, we would erroneously learn to
delete blocks of Chinese words that otherwise should
be translated. When foreign words are unaligned ev-
erywhere within a parallel sentence, then they can
be included within the extracted fragment. Common
examples in Chinese are function words such as ?,
?, and ?. Put another way, we only allow globally
unaligned words in extracted fragments.
Computing ?. In computing our extraction thresh-
old ?, we must decide what proportion of fragments
we consider to be low-scoring and least likely to be
useful for translation. We make the rather strong as-
540
sumption that this is the bottom 10% of the data.4
3 Evaluation
We evaluate our parallel fragment extraction in a
large-scale Chinese-English and Arabic-English MT
setting. In our experiments we use a tree-to-string
syntax-based MT system (Galley et al, 2004), and
evaluate on a standard test set, NIST08. We parse the
English side of our parallel corpus with the Berkeley
parser (Petrov et al, 2006), and tune parameters of
theMT systemwithMIRA (Chiang et al, 2008). We
decode with an integrated language model trained on
about 4 billion words of English.
Chinese-English We align a parallel corpus of
8.4M parallel segments, with 210M words of En-
glish and 193M words of Chinese. From this we
extract 868,870 parallel fragments according to the
process described in Section 2, and append these
fragments to the end of the parallel corpus. In doing
so, we have created a larger parallel corpus of 9.2M
parallel segments, consisting of 217M and 198M
words of English and Chinese, respectively.
Arabic-English We align a parallel corpus of
9.0M parallel segments, with 223M words of En-
glish and 194M words of Arabic. From this we ex-
tract 996,538 parallel fragments, and append these
fragments to the end of the parallel corpus. The re-
sulting corpus has 10M parallel segments, consisting
of 233M and 202Mwords of English and Arabic, re-
spectively.
Results are shown in Table 1. Using our parallel
fragment extraction, we learn 68M additional unique
Arabic-English rules that are not in the baseline sys-
tem; likewise, we learn 38M new unique Chinese-
English rules not in the baseline system for that lan-
guage pair. Note that we are not simply duplicat-
ing portions of the parallel data. While each se-
quence fragment of source and target words we ex-
tract will be found elsewhere in the larger parallel
corpus, these fragments will largely not make it into
fruitful translation rules to be used in the downstream
MT system.
We see gains in BLEU score across two differ-
ent language pairs, showing empirically that we are

each requires a separate time-consuming downstream MT ex-
periment. In this work, it turns out that scrutinizing 10% of the
data is productive and empirically reasonable.

ously were not in our grammars. These results are
significant with p < 0.05 for Arabic-English and
p < 0.01 for Chinese-English.
4 Discussion
All alignment models we have experimented with
will fall down in the presence of noisy data. Impor-
tantly, even if the alignment model were able to yield
?perfect? alignments with no alignment links among
noisy sections of the parallel data precluding us from
extracting reasonable rules or phrase pairs, wewould
still have to deal with downstream rule extraction
heuristics and their tendency to blow up a translation
grammar in the presence of large swaths of unaligned
words. Absent a mechanism within the alignment
model itself to deal with this problem, we provide a
simple way to recover from noisy data without the
introduction of new tools.
Summing up, parallel data in the world is not
unlimited. We cannot always continue to double
our data for increased performance. Parallel data
creation is expensive, and automatic discovery is
resource-intensive (Uszkoreit et al, 2010). We have
presented a technique that helps to squeeze more out
of an already large, state-of-the-art MT system, us-
ing existing pieces of the pipeline to do so in a novel
way.

Abstract
We present a simple yet powerful hier-
archical search algorithm for automatic
word alignment. Our algorithm induces
a forest of alignments from which we
can efficiently extract a ranked k-best list.
We score a given alignment within the
forest with a flexible, linear discrimina-
tive model incorporating hundreds of fea-
tures, and trained on a relatively small
amount of annotated data. We report re-
sults on Arabic-English word alignment
and translation tasks. Our model out-
performs a GIZA++ Model-4 baseline by
6.3 points in F-measure, yielding a 1.1
BLEU score increase over a state-of-the-art
syntax-based machine translation system.
1 Introduction
Automatic word alignment is generally accepted
as a first step in training any statistical machine
translation system. It is a vital prerequisite for
generating translation tables, phrase tables, or syn-
tactic transformation rules. Generative alignment
models like IBM Model-4 (Brown et al, 1993)
have been in wide use for over 15 years, and while
not perfect (see Figure 1), they are completely un-
supervised, requiring no annotated training data to
learn alignments that have powered many current
state-of-the-art translation system.
Today, there exist human-annotated alignments
and an abundance of other information for many
language pairs potentially useful for inducing ac-
curate alignments. How can we take advantage
of all of this data at our fingertips? Using fea-
ture functions that encode extra information is one
good way. Unfortunately, as Moore (2005) points
out, it is usually difficult to extend a given genera-
tive model with feature functions without chang-
ing the entire generative story. This difficulty

has motivated much recent work in discriminative
modeling for word alignment (Moore, 2005; Itty-
cheriah and Roukos, 2005; Liu et al, 2005; Taskar
et al, 2005; Blunsom and Cohn, 2006; Lacoste-
Julien et al, 2006; Moore et al, 2006).
We present in this paper a discriminative align-
ment model trained on relatively little data, with
a simple, yet powerful hierarchical search proce-
dure. We borrow ideas from both k-best pars-
ing (Klein and Manning, 2001; Huang and Chi-
ang, 2005; Huang, 2008) and forest-based, and
hierarchical phrase-based translation (Huang and
Chiang, 2007; Chiang, 2007), and apply them to
word alignment.
Using a foreign string and an English parse
tree as input, we formulate a bottom-up search
on the parse tree, with the structure of the tree
as a backbone for building a hypergraph of pos-
sible alignments. Our algorithm yields a forest of

Figure 2: Example of approximate search through a hypergraph with beam size = 5. Each black square
implies a partial alignment. Each partial alignment at each node is ranked according to its model score.
In this figure, we see that the partial alignment implied by the 1-best hypothesis at the leftmost NP
node is constructed by composing the best hypothesis at the terminal node labeled ?the? and the 2nd-
best hypothesis at the terminal node labeled ?man?. (We ignore terminal nodes in this toy example.)
Hypotheses at the root node imply full alignment structures.
word alignments, from which we can efficiently
extract the k-best. We handle an arbitrary number
of features, compute them efficiently, and score
alignments using a linear model. We train the
parameters of the model using averaged percep-
tron (Collins, 2002) modified for structured out-
puts, but can easily fit into a max-margin or related
framework. Finally, we use relatively little train-
ing data to achieve accurate word alignments. Our
model can generate arbitrary alignments and learn
from arbitrary gold alignments.
2 Word Alignment as a Hypergraph
Algorithm input The input to our alignment al-
gorithm is a sentence-pair (en1, f
m
1 ) and a parse tree
over one of the input sentences. In this work,
we parse our English data, and for each sentence
E = en1, let T be its syntactic parse. To gener-
ate parse trees, we use the Berkeley parser (Petrov
et al, 2006), and use Collins head rules (Collins,
2003) to head-out binarize each tree.
Overview We present a brief overview here and
delve deeper in Section 2.1. Word alignments are
built bottom-up on the parse tree. Each node v in
the tree holds partial alignments sorted by score.

(c) Expand the frontier further.
After this step we have our top
k alignments.
Figure 3: Cube pruning with alignment hypotheses to select the top-k alignments at node v with children
?u1, u2?. In this example, k = 3. Each box represents the combination of two partial alignments to create
a larger one. The score in each box is the sum of the scores of the child alignments plus a combination
cost.
Each partial alignment comprises the columns of
the alignment matrix for the e-words spanned by
v, and each is scored by a linear combination of
feature functions. See Figure 2 for a small exam-
ple.
Initial partial alignments are enumerated and
scored at preterminal nodes, each spanning a sin-
gle column of the word alignment matrix. To
speed up search, we can prune at each node, keep-
ing a beam of size k. In the diagram depicted in
Figure 2, the beam is size k = 5.
From here, we traverse the tree nodes bottom-
up, combining partial alignments from child nodes
until we have constructed a single full alignment at
the root node of the tree. If we are interested in the
k-best, we continue to populate the root node until
we have k alignments.1
We use one set of feature functions for preter-
minal nodes, and another set for nonterminal
nodes. This is analogous to local and nonlo-
cal feature functions for parse-reranking used by
Huang (2008). Using nonlocal features at a non-
terminal node emits a combination cost for com-
posing a set of child partial alignments.
Because combination costs come into play, we
use cube pruning (Chiang, 2007) to approxi-
mate the k-best combinations at some nonterminal
node v. Inference is exact when only local features
are used.
Assumptions There are certain assumptions re-
lated to our search algorithm that we must make:
1We use approximate dynamic programming to store
alignments, keeping only scored lists of pointers to initial
single-column spans. Each item in the list is a derivation that
implies a partial alignment.
(1) that using the structure of 1-best English syn-
tactic parse trees is a reasonable way to frame and
drive our search, and (2) that F-measure approxi-
mately decomposes over hyperedges.
We perform an oracle experiment to validate
these assumptions. We find the oracle for a given
(T ,e, f ) triple by proceeding through our search al-
gorithm, forcing ourselves to always select correct
links with respect to the gold alignment when pos-
sible, breaking ties arbitrarily. The the F1 score of
our oracle alignment is 98.8%, given this ?perfect?
model.
2.1 Hierarchical search
Initial alignments We can construct a word
alignment hierarchically, bottom-up, by making
use of the structure inherent in syntactic parse
trees. We can think of building a word alignment
as filling in an M?N matrix (Figure 1), and we be-
gin by visiting each preterminal node in the tree.
Each of these nodes spans a single e word. (Line
2 in Algorithm 1).
From here we can assign links from each e word
to zero or more f words (Lines 6?14). At this
level of the tree the span size is 1, and the par-
tial alignment we have made spans a single col-
umn of the matrix. We can make many such partial
alignments depending on the links selected. Lines
5 through 9 of Algorithm 1 enumerate either the
null alignment, single-link alignments, or two-link
alignments. Each partial alignment is scored and
stored in a sorted heap (Lines 9 and 13).
In practice enumerating all two-link alignments
can be prohibitive for long sentence pairs; we set
a practical limit and score only pairwise combina-

scoring single-
link alignments.
We limit the number of total partial alignments
?v kept at each node to k. If at any time we wish to
push onto the heap a new partial alignment when
the heap is full, we pop the current worst off the
heap and replace it with our new partial alignment
if its score is better than the current worst.
Building the hypergraph We now visit internal
nodes (Line 16) in the tree in bottom-up order. At
each nonterminal node v we wish to combine the
partial alignments of its children u1, . . . , uc. We
use cube pruning (Chiang, 2007; Huang and Chi-
ang, 2007) to select the k-best combinations of the
partial alignments of u1, . . . , uc (Line 19). Note

that Algorithm 1 assumes a binary tree2, but is not
necessary. In the general case, cube pruning will
operate on a d-dimensional hypercube, where d is
the branching factor of node v.
We cannot enumerate and score every possibil-
ity; without the cube pruning approximation, we
will have kc possible combinations at each node,
exploding the search space exponentially. Figure 3
depicts how we select the top-k alignments at a
node v from its children ? u1, u2 ?.
3 Discriminative training
We incorporate all our new features into a linear
model and learn weights for each using the on-
line averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002)
with a few modifications for structured outputs in-
spired by Chiang et al (2008). We define:

Model 4 alignments is a weak distortion model.
The second English ?in? is aligned to the wrong
Arabic token. Circles show the gold alignment.
?(y) = `(yi, y) + w ? (h(yi) ? h(y)) (1)
where `(yi,y) is a loss function describing how bad
it is to guess y when the correct answer is yi. In our
case, we define `(yi,y) as 1?F1(yi,y). We select the
oracle alignment according to:
y+ = arg min
y?????(x)
?(y) (2)
where ????(x) is a set of hypothesis alignments
generated from input x. Instead of the traditional
oracle, which is calculated solely with respect to
the loss `(yi,y), we choose the oracle that jointly
minimizes the loss and the difference in model
score to the true alignment. Note that Equation 2
is equivalent to maximizing the sum of the F-
measure and model score of y:
y+ = arg max
y?????(x)
(F1(yi, y) + w ? h(y)) (3)
Let y? be the 1-best alignment according to our
model:
y? = arg max
y?????(x)
w ? h(y) (4)
Then, at each iteration our weight update is:
w? w + ?(h(y+) ? h(y?)) (5)
where ? is a learning rate parameter.3 We find
that this more conservative update gives rise to a
much more stable search. After each iteration, we
expect y+ to get closer and closer to the true yi.
4 Features
Our simple, flexible linear model makes it easy to
throw in many features, mapping a given complex

alignment structure into a single high-dimensional
feature vector. Our hierarchical search framework
allows us to compute these features when needed,
and affords us extra useful syntactic information.
We use two classes of features: local and non-
local. Huang (2008) defines a feature h to be lo-
cal if and only if it can be factored among the lo-
cal productions in a tree, and non-local otherwise.
Analogously for alignments, our class of local fea-
tures are those that can be factored among the local
partial alignments competing to comprise a larger
span of the matrix, and non-local otherwise. These
features score a set of links and the words con-
nected by them.
Feature development Our features are inspired
by analysis of patterns contained among our gold
alignment data and automatically generated parse
trees. We use both local lexical and nonlocal struc-
tural features as described below.
4.1 Local features
These features fire on single-column spans.
? From the output of GIZA++ Model 4, we
compute lexical probabilities p(e | f ) and
p( f | e), as well as a fertility table ?(e).
From the fertility table, we fire features ?0(e),
?1(e), and ?2+(e) when a word e is aligned
to zero, one, or two or more words, respec-
tively. Lexical probability features p(e | f )
and p( f | e) fire when a word e is aligned to
a word f .
? Based on these features, we include a binary
lexical-zero feature that fires if both p(e | f )
and p( f | e) are equal to zero for a given word
pair (e, f ). Negative weights essentially pe-
nalize alignments with links never seen be-
fore in the Model 4 alignment, and positive
weights encourage such links. We employ a
separate instance of this feature for each En-
glish part-of-speech tag: p( f | e, t).
We learn a different feature weight for each.
Critically, this feature tells us how much to
trust alignments involving nouns, verbs, ad-
jectives, function words, punctuation, etc.
from the Model 4 alignments from which our
p(e | f ) and p( f | e) tables are built. Ta-
ble 1 shows a sample of learned weights. In-
tuitively, alignments involving English parts-
of-speech more likely to be content words
(e.g. NNPS, NNS, NN) are more trustworthy

tive weights outright reward such links.
than those likely to be function words (e.g.
TO, RP, EX), where the use of such words is
often radically different across languages.
? We also include a measure of distortion.
This feature returns the distance to the diag-
onal of the matrix for any link in a partial
alignment. If there is more than one link, we
return the distance of the link farthest from
the diagonal.
? As a lexical backoff, we include a tag prob-
ability feature, p(t | f ) that fires for some
link (e, f ) if the part-of-speech tag of e is t.
The conditional probabilities in this table are
computed from our parse trees and the base-
line Model 4 alignments.
? In cases where the lexical probabilities are
too strong for the distortion feature to
overcome (see Figure 5), we develop the
multiple-distortion feature. Although local
features do not know the partial alignments at
other spans, they do have access to the entire
English sentence at every step because our in-
put is constant. If some e exists more than
once in en1 we fire this feature on all links con-
taining word e, returning again the distance to
the diagonal for that link. We learn a strong
negative weight for this feature.
? We find that binary identity and
punctuation-mismatch features are im-
portant. The binary identity feature fires if
e = f , and proves useful for untranslated
numbers, symbols, names, and punctuation
in the data. Punctuation-mismatch fires on
any link that causes nonpunctuation to be
aligned to punctuation.
Additionally, we include fine-grained versions of
the lexical probability, fertility, and distortion fea-
tures. These fire for for each link (e, f ) and part-
of-speech tag. That is, we learn a separate weight
for each feature for each part-of-speech tag in our
data. Given the tag of e, this affords the model the
ability to pay more or less attention to the features
described above depending on the tag given to e.

here language specific features we implement to
exploit shallow Arabic morphology.

Figure 7: This figure depicts the tree/alignment
structure for which the feature PP-from-prep
fires. The English preposition ?from? is aligned
to Arabic word 	??. Any aligned words in the span
of the sister NP are aligned to words following 	??.
English preposition structure commonly matches
that of Arabic in our gold data. This family of fea-
tures captures these observations.
? We observe the Arabic prefix ?, transliterated
w- and generally meaning and, to prepend to
most any word in the lexicon, so we define
features p?w(e | f ) and p?w( f | e). If f be-
gins with w-, we strip off the prefix and return
the values of p(e | f ) and p( f | e). Otherwise,
these features return 0.
? We also include analogous feature functions
for several functional and pronominal pre-
fixes and suffixes.4
4.2 Nonlocal features
These features comprise the combination cost
component of a partial alignment score and may
fire when concatenating two partial alignments
to create a larger span. Because these features
can look into any two arbitrary subtrees, they
are considered nonlocal features as defined by
Huang (2008).
? Features PP-NP-head, NP-DT-head, and
VP-VP-head (Figure 6) all exploit head-
words on the parse tree. We observe English
prepositions and determiners to often align to
the headword of their sister. Likewise, we ob-
serve the head of a VP to align to the head of
an immediate sister VP.

with, or seemed to provide no significant benefit, and are not
included.
In Figure 4, when the search arrives at the
left-most NPB node, the NP-DT-head fea-
ture will fire given this structure and links
over the span [the ... tests]. When
search arrives at the second NPB node, it
will fire given the structure and links over the
span [the ... missle], but will not fire at
the right-most NPB node.
? Local lexical preference features compete
with the headword features described above.
However, we also introduce nonlocal lexical-
ized features for the most common types of
English and foreign prepositions to also com-
pete with these general headword features.
PP features PP-of-prep, PP-from-prep, PP-
to-prep, PP-on-prep, and PP-in-prep fire at
any PP whose left child is a preposition and
right child is an NP. The head of the PP is one
of the enumerated English prepositions and is
aligned to any of the three most common for-
eign words to which it has also been observed
aligned in the gold alignments. The last con-
straint on this pattern is that all words un-
der the span of the sister NP, if aligned, must
align to words following the foreign preposi-
tion. Figure 7 illustrates this pattern.
? Finally, we have a tree-distance feature to
avoid making too many many-to-one (from
many English words to a single foreign word)
links. This is a simplified version of and sim-
ilar in spirit to the tree distance metric used
in (DeNero and Klein, 2007). For any pair of
links (ei, f ) and (e j, f ) in which the e words
differ but the f word is the same token in
each, return the tree height of first common
ancestor of ei and e j.
This feature captures the intuition that it is
much worse to align two English words at
different ends of the tree to the same foreign
word, than it is to align two English words
under the same NP to the same foreign word.
To see why a string distance feature that
counts only the flat horizontal distance from
ei to e j is not the best strategy, consider the
following. We wish to align a determiner
to the same f word as its sister head noun
under the same NP. Now suppose there are
several intermediate adjectives separating the
determiner and noun. A string distance met-
163
ric, with no knowledge of the relationship be-
tween determiner and noun will levy a much
heavier penalty than its tree distance analog.

Recent work has shown the potential for syntac-
tic information encoded in various ways to sup-
port inference of superior word alignments. Very
recent work in word alignment has also started to
report downstream effects on BLEU score.
Cherry and Lin (2006) introduce soft syntac-
tic ITG (Wu, 1997) constraints into a discrimi-
native model, and use an ITG parser to constrain
the search for a Viterbi alignment. Haghighi et
al. (2009) confirm and extend these results, show-
ing BLEU improvement for a hierarchical phrase-
based MT system on a small Chinese corpus.
As opposed to ITG, we use a linguistically mo-
tivated phrase-structure tree to drive our search
and inform our model. And, unlike ITG-style ap-
proaches, our model can generate arbitrary align-
ments and learn from arbitrary gold alignments.
DeNero and Klein (2007) refine the distor-
tion model of an HMM aligner to reflect tree
distance instead of string distance. Fossum et
al. (2008) start with the output from GIZA++
Model-4 union, and focus on increasing precision
by deleting links based on a linear discriminative
model exposed to syntactic and lexical informa-
tion.
Fraser and Marcu (2007) take a semi-supervised
approach to word alignment, using a small amount
of gold data to further tune parameters of a
headword-aware generative model. They show
a significant improvement over a Model-4 union
baseline on a very large corpus.
6 Experiments
We evaluate our model and and resulting align-
ments on Arabic-English data against those in-
duced by IBM Model-4 using GIZA++ (Och and
Ney, 2003) with both the union and grow-diag-
final heuristics. We use 1,000 sentence pairs and
gold alignments from LDC2006E86 to train model
parameters: 800 sentences for training, 100 for
testing, and 100 as a second held-out development
set to decide when to stop perceptron training. We
also align the test data using GIZA++5 along with
50 million words of English.
5We use a standard training procedure: 5 iterations of
Model-1, 5 iterations of HMM, 3 iterations of Model-3, and 3
iterations of Model-4.

6.1 Alignment Quality
We empirically choose our beam size k from the
results of a series of experiments, setting k=1, 2,
4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. We find setting k = 16 to yield
the highest accuracy on our held-out test data. Us-
ing wider beams results in higher F-measure on
training data, but those gains do not translate into
higher accuracy on held-out data.
The first three columns of Table 2 show the
balanced F-measure, Precision, and Recall of our
alignments versus the two GIZA++ Model-4 base-
lines. We report an F-measure 8.6 points over
Model-4 union, and 6.3 points over Model-4 grow-
diag-final.

Table 2: F-measure, Precision, Recall, the resulting BLEU score, and number of unknown words on a
held-out test corpus for three types of alignments. BLEU scores are case-insensitive IBM BLEU. We
show a 1.1 BLEU increase over the strongest baseline, Model-4 grow-diag-final. This is statistically
significant at the p < 0.01 level.
Figure 8 shows the stability of the search proce-
dure over ten random restarts of parallel averaged
perceptron training with 40 CPUs. Training ex-
amples are randomized at each epoch, leading to
slight variations in learning curves over time but
all converge into the same general neighborhood.
Figure 9 shows the robustness of the model to
initial alignments used to derive lexical features
p(e | f ) and p( f | e). In addition to IBM Model 4,
we experiment with alignments from Model 1 and
the HMM model. In each case, we significantly
outperform the baseline GIZA++ Model 4 align-
ments on a heldout test set.
6.2 MT Experiments
We align a corpus of 50 million words with
GIZA++ Model-4, and extract translation rules
from a 5.4 million word core subset. We align
the same core subset with our trained hypergraph
alignment model, and extract a second set of trans-
lation rules. For each set of translation rules, we
train a machine translation system and decode a
held-out test corpus for which we report results be-
low.
We use a syntax-based translation system for
these experiments. This system transforms Arabic
strings into target English syntax trees Translation
rules are extracted from (e-tree, f -string, align-
ment) triples as in (Galley et al, 2004; Galley et
al., 2006).
We use a randomized language model (similar
to that of Talbot and Brants (2008)) of 472 mil-
lion English words. We tune the the parameters
of the MT system on a held-out development cor-
pus of 1,172 parallel sentences, and test on a held-
out parallel corpus of 746 parallel sentences. Both
corpora are drawn from the NIST 2004 and 2006
evaluation data, with no overlap at the document
or segment level with our training data.
Columns 4 and 5 in Table 2 show the results
of our MT experiments. Our hypergraph align-
ment algorithm allows us a 1.1 BLEU increase over
the best baseline system, Model-4 grow-diag-final.
This is statistically significant at the p < 0.01
level. We also report a 2.4 BLEU increase over
a system trained with alignments from Model-4
union.
7 Conclusion
We have opened up the word alignment task to
advances in hypergraph algorithms currently used
in parsing and machine translation decoding. We
treat word alignment as a parsing problem, and
by taking advantage of English syntax and the hy-
pergraph structure of our search algorithm, we re-
port significant increases in both F-measure and
BLEU score over standard baselines in use by most
state-of-the-art MT systems today.
