Abstract 
We present a Chinese word segmentation 
system which ran on the closed track of the 
simplified Chinese Word Segmentation task 
of CIPS-SIGHAN-CLP 2010 bakeoffs. Our 
segmenter was built using a HMM. To fulfill 
the cross-domain segmentation task, we use 
semi-supervised machine learning method to 
get the HMM model. Finally we get the 
mean result of four domains: P=0.719, 
R=0.72 
1 Introduction 
The 2010 Sighan Bakeoff included two types 
of evaluations: 
(1) Closed training:  In the closed training 
evaluation, participants can only use data 
provided by organizers to train their systems 
specifically, the following data resources and 
software tools are not permitted to be used in 
the training: 
1) Unspecified corpus;  
2) Unspecified dictionary, word list or 
character list: include the dictionaries 
of named entity, character lists for 
specific type of Chinese named entities, 
idiom dictionaries, semantic lexicons, 
etc.  
3) Human-encoded rule bases;  
4) Unspecified software tools, include 
word segmenters, part-of-speech 
taggers, or parsers which are trained 
using unspecified data resources.  
The character type information to distinguish 
the following four character types can be 
used in training: Chinese characters, English 
letters, digits and punctuations. 
(2) Open training:  In the open training 
evaluation, participants can use any language 
resource, including the training data provided 
by organizers 
We prefer character-based Tagging than 
dictionary based word segmentation in closed 
training, for we can only use the provide train 
corpus and scale of the corpus is not large 
enough. If we select dictionary based method 
we will encounter the out-of-vocabulary 
problem. But in character-based Tagging 
method we can yield a better performance 
than the dictionary based method for such 
problem. 
2 Algorithm 
Ever before 2002 almost all word segment 
method is based on dictionary.  In SIGHAN 
2003 bakeoff, a character-based Tagging 
method was proposed and since then the 
character-based Tagging method became 
more and more popular. HMM (Hidden 
Markov Model) has been used extensively in 
speech recognition, pos tagging and get good 
grades. So we chose HMM as our machine 
learning method to fulfill our task. 
We formally define the elements of an HMM, 
and explain how the model generates an 
observation sequence. 
An HMM is characterized by the following: 
1) N, the number of states in the model. we 
denote the individual states as 
s={s?, s?,? , s?},and the state at time t as 
q? 
2) M, the number of distinct observation 
symbols per state. we denote the 
individual symbols as v={v?, v?, . . , v?} 
This work was supported by the national natural science foundation of China (60873013)?Beijing natural science foundation (KZ200811232019); The Open 
Project Program of the Key Laboratory of Computational Linguistics (Peking University), Ministry of Education;Funding Project for Academic Human Resources 
Devel-opment in Institutions of Higher Learning Under the Juris-diction of Beijing Municipality (PHR201007131) 
3) The state transition probability 
distribution A= { a?) } where a?) =P 
[q??? ?s)|q??s?], 1<i,j<N. 
4) The observation symbol probability 
distribution in state j, B={b)?k?}, where 
b)?k??P?v? at t|q??s)? 
5) The initial state distribution ???? 
where ?? ?P?q? ?s?? 
 
Graph1 
For convenience, we use the compact 
notation???A,B, ?) to indicate the complete 
parameter set of the model. 
There are three basic problems for HMM, for 
problem 1 we use forward-backward 
algorithm, for problem 2 we use Viterbi 
algorithm, for problem 3 we use 
Baum-Welch algorithm. 
To application HMM to our task we define 
the HMM five factors as blow: 
1) We define the whole labels set as Q={B, 
M, E, S}, B represents word?s begin, M 
represents word?s middle, E represents 
word?s end and S represents single word. 
2) We define all Unicode characters as O  
3) We define A={a?)}, where a?)=P[prior 
token=s?|posterior label =s)] 
4) We define B={ b)?k? }, where 
b)?k?=P[current character= v? |current 
label =s)] 
5) We define a sentence as a train sample. 
So ?={sentences start with s, s ? Q}. 
Through the design we transform the 
character-based tagging problem to HMM 
problem 2. So we can solve this problem 
with Viterbi algorithm.  
3  Experiment 
We use HMM to establish the Word 
Segment prototype system and make use of 
the Labeled supplied by the Chinese 
Academy of  Sciences to train the HMM 
and get the model parameters which will be 
used for the next iterative scaling. After that, 
we can get a system based on HMM model. 
Then, with the help of the gotten system, we 
process the unlabeled corpus. Once it is 
finished, we should add the processed corpus 
to the labeled corpus and get a larger corpus 
with which we can retrain the HMM. All 
these steps have been done according four 
test corpuses: literature, computer, medicine, 
finance. In the table, R indicates the recall 
rate, P indicates the precision rate, F1 
indicates the macro average, OOV R 
indicates the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate, 
OOV RR indicates the out-of-vocabulary 
(OOV) self repair rate, IV RR indicates the 
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) self repair rate. In 
order to more easily view data, we have 
presented the Graph2. 
From the table and graph, we can see that the 
finance corpus has a better result, the 
computer corpus don't show a good result for 
the R, P, F1. Generally speaking, this result 
is a reflection for the difference between the 
dictionary based Tagging method and 
character-based Tagging method. After 
recheck our corpus, we can find that there 
are more technical terms in the computer 
corpus than finance corpus. The explanation 
for the result is that if the system encounter a 
technical terms, the character-based Tagging 
method will have a bad performance. In such 
situation, dictionary based Tagging method 
may have a better performance. For the OOV 
R and OOV RR, the system has a not bad 
performance. Table I and Graph2 show the 
detailed experimental data.

4 Conclusion 
 Our system used a HMM and 
semi-supervised learning for domain 
adapting. Our final system achieved a 
P=0.719, R=0.72. There exist two ways to 
improve our system performance one is 
instead our model of CRF, the other is 
change another way to use the unlabeled data. 
Because the inherent shortage of HMM we 
could not get a precise model, and the way 
we use the unlabeled data can import err to 
labeled data.
