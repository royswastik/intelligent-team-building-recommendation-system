Abstract
Modern Chinese Mandarin has gone 
through near a hundred years, it is very 
important to store its representative 
sample in digital form permanently. In 
this paper, we propose a Chinese Man-
darin Digital Multi-modal Corpus 
(CMDMC), which is a digital speech 
museum with diachronic, opened, cross-
media and sharable features. It has over 
3460 hours video and audio files with 
metadata tagging. The materials, which 
were generated by the authoritative 
speakers (e.g. announcers at TV or radio 
station) with normality, are required 
samples if we can get them. Based on 
this resource, we also intend to analyze 
the syntactic correlations of prosodic 
phrase in broadcasting news speech, and 
compare the phonetic and prosodic fea-
tures in movie dialogues among several 
same-name movies in different histori-
cal eras.
1 Introduction
Modern Chinese Mandarin has gone through 
near a hundred years. As language changes as 
society develops, Mandarin must be periodically 
marked with the different features of different 
historical eras. It is very important to design and 
construct a Chinese Mandarin Digital Multi-
modal Corpus (CMDMC), and store its repre-
sentative sample in digital form permanently.
It?s international trend to establish large-scale 
natural language corpus, and many countries 
pay more attention to research and preserve 
their national language. For instance, the Lin-
guistic Data Consortium (LDC) is an open con-
sortium of universities, companies and govern-
ment research laboratories. It creates, collects 
and distributes speech and text databases, lex-
icons, and other resources for research and de-
velopment purposes1. Since its foundation, the 
LDC has delivered data to 197 member institu-
tions and 458 non-member institutions. Moreo-
ver, European Language Resources Association 
(ELRA)2
The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 
describes the resources and data processing of 
our CMDMC. The experiment and evaluation is 
designed and carried out in section 3. Section 4 
is dedicated to analyze the syntactic correlations 
of prosodic phrase in broadcast news speech on 
CNR (China National Radio), and compare the 
is the driving force to make available 
the language resources for language engineering 
and to evaluate language engineering technolo-
gies. In order to achieve this goal, ELRA is ac-
tive in identification, distribution, collection, 
validation, standardization, improvement, in 
promoting the production of language resources, 
in supporting the infrastructure to perform eval-
uation campaigns and in developing a scientific 
field of language resources and evaluation. In
this paper, we intend to establish the CMDMC 
with the goal of showing the history of the de-
velopment of Chinese Mandarin, and represen-
tation the real character in different historical 
eras.

gues. Finally, some conclusions and outlines of 
our future work are given in section 5.
2 General Description of CMDMC
In order to show the history of the development 
of Chinese Mandarin, and representation the 
real character in different historical periods, the 
CMDMC, which is a dynamic miniature model 
(or speech museum) with diachronic, opened, 
cross-media and sharable features, is designed
and constructed by Broadcast Media Language 
Branch of National Language Resources 
Monitor & Research Center at Communication 
University of China.
In China, announcers in Radio & TV stations, 
as well as movie or stage actors, are the authori-
ty of the national language standardization. 
Therefore, the speech in radio, television and 
movie can be taken as the paradigm and repre-
sentative of Mandarin. They can reflect the 
phonetic situation of that era. All of these are 
the source of the sample data for CMDMC.
2.1 Description of Resources
In order to fully demonstrate the development 
of Chinese Mandarin by the past 100 years, we 
try to collect all the video or audio materials in 
different periods. Therefore, a state-of-the-art 
classification is defined based on the corpora 
that we got.
Language styles: According to characteristic 
speaking styles of different media, there are 
three categories was defined, such as broadcast 
media language, movie or drama dialogue, and 
the dialogue in folk art (e.g. xiangsheng, ping-
shu etc.) and so on. To sum up, the three speak-
ing styles accounted for about 64.9%, 27.2%
and 7.9% of total corpora, respectively.
Mediums: The materials can be divided into 
audio, video, text and image/picture. The audio 
or video files are the main materials in our cor-
pus, and the aligned texts are transcribed based 
on the audio or video. The documents of image 
are subsidiary corpora.
Historical eras: Based on the characteristics 
of social and language changes, we also define 
six historical stages of Chinese Mandarin: 1) 
Before1949 (or 1919-1949), it is a theoretical
stage for corpora collection. In fact, the earliest 
speech materials, which we can collect, is re-
leased in 1932; 2) 1949-1965; 3) 1966-1977; 4) 
1978-1989; 5) 1990-1999; 6) 2000 to today.

in different eras.

2.2 Data Processing
The data processing includes metadata tagging, 
text transcription and aligning, phonetic and 
prosodic annotation, POS and syntactic tagging
and so on.
As for labeling prosodic phrase boundaries, 
we strictly dependent on the prosodic criteria 
and perception by using the wave files and their 
transcriptions, which use many prosodic fea-
tures such as F0 contour, energy contour etc. At 
the same time, some spoken phenomena are 
considered.
3 Experiment and Evaluation
Firstly, in order to investigate the correlations 
between prosody and syntax, about 13 hours 
speech materials were selected to segment and 
label, including break index, stress index and 
summary of emotional tendentiousness etc.
Before the real annotation, six transcribers have 
been trained in accordance with the prosodic 
labeling conventions, until a high consistency of 
prosodic annotation can be carried out.
According to above experiment and annota-
tion, the number of occurrences of the various 
boundaries was calculated in table 2.
Secondly, we also designed a perception ex-
periment to determine phonetic diversification
for elimination as much as possible the subjec-
tivity which could be caused by the different 
personal intuition of language. Ten people at-
tended the perception experiment of this study:
3 men and 7 women. The average age is 25 
years. Nearly all of them were graduates major-
ing in linguistics. During the experiment, the 
participants were asked to discriminate 12 para-
graphs of random materials and judge the natu-
ralness, pitch, and speech rate of the sentences 
produced in each paragraph. These 12 para-
graphs consisted of 4 from 21 paragraphs of the 
1995 version, 4 from 21 paragraphs of the 1975 
version and 4 from modern materials.

PP, C-PP, IP, IG and MEC are the abbreviation of 
prosodic word, normal prosodic phrase, complex 
prosodic phrase, intonational phrase, intonational 
group and meaning expression cluster respectively.
In the perceptive procedure, we disordered all 
these materials for experiment, and three choic-
es were given to these ten people: 1) natural, in 
conformity with the standard of modern Manda-
rin; 2) fairly natural, close to the standard of 
modern Mandarin; 3) unnatural, a little stagy. 
Every paragraph was released twice with an 
interval of 10 seconds. After one hour of conti-
nuous work, a 10-minute break was given.
Only the results with at least a 90% agree-
ment rate were considered for analysis. 
4 Related Works
Based on this resource, we intend to analyze the 
syntactic correlations of prosodic phrase in 
broadcasting news speech on CNR, and com-
pare the phonetic and prosodic features in 
movie dialogues among several same-name 
movies in different historical eras.
4.1 Correlation between Syntax & Prosody
In English, there is a strong correlation between 
prosodic phrase boundaries and syntactic phrase 
boundaries (Price et al 1991). That is to say, 
prosodic phrase boundaries can play an impor-
tant role in understanding utterance as punctua-
tion marks do in written language. An investiga-
tion propose that boundary strength according to 
the measure, which the boundary strength is 
applied to syntactic structures and the phrase 
structure is viewed as an immediate constituen-
cy tree exclusively, corresponds much more 
closely to empirical prosodic boundary strength 
than does syntactic boundary strength according 
to a standard measure (Abney, 1992). In Greek, 
some study indicated that prosodic phrasing has 
a 95% identification rate, and a major effect on 
final tonal boundaries (Botinis et al 2004).
In Chinese, some researchers also proposed a 
statistical model to predict prosodic words from 
lexical words. In their model, both length of the 
word and the tagging from POS are two essen-
tial features to predict prosodic words, and the 
results showed approximately 90% of prediction 
for prosodic words (Chen at el. 2004).
What the correlation between syntax and 
prosody is in Chinese broadcasting news speech?
In order to investigate the syntactic correlations 
of prosodic phrase in real read speech on radio, 
we chose the representative speech materials 
from Xinwen he Baozhi Zhaiyao (News and 
Newspapers Summary) from CMDMC, which is 
a very famous broadcast news program of CNR.
This news program contains more syntactic, 
semantic and prosodic information, speaking
styles and high quality voice in real context. 
Therefore, 908 programs, which contain 454 
hours speech data from January 2006 to June 
2008, were selected for pre-processing. After 
the pre-processing step, we selected two fe-
male?s 13 hours speech materials (one female 
announcer?s material forms the main data, and 
another one?s is supplemented for comparable 
data) as a core database, which segmentation, 
transcription and prosodic annotation (including 
break index, stress index and summary of emo-
tional tendentiousness etc) was made by six 
transcribers. 
According to the characteristic of broadcast-
ing news speech, a new prosodic hierarchical 
structure (Zou et al 2009) and two different 
types of prosodic phrase (i.e. the normal prosod-
ic phrase and the complex prosodic phrase) 
boundaries were defined and used in our data 
labeling.

Table 3: The distribution of pitch on different boundaries. The phonetic acoustic data of each 
syllable was extracted by Praat script, and the foundational frequency was normalized by semi-
tones, the normalization formula is ST=12*log (F0/Fref)/log2 (the female?s reference frequency 
is 100Hz). (?top? is the mean of the highest pitch value at the first tone and the fourth tone; 
?bottom? is the mean of the lowest pitch value at the third tone and the fourth tone; ?N? refers 
the number of samples; ?SD? is the abbreviation of standard deviation)
In the further step, we selected 100 minutes 
speech materials from core annotated data, and 
investigated its features of pitch and duration at 
boundary (Zou et al 2010). The detailed data 
are shown in table 3 and 4 respectively.

Table 4: The mean of silent pause duration at
boundaries.
There are two ways of representation to pitch 
feature at prosodic boundary: Firstly, the pitch 
contour is un-continuity; secondly, the pitch 
resetting of the declination contour (de Pijper et 
al 1994). According to Table 3, we can find that 
there is a few resetting of bottom pitch value at 
PW boundary, that is to say, the bottom of the
PW boundary right is 1.4 semitones higher than 
that of its left. At other boundaries, the bottom 
pitch values at right side are much higher than 
that at left side, for instance, there is 3.1, 5.2, 
9.9, 11.3 and 13.6 semitones resetting from PP 
to MEC boundary successively. Especially, at 
the IP boundary its resetting has about two 
times than that of C-PP boundary. This shows 
that there are very obvious prosodic feature at 
various boundaries in broadcasting news speech.
Generally, we know that 90ms is the floor of 
threshold for perceiving the silent pause. From 
Table 4, the mean of silent pause duration from 
long to short followed by MEC > IG > IP > C-
PP > PP > PW. Except there is no perceived 
silent pause at PW boundary, the other bounda-
ries have obvious silent pause that can be per-
ceived. The length of silent pause at PP and C-
PP are 97.6ms and 108.7ms respectively, and 
the length at IP has over three times longer than 
that at C-PP. According to this, we propose that 
the PP and C-PP lie in the same position at the 
prosodic hierarchical structure, and the C-PP is 
a special prosodic phrase.
From our core data we got 6728 C-PPs. Ac-
cording to the C-PP that contains the number of 
PW, we divided them into four categories, such 
as three-PW, four-PW, five-PW and six-PW. 
The distribution of them is shown in Table 5.
After preliminary analysis we found that the 
C-PP, which contains three PWs, has a simple 
syntactic structure although it is absolute major-
ity in the number, and that is compose of four 
PWs should be done for correlations of prosody 
and syntax. There are about 6 types of prosodic 
structure if the C-PP contains four PWs. The 
detail data of this type C-PP followed in table 6.
From the data, we know that the fourth type, 
which is (A+B) +(C+D), is the most, and that is 
composed by (A+B) +C+D is the least in all of 
the six types. Although there are just six types 
of prosodic structure that can be found, there are 
more than 985 syntactic categories in this 1835 
C-PPs. There are 23 types which occur more 
than 10 times, and most of them occur only one 
time. To some extent, it can explain that the 
syntactic structure is more complex than the 
prosodic one.
An example of prosodic and syntactic struc-
tures in the utterance, which is ou1 yang2 yu3 
hang2 yi4 zhi1 shou3 jin3 jin0 bao4 zhu4 lou2 
ti1 de0 lan2 gan1 (Ouyang Yuhang held fast to 
the staircase railing with one hand), is given in 
figure 1. The left side of figure is the prosodic 
structure, and the syntactic one lies at the right 
side.
In figure 1, there is a little difference of jin3 
jin0 bao4 zhu4 lou2 ti1 de0 lan2 gan1 (???
??????) between its prosodic structure 
?A+(B+C+D)? and its syntactic structure ?[VP 
[VP jin3jin0/adv bao4zhu4/v] [NP [AP 
lou2ti1/n de0/u] [NP lan2gan1/n]]]?, but the 
differences between its prosodic and syntactic 
structure are obvious because the jin3 jin0 is 
stressed in speech for semantic expression.

Figure 2 shows the pitch contour of the same 
utterance. In this utterance, there is a nesting 
structure at jin3 jin0 bao4 zhu4 lou2 ti1 de0 
lan2 gan1 (held fast to the staircase railing)
based on the length of perceived silent pause. 
Furthermore, the pitch declination trend within 
the C-PP is obvious despite small resetting be-
tween zhu4 and lou2. So we suggest that there is 
a stable prosodic pattern within a C-PP in 
broadcasting news speech.
Conversely, what is the correlation between 
the prosody and syntax? From above analysis, 
we know that the conjunction and particle, such
as?(de0), ?(deng3),?(he2), ?(dan4) and so 
on, more likely attached to the end of left struc-
ture or the beginning of right one and form a 
prosodic word. If it has just four lexical words 
including the conjunction or particle they form a 
prosodic word by itself. That is to say, it has 
very great flexibility in prosodic structures for 
conjunctions and particles, such as ? ?
(zhan4)/1+ ??(quan2guo2)/1 ??(shi1di4)/1 
???(mian4ji1 de0)/2* (occupy/1+ country-
wide/1everglade/1 acreage/2*)?, ??(he2)/1 ?
? (she4hui4)/2 ? ? (jiu4zhu4)/1 ? ?
(zhi4du4)/2* (and/1 social/2 assistance/1 sys-
tem/2*)? and so on.
4.2 Diachronic Comparative Phonetic and 
Prosodic Analysis in Movie Dialogues
Which diachronic phonetic changes happened in 
Mandarin by the past 100 years? We also ana-
lyze and compare the phonetic features of Chi-
nese Mandarin among several same-name mov-
ies in different historical eras from CMDMC
(Wang et al 2010). In order to minimize the 
divergence of the variables and maximize the 
reliability of conclusions, we chose two pairs of 
same-name movies screened in different histori-
cal periods. These movies are: Pingyuan Youji-
dui (The Plains Guerrillas) shot in 1955 and 
1975, Dujiang Zhencha Ji (Reconnaissance 
across the Yangtze River) shot in 1954 and 1974 
respectively.
Pitch Feature: In the analysis of pitch, we 
put aside the stresses and the neutral tone syl-
lables, and make the statistical investigations on 
the top pitch value and the bottom pitch value of 
the syllables.
Figure 3: The pitch data of 1955 and 1975 ver-
sion in the Plains Guerrillas. The fundamental 
frequency also was normalized by semitones;
the male?s reference frequency is 50Hz.
Figure 3 shows that the mean of the top pitch 
value in the 1950s? materials is lower than that 
of 1970s?. In the 1955 version, the leading cha-
racter, Speaker A, possesses a mean value of the 
top pitch value which is 20.9 semitones. This 
value is lower than that of 1975s? by a differ-
ence of 0.9 semitones. The negative character, 
Speaker B, has a mean value of the top pitch 
value which is 24.5 semitones in the 1955 ver-
sion. The value in the 1975 version is 27 semi-
tones, with a difference of 2.5 semitones left, 
also showing that the value in the 1975 version 
is comparatively high. Comparing the data of 
the bottom pitch value in the 1955 version with 
that in the 1975 version, we know that these 
data seem closer than the top pitch value, but 
still the higher ones belong to the 1975 version. 
That the bottom pitch value is higher tells us 
that the whole pitch register is raised.
Furthermore, we can easily see from Figure 3
that the pitch range of the same character in the 
1975 version is wider. Speaker A of the 1955 
version has a pitch range of 4.8 semitones. In 
contrast, the same character in the 1975 version 
has a pitch range of 6 semitones. Speaker C of
the 1955 version has 4 semitones pitch range, 
but in the 1975 version, he has 5.9 semitones 
pitch range. The gap between them is 1.9 semi-
tones. Through this comparison, we find that the 
pitch range in the 1975 version is wider than 
that in the 1955 version in the whole. 
To some extent, the speaking, both the top
pitch value and the bottom pitch value in the 
1975 version are higher. This proves that, on the 
whole, the pitch of the 1970s? materials is high-
er and more unnatural than that of 50s? because 
of the effect by the Cultural Revolution era.
And this also proves the feeling of the partici-
pants in the perceptional experiment at section 3 
about the 1970s? materials, that is, the 1970s?
Mandarin has a loud and sonorous voice; the 
characters pronounce harder; the general pitch is 
higher.
Duration feature: In the respect of duration, 
we also compared and analyzed the presenters?
speech on TV in 20053
According to table 7, there is a little differ-
ence of the durations mean among them (fol-
lowing four tones), especially it?s very closely 
between the 1975 and the 2005, and those of the 
1975 version are a few longer than those of the 
1955 version. But, except the first tone (Sig. 
=.077), the differences of the duration means 
between the others, which is in the 1955, the 
with the materials ex-
tracted from the movie dialogues the 1955 and 
the 1975. Table 7 is the relevant data.
3 In this work, we just chose the male?s speech data 
from Zou (2007).
1975 and the 2005, are significant (Sig.

Demonstrations of the four-syllable pro-
sodic words: The comparative pitch contour of 
two four-syllable prosodic words, which are 
?bu2 yao4 lu4 mian4? (don?t appear) and ?gan4
shen2 me0 de0? (What are you doing?), are 
shown in Figure 4 and 5, respectively.
Figure 4: The pitch contour of ?bu2 yao4 lu4
mian4? (don?t appear)
Figure 5: The pitch contour of ?gan4 shen2 me0
de0? (What are you doing?)
By observing the above two figures, we find 
that the pitch contour of the 1975 and that of the 
1955 are almost identical except the latter is 
always lower than the former. This may explain 
that although the Mandarin has gone through a 
hundred years, the pitch pattern is relatively 
stable.
5 Conclusions and Future Work
This paper proposes to design a Chinese 
Mandarin Digital Multi-modal Corpus
(CMDMC). Through this corpus, the historical 
trace of Mandarin development can be followed;
the fresh and alive data and material resources 
can be drawn up for the modern researchers and 
successors. We also intend to analyze the syn-
tactic correlations of prosodic phrase in broad-
casting news speech, and compare the phonetic 
and prosodic features in movie dialogues among 
several same-name movies in different histori-
cal eras. The contributions are as follows.
Firstly, the syntactic structure is more com-
plex than the prosodic structure, some conjunc-
tion and particle, such as de0, deng3, he2, dan4
and so on, more likely attached to the end of left 
structure or the beginning of right one and form 
a prosodic word, if the number of lexical words 
mismatch the prosodic words. Otherwise, they 
have almost similar structure.
Secondly, the speech of 1970s in last century 
is greatly influenced by the special era. People 
usually use exaggerated voice, pronounce hard 
and raise the pitch unnaturally, giving others a 
taste of lecturing and ordering. In contrast, the 
speech of Mandarin in 1950s is more natural 
and close to the daily life pronunciation and 
intonation. Even so, the pitch patterns have no 
big changes, and this may explain that the pitch
patterns are comparatively stable in Chinese 
Mandarin.
Future research will include treatment of cor-
relation between syntax and prosody within IP
or IG, ideally comparing the diachronic phonet-
ic or prosodic changes in Mandarin by the past 
100 years. Additionally, we would like to tackle 
the problem of data management, update and 
periodical increasing as time passes.
