Abstract 
The TAP-XL Automated Analyst?s Assistant is 
an application designed to help an English-
speaking analyst write a topical report, culling 
information from a large inflow of multi-
lingual, multimedia data. It gives users the 
ability to spend their time finding more data 
relevant to their task, and gives them 
translingual reach into other languages by 
leveraging human language technology. 
 
1 System Description 
The TAP-XL system exploits language technology to 
monitor the user?s interactions with the system and 
provide suggestions of relevant information to analysts, 
maximizing time spent reading relevant documents and 
writing reports. Any document, passage, or fact that a 
user saves in a report is deemed to be valuable, and the 
TAP-XL system then proactively suggests related 
information that is located in the stream of documents. 
Rather than force the user to learn a suite of distinct 
tools, this ?suggestion? metaphor is employed 
throughout TAP-XL: all language technologies pull 
together to bring value to the user through data, rather 
than via additional tools, interfaces, and metaphors that 
must be learned separately. 
 
2 Use Model 
The user interacts with the TAP-XL system via a 
traditional word processor (Microsoft Word), with an 
additional web-based user interface.  
The user writes a report based on an initial problem 
statement. The problem statement includes names of 
people, locations, and organizations relevant to a topic, 
as well as hypotheses about events involving these 
entities that are to be corroborated or refuted in the 
report. 
Suggestions appear in a window to the left of the 
word processor. The initial set of suggestions is 
generated from the text of the problem statement. Each 
suggestion leads to a document or collection of docu-
ments. Passages from a document deemed relevant by 
the user can be cited in the report via a ?create citation? 
button. This places the selected excerpt in the report, 
along with a hyperlink to the original source document. 
It also triggers the TAP-XL system to provide additional 
suggestions relevant to the passage the user selected, as 
well as documents relevant to any entities included in 
the citation. Suggestions deemed not relevant can be 
deleted. A screenshot of the TAP-XL system in use may 
be seen in Figure 1. 
In addition to the suggestion mechanism, users may 
employ a traditional keyword-based query mechanism 
to locate documents in the system. 
The process of system suggestion ? citation ? 
additional suggestions results in a feedback loop 
between the TAP-XL system and the user?s report. This 
feedback loop is designed to allow many different 
human-language technologies to contribute relevant 
information to the user. 
 
3 System Architecture 
The analytical portion of TAP-XL is a distributed, 
component-based system. Components include Machine 
Translation (Arabic to English), Document Clustering, 
Multi-document Summarization, and Fact Extraction.  
The components are distributed across the Internet, 
using a custom web service technology called the TAP 
Connector. The TAP Connector uses industry-standard 
web protocols to communicate between a requester and 
a provider, allowing distributed computation across the 
Internet with unpredictable data flows and latencies. 
All metadata produced by the components is stored in 
a central data repository, making it available to other 
downstream technologies. 
The system currently processes approximately 1,000 
English newswire documents per day from a 
commercial source, as well as 150 documents per day 
from Arabic newspapers, obtained via web harvesting. 
All Arabic documents are translated to English via 
Machine Translation. The total flow of documents is 
then exposed to all the other downstream technologies 
(Fact Extraction, Document Clustering, and Multi-
document Summarization).

4 Recent Developments 
The TAP-XL system has been under development since 
November of 2002, and was recently used by more than 
12 analysts in an Integrated Feasibility Experiment 
(IFE) under the DARPA TIDES program. The results of 
this IFE will be used to guide future enhancements of 
the TAP-XL system, including user interface 
enhancements, use model improvements, and additional 
language component technology.
