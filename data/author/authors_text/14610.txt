Abstract
In this paper we describe our 
participation in the SIGHAN 2010 Task-
3 (Person Name Disambiguation) and 
detail our approaches. Person Name 
Disambiguation is typically viewed as an 
unsupervised clustering problem where 
the aim is to partition a name?s contexts 
into different clusters, each representing 
a real world people. The key point of 
Clustering is the similarity measure of 
context, which depends upon the features 
selection and representation. Two 
clustering algorithms, HAC and 
DBSCAN, are investigated in our system. 
The experiments show that the topic 
features learned by LDA outperforms
token features and more robust.
1 Introduction
Most current web searches relate to person
names. A study of the query log of the 
AllTheWeb and Altavista search sites gives an 
idea of the relevance of the people search task: 
11-17% of the queries were composed of a 
person name with additional terms and 4% were 
identified simply as person names (Spink et al,
2004).
However, there is a high level of ambiguity 
where multiple individuals share the same name 
and thus the harvesting and the retrieval of 
relevant information becomes more difficult. 
This ambiguity has recently become an active 
research topic and, simultaneously, a relevant 
application domain for Web search services. 
Zoominfo.com, Spock.com and 123people.com 
are examples of sites which perform web people 
search, although with limited disambiguation 
capabilities (Artiles et al, 2009).
This issue directed current researchers 
towards the definition of a new task called Web 
People Search (WePS) or Personal Name 
Disambiguation (PND). The key assumption 
underlying the task is that the context 
surrounding an ambiguous person name is 
indicative of its ascription. The goal of the 
clustering task was to group web pages
containing the target person's name, so that 
pages referring to the same individual are 
assigned to the same cluster. For this purpose a 
large dataset was collected and manually 
annotated.
Moreover, because of the ambiguity in word 
segmentation in Chinese, person name detection
is necessary, which is subtask of Named Entity 
Recognition (NER). NER is one of difficulties 
of the study of natural language processing, of 
which the main task is to identify person names, 
place names, organization names, number, time 
words, money and other entities. The main 
difficulties of Chinese person name entity 
recognition are embodied in the following points: 
1) the diversity of names form; 2) the Chinese 
character within names form words with each; 3) 
names and their context form words; 4) 
translation of foreign names require special 
considerations. 
In this paper we describe our system and
approach in the SIGHAN 2010 task-3 (Person 
Name Disambiguation). A novel Bayesian 
approach is adopt in our system, which
formalizes the disambiguation problem in a 
generative model. For each ambiguous name we 
first draw a distribution over person, and then 
generate context words according to this 
distribution. It is thus assumed that different 
persons will correspond to distinct lexical 
distributions. In this framework, Person Name 
Disambiguation postulates that the observed data 
(contexts) are explicitly intended to 
communicate a latent topic distribution 
corresponding to real world people.
The remainder of this paper is structured as 
follows. We first present an overview of related 
work (Section 2) and then describe our system 
which consists of NER and clustering in more 
details (Sections 3 and 4). Section 5 describes 
the resources and evaluation results in our 
experiments. We discuss our results and 
conclude our work in Section 6.
2 Related Work
The most commonly used feature is the bag of 
words in local or global context of the 
ambiguous name (Ikeda et al, 2009; Romano et 
al., 2009). Because the given corpus is often not 
large enough to learn the realistic probabilities 
or weights for those features, traditional 
algorithm such as vector-based techniques used 
in large-scale text will lead to data sparseness.
In recent years, more and more important 
studies have attempted to overcome the problem
to get a better (semantic) similarity measures. A
lot of features such as syntactic chunks, named 
entities, dependency parses, semantic role labels,
etc., were employed. However, these features 
need many NLP preprocessing (Chen, 2009). 
Many studies show that they can achieve state-
of-the-art performances only with lightweight 
features. Pedersen et al (2005) present
SenseClusters which represents the instances to 
be clustered using second order co?occurrence 
vectors. Kozareva (2008) focuses on the 
resolution of the web people search problem 
through the integration of domain information,
which can represent relationship between 
contexts and is learned from WordNet. PoBOC 
clustering (Cleuziou et al, 2004) is used which 
builds a weighted graph with weights being the
similarity among the objects.
Another way is to utilize universal data
repositories as external knowledge sources (Rao 
et al, 2007; Kalmar and Blume, 2007; Pedersen 
and Kulkarni; 2007) in order to give more
realistic frequency for a proper name or measure 
whether a bigram is a collocation.
Phan et al (2008) presents a general 
framework for building classifiers that deal with 
short and sparse text and Web segments by
making the most of hidden topics discovered 
from large-scale data collections. Samuel Brody 
et al (2009) adopt a novel Bayesian approach 
and formalize the word sense induction problem 
in a generative model.
Previous work using the WePS1 (Artiles et al,
2007) or WePS2 data set (Artiles et al, 2009) 
shows that standard document clustering 
methods can deliver excellent performance if 
similarity measure is enough good to represent 
relationship of context.
The study in Chinese PND is still in its 
infancy. Person Name detection is often 
necessary in Chinese. At present, the main 
technology of person name recognition is used 
statistical models, and the hybrid approach. Liu
et al (2000) designed a Chinese person name 
recognition system based on statistical methods, 
using samples of names from the text corpus and 
the real amount of statistical data to improve the 
system performance, while the shortcoming is 
that samples of name database are too small, 
resulting in low recall. Li et al (2006) use the 
combination of the boundary templates and local 
statistics to recognize Chinese person name, the 
recognition process is to use the boundary with 
the frequency of template to identify potential 
names, and to recognize the results spread to the 
entire article in order to recall missing names 
caused by sparse data.
3 Person Name Recognition
In this section, we focus on Conditional Random 
Fields (CRFs) algorithm to establish the 
appropriate language model. Given of the input 
text, we may detect the potential person names 
in the text fragments, and then take various 
features into account to recognize of Chinese 
person names.
Conditional Random Fields as a sequence 
learning method has been successfully applied in 
many NLP tasks. More details of the its 
principle can be referred in (Lafferty, McCallum, 
and Pereira, 2001; Wallach, 2004). We here will 
focus on how to apply CRFs in our person name 
recognition task.
3.1 CRFs-based name recognition
CRFs is used to get potential names as the first 
stage name recognition outcome. To avoid the 
interference that caused by word segmentation 
errors, we use single Chinese character 
information rather than word as discriminative 
features for CRFs learning model. 
We use BIEO label strategy to transfer the name 
recognition as a sequence learning task. The 
label set includes: B-Nr (Begin, the initial 
character of name), I-Nr (In, the middle 
character of name), E-Nr(End, the end character 
of name) and O (Other, other characters that 
aren?t name).
3.2 Rule-based Correction
After labeling the potential names by CRFs 
model, we apply a set of rules to boost 
recognition result, which has been proved to be 
the key to improve Chinese name recognition.
The error of the potential names outcome by 
CRFs model is mainly divided into the following 
categories: the initial character of name is not 
recognized, the middle character of name is not 
recognized, the end character of name is not 
recognized, and their combinations of those 
three errors. The other two extreme errors, 
including non-name recognition for the anchor 
name, and the name is not recognized as 
potential names.
In the stage of rule-based correction, we first 
conduct word segmentation for the text. The 
segmentation process is also realized with the 
method of CRFs, without using dictionaries and 
other external knowledge. The detailed 
description is beyond this paper, which can be 
accessible in the paper (Lafferty, McCallum, and 
Pereira, 2001). The only thing we should note is 
that part of the error in such segmentation result 
obtained in this way can be corrected through 
the introduction of an external dictionary.
For each potential name, and we examine it 
from the following two aspects:
1) It is reasonable to use the word in a person 
name, including checking the surname and the 
character used in names;
2) The left and right borders are correct. 
Check the left and right sides of the cutting unit 
can be added to the names, including the words
used before names, the words used behind 
names and the surname and character used in 
names.
4 Clustering
4.1 Features
The clustering features we used can be divided 
into two types, one is token features, including 
word (after stop-word removal), uni-character
and bi-character, the other is topic features, 
which is topic-based distribution of global or 
window context learned by LDA (Latent 
Dirichlet Allocation) model.
4.1.1 Token-based Features
Simple token-based features are used in almost 
every disambiguation system. Here, we extract 
three kinds of tokens: words, uni-char and bi-
char occurring in a given document.
Then, each token in each feature vector is 
weighed by using a tf-idf weighting and entropy 
weighting schemes defined as follows.
tf-idf weighting:
log( )ik ik
i
N
a f
n
 <
entropy weighting:
1
1
log( 1.0) 1 log( )
log( )
N
ij ij
ik ik
j i i
f f
a f
N n n 
? ?? ?
  ? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?
?<
where is the frequency of term i in 
document k, N is the number of document in 
corpus, is the frequency of term i in corpus. 
So,
1
1
log( )
log( )
N
ij ij
j i i
f f
N n n 
? ?
? ?
? ?
?
is the average uncertainty or entropy of term i.
Entropy weighting is based on information 
theoretic ideas and is the most sophisticated
weighting scheme.
4.1.2 Features Selection
In this Section, we give a brief introduction on 
two effective unsupervised feature selection 
methods, DF and global tf-idf.
DF (Document frequency) is the number of 
documents in which a term occurs in a dataset. It 
is the simplest criterion for term selection and 
easily scales to a large dataset with linear
computation complexity. It is a simple but 
effective feature selection method for text 
categorization (Yang & Pedersen, 1997).
We introduce a new feature selection method 
called ?global tf-idf? that takes the term weight 
into account. Because DF assumes that each 
term is of same importance in different 
documents, it is easily biased by those common 
terms which have high document frequency but 
uniform distribution over different classes.
Global tf-idf is proposed to deal with this 
problem:
1
N
i ik
k
g tfidf
 
 ?
4.1.3 Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
Our work is related to Latent Dirichlet 
Allocation (LDA, Blei et al 2003), a 
probabilistic generative model of text generation. 
LDA models each document using a mixture 
over K topics, which are in turn characterized as 
distributions over words. The main motivation is 
that the task, fail to achieve high accuracy due to 
the data sparseness.
LDA is a generative graphical model as 
shown in Figure 1. It can be used to model and 
discover underlying topic structures of any kind 
of discrete data in which text is a typical 
example. LDA was developed based on an 
assumption of document generation process 
depicted in both Figure 1 and Table 1.
Figure 1 Generation Process for LDA
4.1.4 LDA Estimation with Gibbs Sampling
Estimating parameters for LDA by directly and 
exactly maximizing the likelihood of the whole 
data collection is intractable. The solution to this 
is to use approximate estimation methods like 
Gibbs Sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).
Here, we only show the most important 
formula that is used for topic sampling for words.
$IWHUILQLVKLQJ*LEEV6DPSOLQJWZRPDWULFHV?
DQG?DUH computed as follows.
where ? is the latent topic distribution 
corresponding to real world people.
4.1.5 Topic-based Features
Through the observation for the given corpus, 
many key information, like occupation,
affiliation, mentor, location, and so on, in many 
cases, around the target name. So, both local and 
global context are choose to doing topic analysis.
Finally, the latent topic distributions are topic-
based representation of context.
4.2 Clustering
Our system trusts the result of Person Name
detection absolutely, so contexts need to do 
clustering only if they refer to persons with the 
same name. We experimented with two different 
classical clustering methods: HAC and 
DBSCAN.
4.2.1 HAC
At the heart of hierarchical clustering lies the 
definition of similarity between clusters, which 
based on similarity between individual 
documents. In my system, a linear combination 
of similarity based on both local and global 
context is employed:
(1 )global localsim sim simD D ?  
where, the general similarity between two 
features-vector of documents di and dj is 
defined as the cosine similarity:
( , ) i ji j
i j
d d
sim d d
d d
 
<
We will now refine this algorithm for the 
different similarity measures of single-link,
complete-link, group-average and centroid 
clustering when clustering two smaller clusters 
together. In our approach we used an overall
similarity stopping threshold.
4.2.2 DBSCAN
In this section, we present the algorithm 
DBSCAN (Density Based Spatial Clustering of 
Applications with Noise) (Ester et al, 1996) 
(Table 2) which is designed to discover the 
clusters and the noise in a spatial database.
Table 2 Algorithm of DBSCAN
Arbitrary select a point p
Retrieve all points density-reachable from p wrt
Eps and MinPts.
If p is a core point, a cluster is formed.
If p is a border point, no points are density-
reachable from p and DBSCAN visits the 
next point of the database.
Continue the process until all of the points
5 Experiments and Results Analysis
We run all experiments on SIGHAN 2010 
training and test corpus. 
5.1 Preprocessing and Person Name 
Recognition
Firstly, a word segmentation tool based on CRF 
is used in each document. Then, person name 
recognition is processing. The training data for
word segmentation and PNR is People's Daily in 
January, 1998 and the whole 2000, respectively.
5.2 Feature Space
Our experiments used five types of feature (uni-
char, bi-char, word and topic in local and global), 
two feature weighting methods (tf-idf and 
entropy) and two feature selection methods (DF 
and global tf-idf).
5.3 Model Selection in LDA
Our model is conditioned on the Dirichlet 
hyperparameters D andE , the number of topic
K and iterations. The value for the D was set to 
0.2, which was optimized in tuning experiment 
used training datasets. The E was set to 0.1,
which is often considered optimal in LDA-
related models (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004). 
The K was set to 200. The Gibbs sampler was 
run for 1,000 iterations.
5.4 Clustering Results and Analysis
Since the parameter setting for the clustering 
system is very important, we focus only on the 
B-cubed scoring (Artiles et al, 2009), and 
acquire an overall optimal fixed stop-threshold 
from the training data, and then use it in test data. 
In this section, we report our results evaluated 
by the clustering scoring provided by SIGNAN 
2010 evaluation, which includes both the B-
cubed scoring and the purity-based scoring.
Table 3 and 4 demonstrate the performance (F 
scores) of our system in different features 
representation and clustering for the training 
data of the SIGNAN 2010. In Table 3, the 
numbers in parentheses are MinPts and Eps 
respectively, and stop-threshold in Table 4. As 
shown in Table 3, DBSCAN isn?t suitable for 
this task, and the results are very sensitive to
parameters. So we didn?t submit DBSCAN-
based results.
Table 4 shows that the best averaged F-scores
for PND are based on topic model, which meet 
our initial assumptions, and result based on 
merging local and global information is a bit 
better than both local and global information
independently. Also, the results based on topic 
model are the most robust because the F-score of 
variation is slightly with stop-threshold changing.
Conversely, the results based on token are not 
like this. As the performance of segmentation is 
not very satisfactory, results based on word are 
worst, even worse than uni-char-based. In 
addition, it is found that global tf-idf is better 
than DF, which is the simplest unsupervised 
feature selection method. Entropy weighting is
more effective than tf-idf weighting.
Table 5 shows that the evaluation results in 
test data on SIGHAN 2010, and the last two 
lines are results in diagnosis test. We are in fifth 
place. The evaluation results (F-score) of Person 
Name Recognition in training data is 0.965.

6 Discussion and Future Work
In this paper, we present implementation of our 
systems for SIGHAN-2010 PND bekeoff,.The 
experiments show that the topic features learned 
by LDA outperform token features and exhibit 
good robustness.
However, in our system, only given data is 
exploited. We are going to collect a very large 
external data as universal dataset to train topic 
model, and then do clustering on both a small set 
of training data and a rich set of hidden topics 
discovered from universal dataset. The universal 
dataset can be snippets returned by search 
engine or Wikipedia queried by target name and 
some keywords, and so on.
We built our PDN system on the result of 
person name recognition. However, it is not 
appropriate to toally trust the result of Person 
Name detection. So an algorithm that can correct 
NER mistakes should be investigated in future 
work..
Moreover, Cluster Ensemble system can 
ensure the result to be more robust and accurate 
accordingly, which is another direction of future 
work..
