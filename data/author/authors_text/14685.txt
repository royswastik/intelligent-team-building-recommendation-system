Abstract 
This paper presents the Chinese word 
sense Induction system of Leshan 
Teachers? College. The system 
participates in the Chinese word sense 
Induction of task 4 in Back offs 
organized by the Chinese Information 
Processing Society of China (CIPS) and 
SIGHAN. The system extracts neighbor 
words and their POSs centered in the 
target words and selected the best one of 
four cluster algorithms: Simple KMeans, 
EM, Farthest First and Hierarchical 
Cluster based on training data. We 
obtained the F-Score of 60.5% on the 
training data otherwise the F-Score is 
57.89% on the test data provided by 
organizers. 
1. Introduction 
Automatically obtain the intended sense of 
polysemous words according to its context has 
been shown to improve performance in 
information retrieval? information extraction 
and machine translation. There are two ways to 
resolve this problem in view of machine 
learning, one is supervised classification and 
the other is unsupervised classification i.e. 
clustering. The former is word sense 
disambiguation (WSD) which relies on large 
scale, high quality manually annotated sense 
corpus, but building a sense-annotated corpus 
is a time-consuming and expensive project. 
Even the corpus were constructed, the system 
trained from this corpus show the low 
performance on different domain test corpus. 
The later is word sense induction (WSI) which 
needs not any training data, and it has become 
one of the most important topics in current 
computational linguistics. 
Chinese Information Processing Society of 
China (CIPS) and SIGHAN organized a task is 
intended to promote the research on Chinese 
WSI. We built a WSI system named 
LSTC-WSI system for this task. This system 
tried four cluster algorithms, i.e.  Simple 
KMeans?EM?Farthest First and Hierarchical 
Cluster implemented by weak 3.7.1 [6], and 
found Simple KMeans compete the other three 
ones according to their performances on 
training data. Finally, the results returned by 
Simple KMeans were submitted.  
2. Features Selection 
Following the feature selection in word sense 
disambiguation, we extract neighbor words and 
their POSs centered in the target words. Word 
segmented and POS-tag tool adapted Chinese 
Lexical Analysis System developed by Institute 
of Computing Technology. No other resource is 
used in the system. The window size of the 
context is set to 5 around the ambiguous word. 
The neighbor words which occur only once 
were removed. Each sample is represented as a 
vector, and feature form is binary: if it occurs 
in is 1 otherwise is 0. 
3. Clusters Algorithms 
Four cluster algorithms were tried in our 
system. I will introduce them simply in the 
next respectively. 
K-means clustering [1] is one of the simplest 
unsupervised learning algorithms that solve the 
well known clustering problem. The main idea 
is to define k centroids, one for each cluster. 
These centroids should be placed in a cunning 
way because of different location causes 
different result. So, the better choice is to place 
them as much as possible far away from each 
other. 
EM algorithm[2] is a method for finding 
maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in 
statistical models, where the model depends on 
unobserved latent variables. EM is an iterative 
method which alternates between performing 
an expectation (E) step, which computes the 
expectation of the log-likelihood evaluated 
using the current estimate for the latent 
variables, and maximization (M) step, which 
computes parameters maximizing the expected 
log-likelihood found on the E step. 
The Farthest First algorithm [3] is an 
implementation of the ?Farthest First Traversal 
Algorithm? by Hochbaum and Shmoys (1985). 
It finds fast, approximate clusters and may be 
useful as an initialiser for k-means.  
A hierarchical clustering [4] is the guarantee 
that for every k, the induced k clustering has 
cost at most eight times that of the optimal 
k-clustering. A hierarchical clustering of n data 
points is a recursive partitioning of the data 
into 2, 3, 4, . . . and finally n, clusters. Each 
intermediate clustering is made more 
fine-grained by dividing one of its clusters. 
4. Development 
4.1 Evaluation method 
We consider the gold standard as a solution to 
the clustering problem. All examples tagged 
with a given sense in the gold standard form a 
class. For the system output, the clusters are 
formed by instances assigned to the same sense 
tag. We will compare clusters output by the 
system with the classes in the gold standard 
and compute F-score as usual [5]. F-score is 
computed with the formula below.  
Suppose  is a class of the gold standard, 
and

will be required to induce the senses of the 
target word using only the dataset provided by 
the organizers.

4.2 Data Set 
The organizers provide 50 Chinese training 
data of SIGHAN2010-WSI-SampleData. The 
training data contain 50 Chinese words; each 
word has 50 example sentences, and gives each 
word the total number of sense. The total 
number of sense is ranging from 2 to 21, but 
more cases are 2. In order to facilitate the team 
participating in the contest to do experiment, 
the organizers also provide answer to each 
word. 
In order to evaluating the system?s 
performance of all participating team, the 
organizers provide 100 test word and each 
word have 50 example sentences, the system of 
each participating team need to run out the 
results which the organizers need. 
4.3  System Setup 
We developed the LSTC-WSI system based on 
Weka. Firstly, we implemented the evaluation 
algorithm described in section 4.1. Then, the 
instances were represented as vectors according 
to the feature selection. Thirdly, four cluster 
algorithms from Weka were tried and set 
different thresholds for feature frequency. 
Because of paper length constraints, we could 
not list all the experience data we get. Table 1 
listed system performance when frequency 
threshold set two and without POS 
information.

We tried two ways for feature selection: the 
frequency of features and neighbor words? POS 
were taken into account or not. Table 2 shows 
the average performance on the test data via 
varying the parameter setting. Observing the 
results returned by Hierarchical cluster is very 
imbalance, we set the options ?-L WARD? in 
order to balance the number.

Compared with the average performance of the 
50 test data, we find the performance is best1 
when considering word only and setting the 
frequency is two at the same time simple 
KMeans was adapted. So, we use the same 
parameters setting and clustered the test data 
by simple KMeans. As table 2 shows, the 
F-Score is 60.5% on training data. But on test 
data, our system?s F-Score is 57.89% officially 
evaluated by task organizers. 
5. Conclusion and Future Works 
Four cluster algorithms are tried for Chinese 
word sense induction: Simple KMeans, EM, 
                                                        
1 Although ?Farthest First? got the highest score, the 
results of ?Farthest First? are too imbalance.  
Farthest First and Hierarchical Cluster. We 
construct different feature spaces and select out 
the best combination of cluster and feature 
space. Finally, we apply the best system to the 
test data. 
In the future, we will look for better cluster 
algorithms for word sense induction. 
Furthermore, we observe that it is different 
from word sense disambiguation, different part 
of speech will cause the polysemy. We will 
make use of this character to improve our 
system.
