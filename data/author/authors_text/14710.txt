Abstract 
The study on Automatic Recognizing 
usages of Modern Chinese Adverbs 
is one of the important parts of the 
NLP-oriented research of Chinese 
Functional words Knowledge Base. 
To solve the problems of the existing 
rule-based method of adverbs? usages 
recognition based on the previous 
work, this paper has studied auto-
matically recognizing common Chi-
nese adverbs? usages using statistical 
methods. Three statistical models, viz. 
CRF, ME, and SVM, are used to la-
bel several common Chinese ad-
verbs? usages on the segmentation 
and part-of-speech tagged corpus of 
People?s Daily(Jan 1998). The ex-
periment results show that statistical-
based method is effective in auto-
matically recognizing of several 
common adverbs? usages and has 
good application prospects. 
1 Introduction 
Chinese vocabulary can be divided into func-
tional words and notional words. In  the field 
of Natural Language Processing(NLP), many 
studies on text computing or word meaning 
understanding are focused on the notional 
words, rarely involving functional words. 
Especially in some common NLP application 
fields, such as text summarization, text clas-
sification, information retrieval, and so on, 
the researchers mainly take notional words as 
features, and list some functional word as 
stop words without considering their influ-
ence on text meaning. This will impact the 
deep analysis of text semantic, especailly for 
chinese, and become the bottleneck of ma-
chine understanding on text content, and im-
pede further improving the performance of 
application systems. Due to Chinese lacking 
morphological changes(Li X., 2005), Chi-
nese functional words undertake the gram-
matical functions and grammatical meanings, 
and in other language these functions are 
mainly undertaken by morphological 
changes. So, functional words play an more 
important role in Chinese semantic under-
standing and grammatical analysis. The 
study on functional words of modern Chi-
nese semantic in Chinese text processing and 
understanding has great significance. 
Yu(Yu S., 2004), Liu(Liu, Y., 2004), et al 
have defined the generalized functional 
words as adverbs, conjunctions, prepositions, 
modal particles, auxiliary, and localizer 
words. From the statistic, the number of 
modern Chinese adverbs is about 1000 with 
the broad definition standard. Compared with 
other fuctional words, the adverbs number is 
much larger. The function and usages of 
modern Chinese adverbs vary widely from 
each other, especially some common adverbs. 
Therefore for modern Chinese text under-
standing, adverbs are the important text fea-
tures which can not be neglected. For the 
modern Chinese adverbs, only using the 
segmentation and part-of-speech tagging in-
formation for Chinese text automatic proc-
essing and understanding is not enough. So, 
particular study on the usage of adverbs in 
texts comprehensive is indispensable, and the 
automatic identification of adverbs? usage in 
some extend is of great significance. 
2 Related Researches 
The work of automatically recognizing us-
ages of adverbs of modern Chinese is part of 
the NLP-oriented research of Modern Chi-
nese Functional Words Knowledge Base. Yu 
et al proposed the idea of building the ?Trin-
ity? knowledge-base of generalized func-
tional words(Yu, S., 2004), and defined the 
generalized functional words as adverbs, 
conjunctions, prepositions, modal particles, 
auxiliary, and localizer words(Yu, S., 
2004)(Liu, Y., 2004). Zan et al described 
adverb?s usages using formal rules(Zan, H., 
2007a), and initially built the machine-
oriented modern Chinese adverb dictionary 
and the usage rule base(Zan, H., 2007b),. 
Hao et al imported the dictionary and rule 
base(Hao, L., 2007). Based on the previous 
work, Liu et al realized an automatically 
rule-based recognizing system and got preci-
sion at 74.89%(Liu, R., 2008). 
The rule-based method has the advantage 
of simple, intuitive, strong pertinence, etc, 
but it also has the shortcomings of lower 
coverage, and it is difficult to be further op-
timized or generalized. For example, there 
are some adverbs which different usages are 
difficult to describe using formal rules, such 
as: 
?1??????????????? 
[(1)It is Sunday, you can sleep in at 
will.] 
?2??????????????????
?????? 
[(2)They were always talking while lis-
tensing report, so they catched nothing 
of the report content.] 
 
In the adverb usage dictionary, the adverb 
?jinguan??/ ? has two meanings: 
<d_jin3guan3_1> and <d_jin3guan3_2>. 
The meaning of ?jinguan??/ ? in sentence 
(1) is belong to <d_jin3guan3_1>, it means 
the action or behavior can be without any 
limitations; the meaning of ?jinguan??/ ? 
in sentence (2) is belong to <d_jin3guan3_2>, 
it means the action or behavior is continu-
ously. This two meanings are very easy to 
distinguish manually, but they are hard to 
identify automatically. The two meanings? 
discrimination cannot accurately describe 
using formal rules. 
Moreover, the rule-based method also ex-
ists some other problem, for example, some 
adverbs? usages require modifying verb 
phrase, or clauses, or used in imperative, and 
so on. These problems need deep syntactic 
even semantic knowledge to solve. But this 
is lack in the segmentation and part-of-
speech tagging corpus. So, the rule-based 
method will be unable to identify the ad-
verbs? usages in such situations. 
To solve the problems of the existing rule-
based method of adverbs? usages recognition, 
based on the foundation of the previous work, 
this article considers using statistical method 
to recognize adverbs? usages automatically. 
This method can be continuously optimized 
according to actual training data and lan-
guage model, it will avoid the limitations of 
rule-based method. 
3 Studies on Automatic Recognition 
of Adverbs? Usages Based on Sta-
tistical methods 
In NLP, the research can be divided into 
three questions: point, sequence, and struc-
ture(Vapnik V., 1998). For the Chinese ad-
verbs? usages recognition task, it can be 
taken as a point question which classify the 
context of adverbs, and also can be taken as a 
sequence question which recognize the ad-
verb sequence in the sentence. So, we choose 
three statistical models: Conditional Random 
Fields(CRF), Maximum Entropy(ME), and 
Support Vector Machine(SVM), which have 
good performance and used widely in the 
field of machine learning. CRF and ME 
model can be used in sequence tagging, and 
SVM is a better statistical models in catego-
ries.  
3.1 Statistical models 
CRF is advanced by J. Lafferty(Lafferty J., 
2001). It is one of the undirected graph mod-
els. Given input sequence corresponding 
conditional probability of label sequence, 
this model?s training target is to find the 
maximum of conditional probability. It has 
been widely used in the field of NLP, such as 
Chinese Word Segmentation(Miao X., 2007), 
Named Entity Recognition(Chen W., 
2006)(Shi S., 2006)(Guo J., 2007)(Zhang J., 
2006), Syntactic Analysis(Fei Sha, 2003), 
and so on. 
ME has been widely used for classifica-
tion problem. The basic idea of ME is to dig 
the potential constraint conditions in the 
known event sets, and then choose a model 
which must satisfy the known constraint 
conditions, while possibly let the unknown 
event uniform distribution. In the NLP appli-
cations, the language model based ME does 
not dependent on domain knowledge, and is 
independent of the specific task. It has been 
use in many key fields of NLP, and has 
achieved good results in Named Entity Rec-
ognition(Wang J., 2005), POS tag-
ging(Zhang L., 2008), Chunking Analy-
sis?Li S., 2003?, Text Emotional Tenden-
cies Classification(Liu, K. 2008). 
SVM is a statiscal machine learning 
method and has good performance in classi-
fication(Vapnik V., 1998). In NLP, SVM is 
widely used in Phrases recognition(Li, G., 
2005), Word Sense Disambiguation(Yu, K., 
2005)(Lu, Z., 2006), Text classification, and 
so on. SVM has good generalization ability, 
and can well classify the data in the training 
sample limited circumstances. To the usage 
recognition of adverbs, the available data is 
limited, so using SVM may be good. 
CRF, ME and SVM are the outstanding 
statistical models in machine learning. CRF 
can well consider the mutual influence be-
tween usage marks, and overcomes the prob-
lem of marker offset. This is good for some 
rare usage recognition of adverb. The lan-
guage model built by ME method is inde-
pendent to specific tasks, and domain knowl-
edge. ME can effectively use context infor-
mation, and comprehensively evaluate the 
various characteristics. SVM has good gen-
eralization ability, and can well classify the 
data in the training sample limited circum-
stances. The advantages of these models are 
beneficial to recognize adverbs? usages cor-
rectly. 
In this paper, we use CRF++

experiments. 
3.2 Feature Selection of Models 
Linguists Firth once said ?You shall know a 
word by the company it keeps?(Firth, 1957). 
This refers to the mean of a word can only be

judged and identified from the words associ-
ated with it. To the adverbs? usage recogni-
tion, it also needs to get the word?s usage 
knowledge from the contexts. Through ana-
lyzing some examples, we found that words 
and part of speech in the contexts are useful 
to identify adverbs? usages. Therefore, in our 
experiment, to CRF and ME model, we se-
lect 3 template features as table 1. The value 
of n can take 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

text window n 
T3 the words + part of speech + the combina-
tion of both, within the destined context

In the SVM experiment, the feature is nu-
meric characteristics. To the adverb in the 
sentence, through selecting the window size 
of the context, and then calculating the mu-
tual information(MI) of the features in the 
window and the adverb, the result of MI as 
feature vector. The MI between word w and 
word u can be calculated as follows,

4 Experiments and Results Analysis 
4.1 Experimental Corpus 
The experimental data is the segmentation 
and part-of-speech tagged corpus of People's 
Daily(Jan 1998). First, we use the rule-based 
method(Liu, R., 2008) to tag the adverbs? 
usages in the experimental data. Then, we 
manually check the tagging results and get 
he standard corpus for experiment data. Ob-
serving the experiment data, the usage distri-
bution of many adverbs? is very imbalance. 
Some adverbs have hardly appeared, and 
some usages of some adverbs have hardly 
appeared. If we choose this kind of adverbs 
for statistical experiment, it will bring great 
effect to the experiment results. Therefore, 
after analyzing the corpus, we consider to 
choose seven common Chinese adverbs 
which usage distribution is somewhat bal-
anced in the corpus as the object of statistical 
learning. 
4.2 Performance Evaluation 
In the experiment, we use the precision(P) as 
the evaluation measure of the experimental 
results. To the word W and its usage i, we 
define P as followed: 
iusageofnumbertagthe
iusageofnumbertagcorrectthe
P =
   (2) 
4.3 Analysis of Experimental Results 
In order to verify the performance of models, 
to every adverb, we use 4 fold cross-
validation experiments. The results are the 
average results of cross-validation. 
 
Experiment 1: Performance comparison ex-
periment of Statistical methods and rule 
method 
Aiming at the different statistical models, 
by selecting different feature, we did 3 
groups experimental separately. For CRF and 
ME, we select T1 while n=2. To SVM we 
take MI as feature while the window size is 2. 
Results are shown in Table 2.

method and the statistic-based method

average 
precision  
0.55 0.729 0.66 0.885 
 
From Table 2 we can see that the statistic-
based results are better than the rule-based 
results on the whole. The average precision 
has been raised from 55% to 88.5%. It can 
clearly be seen that the statistical method has 
better adaptability and good application 
prospect in automatic identification of mod-
ern Chinese adverbs? usages. 
At the same time, we can see that the sta-
tistical result of adverb ?xian ??hou/ ? is 
obviously lower than the rule-based method. 
This is because the different usage of it can 
be easily distinguished from its rule, so the 
precision of rule-based method is higher than 
statistic-based method. To these words, we 
consider to use the method that combines the 
statistics-based and rules-based method. 
 
Experiment 2: Statistical experiment under 
different feature template 
By choosing different feature templates, 
this experiment to analyze the influence of 
different feature to the statistical method. 
Figure 1 is the average results of 6 ad-
verbs(removing adverb ? ??xian hou/ ?) 
using three models. The abscissa 1-6 is the 
feature in the template T1 while n take 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7 separately. Figure 2 is the average 
results of these adverbs using CRF and ME 
with template T1, T2, and T3(see Table 1). 
The abscissa 1-3, 4-6, 7-9 ,10-12, 13-15, 16-
18, is T1, T2, T3 while n take 2, 3 ,4 ,5, 6, 7. 
From Figure 1 and Figure 2, we can see 
that the precision of statistical results have 
not great changes by choosing different con-
text window. In general it can be achieved 
the best result within the window size (-4, +4) 
of the context. So, in the current scale of 
corpus, big window size may be not better 
when recognizing usages of adverbs, and it 
may bring more noise for recognizing with 
the increase of window size. But observing 
experimental results of specific words, we 
found that it?s not all of the words exist this 
phenomenon. Figure 3 and Figure 4 is the 
result of adverb ? ?jiu/ ? and ? ?bian/ ? using 
three models with T1(n=2,?,7). 
From Figure 3 and Figure 4, we can see 
that to different adverbs, the results of three 
models are not same, and even have big dif-
ference. To adverb ??jiu/ ?, CRF is the best, 
SVM is the worst. To adverb ?bian/??, 
SVM is the best, and the difference between 
CRF and ME is not very large. (Ma Z., 2004) 
also pointed out that every adverb needs to 
be synthetically analyzed and researched.

So, to different adverb, we may be select 
different statistical model based on its own 
characteristics. For some common Chinese 
adverb, it?s very important to study and con-
trast case-by-case. 
5 Conclusions 
The article makes a preliminary study on 
automatically recognizing common adverbs? 
usages. From the experimental results wen 
can see, compared with the rule-based 
method, statistic-based method has obvious 
advantages.  
This article is a continuation of the work 
of Functional Word Knowledge Base. Fur-
thermore, we will study the method that 
combines the rule-based method and the 
statistic-based method to automatically rec-
ognizing adverbs? usages, and further en-
hance the recognition precision. We hope 
our study can help the Chinese lexical se-
mantic analysis, and make a good base to 
the Chinese text machine understanding and 
the application of natural language process-
ing.
