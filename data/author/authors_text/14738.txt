Abstract
Active learning has proven to be a successful
strategy in quick development of corpora to be
used in training of statistical natural language
parsers. A vast majority of studies in this
field has focused on estimating informative-
ness of samples; however, representativeness
of samples is another important criterion to be
considered in active learning. We present a
novel metric for estimating representativeness
of sentences, based on a modification of Zipf?s
Principle of Least Effort. Experiments on
WSJ corpus with a wide-coverage parser show
that our method performs always at least as
good as and generally significantly better than
alternative representativeness-based methods.
1 Introduction
Wide coverage statistical parsers (Collins, 1997;
Charniak, 2000) have proven to require large
amounts of manually annotated data for training to
achieve substantial performance. However, build-
ing such large annotated corpora is very expensive
in terms of human effort, time and cost (Marcus et
al., 1993). Several alternatives of the standard super-
vised learning setting have been proposed to reduce
the annotation costs, one of which is active learning.
Active learning setting allows the learner to select its
own samples to be labeled and added to the training
data iteratively. The motive behind active learning
?Vast majority of this work was done while the author was a
graduate student in Middle East Technical University, under the
funding from T ?UB?ITAK-B?IDEB through 2210 National Schol-
arship Programme for MSc Students.
is that if the learner may select highly informative
samples, it can eliminate the redundancy generally
found in random data; however, informative sam-
ples can be very untypical (Tang et al, 2002). Un-
like random sampling, active learning has no guar-
antee of selecting representative samples and untyp-
ical training samples are expected to degrade test
performance of a classifier.
To get around this problem, several methods of
estimating representativeness of a sample have been
introduced. In this study, we propose a novel rep-
resentativeness estimator for a sentence, which is
based on a modification of Zipf?s Principle of Least
Effort (Zipf, 1949), theoretically sound and em-
pirically validated on Brown corpus (Francis and
Kuc?era, 1967). Experiments conducted with a wide
coverage CCG parser (Clark and Curran, 2004;
Clark and Curran, 2007) on CCGbank (Hocken-
maier and Steedman, 2005) show that using our esti-
mator as a representativeness metric never performs
worse than and generally outperforms length bal-
anced sampling (Becker and Osborne, 2005), which
is another representativeness based active learn-
ing method, and pure informativeness based active
learning.
2 Related Work
In selective sampling setting, there are three criteria
to be considered while choosing a sample to add to
the training data (Dan, 2004; Tang et al, 2002): In-
formativeness (what will the expected contribution
of this sample to the current model be?), represen-
tativeness (what is the estimated probability of see-
ing this sample in the target population?) and diver-
249
sity (how different are the samples in a batch from
each other?). The last criterion applies only to the
batch-mode setting, in which the training data is in-
cremented by multiple samples at each step for prac-
tical purposes.
Most of the active learning research in statistical
parser training domain has focused on informative-
ness measures developed for both single and multi-
learner settings. The informativeness measures for
single-learners that have exhibited significant per-
formance in well known experimental domains are
as follow: Selecting the sentences unparsable by the
current model (and if the batch does not get filled,
using a secondary method) (Thompson et al, 1999);
selecting the sentences with the highest tree entropy,
i.e. the Shannon entropy of parses the probabilistic
parser assigns to the sentence (Hwa, 2004); select-
ing the sentences having lowest best probabilities,
where best probability is the conditional probability
of the most probable parse, given the sentence and
the current model (Osborne and Baldridge, 2004);
primarily selecting the sentences that are expected
to include events observed with low frequency so
far with the help of bagging and filling the rest of
the batch according to tree entropy, which is named
as two-stage active learning by Becker and Os-
borne (2005). Proposed informativeness measures
for multiple learners and ensemble learners can be
found in (Baldridge and Osborne, 2003; Osborne
and Baldridge, 2004; Becker and Osborne, 2005;
Baldridge and Osborne, 2008).
As for representativeness measures, Tang et.
al. (2002) proposed using sample density, i.e. the
inverse of the average distance of the sample to the
other samples in the pool, according to some dis-
tance metric. Becker and Osborne (2005) introduced
length balanced sampling, in which the length his-
togram of the batch is kept equal to the length his-
togram of a random sample of batch size drawn from
the pool.
3 Description Of The Work
We introduce a novel representativeness measure for
statistical parser training domain. Our measure is a
function proposed in (Sigurd et al, 2004), which es-
timates the relative frequencies of sentence lengths
in a natural language. Sigurd et. al. (2004) claimed
that the longer a sentence is, the less likely it will be
uttered; in accordance with Zipf?s Principle of Least
Effort (Zipf, 1935). However, too short sentences
will appear infrequently as well, since the number
of different statements that may be expressed using
relatively fewer words is relatively smaller. Authors
conjectured that there is a clash of expressivity and
effort over the frequency of sentence length, which
effort eventually wins. They formulated this behav-
ior with a Gamma distribution estimating the relative
frequencies of sentence lengths. Authors conducted
a parameter fit study for English using Brown cor-
pus (Francis and Kuc?era, 1967) and reported that the
formula f(L) = 1.1 ? L1 ? 0.90L, where L is the
sentence length, fits to the observations with very
high correlation.
We propose using this fitted formula (named
fzipf?eng from now on) as the measure of repre-
sentativeness of a sentence. This metric has sev-
eral nice features: It is model-independent (so it is
not affected from modeling errors), is both theoreti-
cally sound and empirically validated, can be used in
other NLP domains and is a numerical metric, pro-
viding flexibility in combining it with informative-
ness (and diversity) measures.
4 Experiments
4.1 Experimental Setup
We conducted experiments on CCGbank cor-
pus (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2005) with the
wide coverage CCG parser of Clark and Cur-
ran (2004; 2007)1. C&C parser was fast enough to
enable us to use the whole available training data
pool for sample selection in experiments, but not for
training (since training C&C parser is not that fast).
Among the models implemented in the parser, the
normal-form model is used. We used the default set-
tings of the C&C parser distribution for fair evalu-
ation. WSJ Sections 02-21 (39604 sentences) are
used for training and WSJ Section 23 (2407 sen-
tences) is used for testing. Following (Clark and
Curran, 2007), we evaluated the parser performance
using the labeled f-score of the predicate-argument
dependencies produced by the parser.
1Following (Baldridge and Osborne, 2004), we claim that
the performances of AL with C&C parser and other state-of-
the-art wide coverage parsers will be similar

includes the representativeness measure used. The column with the label random always includes the results for
random sampling. The numbers in parentheses are the labeled f-score values reached by the schemes.
For each active learning scheme and random sam-
pling, the size of the seed training set is 500 sen-
tences, the batch size is 100 sentences and itera-
tion stops after reaching 2000 sentences.2 For sta-
tistical significance, each experiment is replicated 5
times. We evaluate the active learning performance
in terms of Percentage Reduction in Utilized Data,
i.e. how many percents less data is used by AL
compared to random sampling, in order to reach a
certain performance score. Amount of used data is
measured with the number of brackets in the data. In
CCGbank, a bracket alays corresponds to a parse
decision, so it is a reasonable approximation of the
amount of annotator effort.
Our measure is compared to length balanced sam-
pling and using no representativeness measures.
Since there is not a trivial distance metric between
CCG parses and we do not know a proposed one, we
could not test it against sample density method. We
limited the informativeness measures to be tested
to the four single-learner measures we mentioned
in Section 2. Multi-learner and ensemble methods
are excluded, since the success of such methods re-

CCG supertagger. POS-tagger is trained with the whole avail-
able pool of 39604 sentences due to sparse data problem.
lies heavily on the diversity of the available mod-
els (Baldridge and Osborne, 2004; Baldridge and
Osborne, 2008). The models in C&C parser are
not diverse enough and we left crafting such diverse
models to future work.
We combined fzipf?eng with the informativeness
measures as follow: With tree entropy, sentences
with the highest fzipf?eng(s) ? fnte(s,G) (named
fzipf?entropy(s,G)) values are selected. fnte(s,G)
is the tree entropy of the sentence s under the cur-
rent model G, normalized by the binary logarithm of
the number of parses, following (Hwa, 2004). With
lowest best probability, sentences with the high-
est fzipf?eng(s) ? (1 ? fbp(s,G)) values are se-
lected, where fbp is the best probability function
(see Section 2). With unparsed/entropy, we primar-
ily chose the unparsable sentences having highest
fzipf?eng(s) values and filled the rest of the batch
according to fzipf?entropy. With two-stage active
learning, we primarily chose sentences that can be
parsed by the full parser but not the bagged parser
and have the highest fzipf?eng(s) values, we secon-
darily chose sentences that cannot be parsed by both
parsers and have the highest fzipf?eng(s) values, the
third priority is given to sentences having highest
251
fzipf?entropy values.3 Combining length balanced
sampling with all of these informativeness measures
is straightforward. For statistical significance, a dif-
ferent random sample is used for length histogram
in each replication of experiment.
4.2 Results
Results can be seen in Figure 1 and Table 1. Due
to lack of space and similarity of the graphs of un-
parsed/entropy and LBP, we excluded the graph of
unparsed/entropy (but its results are included in Ta-
ble 1). Since observation points in different lines do
not fall on the exactly same performance level (for
exact PRUD measurement), we took the points on as
closest f-score levels as possible. With tree entropy,
Zipfian sampling performs almost as good as pure
informativeness based AL and with two-stage AL,
length balanced sampling performs almost as good
as Zipfian sampling. In all other comparisons, Zip-
fian sampling outperforms its alternatives substan-
tially.
5 Conclusion and Future Work
We introduced a representativeness measure for ac-
tive learning in statistical parser training domain,
based on an empirical sentence length frequency
model of English. Experiments on a wide cover-
age CCG parser show that this measure outperforms
the alternative measures most of the time and never
hinders. Our study can be extended via further ex-
perimentation with the methods we excluded in Sec-
tion 4.1, with other parsers, with other languages
and with other Zipfian cues of language (e.g. Zipf?s
law on word frequencies (Zipf, 1949)).
