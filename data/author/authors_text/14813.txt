Abstract
Semantic change has mostly been studied by historical linguists and typically at the scale of centuries.
Here we study semantic change at a finer-grained level, the decade, making use of recent newspaper cor-
pora. We detect semantic change candidates by observing context shifts which can be triggered by topic
salience or may be independent from it. To discriminate these phenomena with accuracy, we combine
variation filters with a series of indices which enable building a coherent and flexible semantic change
detection model. The indices include widely adaptable tools such as frequency counts, co-occurrence
patterns and networks, ranks, as well as model-specific items such as a variability and cohesion mea-
sure and graphical representations. The research uses ACOM, a co-occurrence based geometrical model,
which is an extension of the Semantic Atlas. Compared to other models of semantic representation, it
allows for extremely detailed analysis and provides insight as to how connotational drift processes unfold.
1 Introduction
Semantic change has long been analyzed and theorized upon in historical linguistics. Its abstract and
ungraspable nature made its detection a difficult task for computational semantics, despite the many tools
available from various models of lexical treatment. Most extant theories are based on manual analysis of
century long semantic drifts. From these works we inherit various typologies and repertories of causes
of change (e.g., Bloomfield (1933)). However these types of analyses may not be suited to the large scale
production of text in our societies. Not only has the quantity of produced text rocketed but its diffusion
and speed of transmission has radically increased. In this context, recent studies have yielded promising
results, showing that computational models of semantics can deal with assessed semantic change exam-
ples as well as detect candidates in corpora. Among them, some include topic salience as an index and
others do not, as they rather try to quantify semantic change with reliable measures. In an era of infor-
mation overflow, topic change takes on a new linguistic value, as it may be responsible for extremely
quick paced semantic change, which can be ephemeral or become fixed. Topic salience might as well
be a sociologically induced or press phenomenon with no semantic impact at all. However when both
topic salience and connotational drift take place, a semantic phenomenon may be at stake. Our analysis
is anchored in this process. We shall briefly introduce other approaches, explain our methods and the
structure of our detection prototype (in progress) as well as give preliminary results before concluding
with a discussion.
2 Measuring semantic change : previous work
To measure semantic change, one has to evaluate the semantics of a lexical item at a given point. To
do so, semantic similarity measures in vector spaces or geometrical spaces may be used to compare the
315
item with its own occurrences at later points. This method has been applied in Sagi et al (2009), where
semantic density was calculated as the average angle between vectors in a semantic space. The variabil-
ity of that density was observed for the same lexical item at different points in time. Density measures
were applied to a series of acknowledged semantic change cases, in the Project Gutenberg Corpus, a
historical corpus of English organized by documents. Results mostly include broadening and narrowing
cases. The same method yielded results on the difference between nominal and verbal types of change,
showing that verbs were more likely to change than nouns (Sagi (2010)).
Cook and Stevenson (2010) also used assessed cases from the historical linguistics literature. They
detected changes in the semantic orientation of words (or polarity shifts) namely amelioration and pejo-
ration. They then applied this methodology to detect possible un-assessed candidates. They used three
English corpora as corpus slices, covering approximately a four century time-span.
Volatility has also been assessed by Holz and Teresniak (2010), who adapted a measure from economet-
rics to quantify semantic change in a time sliced corpus. The volatility measure relied on the computation
of the rank series for every co-occurent term and on the coefficient of variation of all co-occurrent terms
(Holz and Teresniak (2010)). The method was applied to search words in modern corpora in German and
English (the Wortschatz and the New York Times). The strong point of this measure is that it is indepen-
dent from word frequency, however it does not provide detailed analysis about the underlying semantic
processes.
3 Methods
Of the three cited works, our approach is closer to that of Holz and Teresniak (2010) in that both
their work and ours are conducted on very recent corpora. We are currently conducting short diachrony
detection, analysis and representation on a modern press corpus in French (the newspapers Le Monde,
1997-2007). We use the ACOM model (Ji et al (2003)) an extension of the Semantic Atlas Model (Ploux
et al (2010)) that uses factor analysis to provide geometrical representations of word co-occurrence in
corpus (both models are freely available on http://dico.isc.cnrs.fr/eng/index.html).
The model relies on cliques, which are organized subsets of co-occurrent words, from which clustering
can be made. To extract co-occurrent words, we apply ACOM on a time-sliced corpus. For each slice
t, a word-association table is constructed using all headwords (see Ploux et al (2010) for a complete
methodological description). Each headword W it (1?i?N , where N is the total number of types in the
corpus slice) has children (cjs) that are arranged in descending order of co-occurrence with W it 1:
W it : c1; c2; . . . ; cn
We apply two factors to filter this table: ? where 0???1 to eliminate the rarely co-occurring children
of W in :
W it : c1; c2; . . . ; ck
where k = n? and n is the original number of children of W it , and ? where ?(0? ? ?1) to cut off rarely
co-occurring of children of cj :
(cmj : g1; g2; . . . ; gl(1?j?k; l = m?))
On the basis of that table, cliques are calculated. The notion of clique is taken from graph theory (on
graph therory see for ex. Golumbic (2004)). Mathematically, cliques are maximum connected sub-
graphs. In our case, the nodes are contexonyms. Then, correspondence factor analysis is applied (Ben-
z?cri (1980)) and the ?2 distance is calculated between pairs of cliques to obtain a multidimensional
space. A hierarchical clustering algorithm clusters cliques in thematic sets at several degrees of detail.
Clusters show broad topic shifts whereas the cliques show fine-grained sub-organisation. Therefore the
model allows for very detailed analysis as well as topical analysis. It also provides a graphic visualization
for the semantics of a word. With the time-sliced corpus, we may extract maps for each subpart of the
1Children with co-occurrences under a 10,000th of the global frequency of the headword W it are removed to reduce noise.

corpus and compare the spaces generated for the same word at different points in time, to complete the
analysis.
3.1 Structure of the detection prototype
Currently our model is structured as follows: the corpus is transformed into a time-sliced ACOM
database, with word frequencies and co-occurence frequencies. We apply an adjustable standard de-
viation filter to extract significant frequency and co-occurrence frequency variations as well as co-
occurrence network variations. (The co-occurrence window is adjustable to the sentence, paragraph
or other window sizes). If we only detect frequency variation, there is a suspicion that the headword
might undergo context variation later, but it could also be an ephemeral press or fashion phenomenon
with no semantic impact. However if we detect both significant frequency variations and co-occurrence
variations, there is a higher chance that the context variations are a reflection of semantic variation. At
this stage we apply indices based on rank variation, clique analysis and clique-term variation analysis
(described in Boussidan et al (2010)) as well as manual analysis to determine the nature of the change.
The next step to verify that the item has undergone semantic change is its stabilization over time. This
detection path highlights short diachronic change. We may also detect significant co-occurence varia-
tions with no significant headword frequency variation, in which case we may apply directly the indices
to check whether the context shifts reveal an anchored meaning shift. If the indices highlight a meaning
shift, the former is necessarily much more subtle than the short diachronic change that we detected pre-
viously. It might be the reflection of a longer term process of which the trigger might not be contained
in the given corpus.
4 Preliminary results
4.1 Testing examples
To conceive a detection model, we first conducted experiments using attested examples or using
words that we selected after manually observing that a shift was taking place. By testing these examples,
we could extract data about how the model would render them so as to use it to create detection indices
and parameters. Among these was the French word malbouffe (literally "bad grub" or "junk food"), a
neology selected from a previously established list of new dictionary entries (Martinez (2009)). The
corpus showed how the different spellings of the words alternated before yielding the current one. Anal-
ysis of the co-occurrence networks showed that one of the most important co-occurrent words, Bov?, the
name of a French political actor, had almost the same co-occurrence network as malbouffe. From this
observation and after comparing definitions and previous contexts of use, we could infer that this person
gave the word malbouffe its new meaning, by superimposing political values on it, on top of its dietetic
values. Co-occurrence networks therefore allowed us to analyse the process of meaning shift. The full
analysis of this example may be found in Boussidan et al (2009).
We also tested a more subtle connotational drift with the word mondialisation ("globalization"), which
undergoes clear contextual change in the corpus. The word first appeared in contexts defined by the
political, economical and intellectual positions it brings about, with strong co-occurrents such as d?fi
(?challenge?), progr?s (?progress") or menace (?threat?). It then drifted into a complete network of
words related to one single French political movement of anti-globalization in 2001. Therefore the use
of mondialisation gained a new connotation, whereas its synonym globalisation ("globalization") re-
mained quite neutral politically. The analysis of this example revealed that some terms were used as
pivots, providing linkage between the existing cliques and the new ones. Pivots therefore provided a
good tool to observe meaning re-organisation. The full analysis of this example may be found in Boussi-
dan et al (2010) and the corresponding dynamic representation on http://dico.isc.cnrs.fr/
en/diachro.html.
4.2 Semantic change detection
On the basis of these preliminary examples, we designed a semantic change detection prototype.
Testing examples brought to light the difficulty of discriminating press-related topic salience with no
317
semantic impact from topic salience with a semantic impact. Detection is conducted in three stages. The
first stage relies on frequency variation to extract topic variations of context in the corpus. For instance
by setting the filter to retain words for which the coefficient of variation2 is higher than 0.5, we obtain a
list of words that may be classified into three loose semantic sets and a fourth set grouping all indepen-
dent items. These semantic sets include words related to:
? war, terrorism and violence
? technology
? illness
By adjusting the settings we mayalso include more subtle topic variations if needed or conversely, looser
ones. The second stage involves co-occurrence variation so as to extract the changes in semantic networks
and thus in connation, for a lexical item. For instance, we detected that the word logiciel ("software")
underwent a frequency co-occurrence peak with libre ("free") in January 2001. The expression logiciel
libre stands for "freeware" and has been renamed gratuiciel or graticiel (a blending of gratuit, "free"
with logiciel, "software") in Quebec. We therefore detect a new compositional expression that coins a
French equivalent to the word freeware used until then.
Another example of connotational drift is the word navigation ("navigation") which is only attested
in the TLFI3 and the Dictionnaire Historique de la Langue Fran?aise (Rey et al (1998)), under the mean-
ing relating to transport, firstly on seas and rivers and then via plane or spaceship. However, between
1997 and 2001 the word takes on a new major meaning in internet search, meaning "browsing". This is
aparent when looking at the co-occurrence patterns of navigation with words related to technology and
comparing them with co-occurrences of words related to transport. The technology words show peaks
between 1997 and 2001 and then lower frequencies until 2007, whereas the transport words show stable
use all the way through the corpus. The new use of navigation, however is almost obsolete now in spoken
speech -or at least it has gone out of fashion- but the semantics of navigation have clearly integrated an
additional domain and broadened. A simple search of French results on Google provides 5,500,000 doc-
uments for navigation internet, among which are a lot of recent ones. However the meaning to search the
internet grew from the name of a specific web navigator: the Netscape Navigator which was widespread
in the 1990s but is no longer supported nowadays.
Both previous stages provide us with candidates to semantic change. The last stage is the stabilization
of a connotational drift, whether it is a broadening, a narrowing, a domain shift or other. We are currently
working on this last index. We often find that when a word undergoes semantic change, it goes through
a phase of onomasiological competition in which other possible candidates may in turn become the new
bearers of certain meanings. For navigation for instance, the word surf was a competitor, however both
words now sound obsolete. It may be that none of them wins the competition, in which case the concept
has become so deeply anchored in language and society that it does not need naming any more.
5 Discussion and Future Work
Since semantic phenomena, whether synchronic or diachronic, are very much corpus specific, it is
difficult to conceive of a large scale universal detection method for them. However, tools may be built
to be highly flexible in order to allow users to adjust settings to adapt to the corpus they deal with. This
flexibility may encompass genre and stylistic variations when working with the same language as well
as adaptation to a completely different language. We are considering global evaluations of the corpora?s
stylistics to avoid the detection of corpus specfic phenomena instead of broader language phenomena.

Ideally the model should also be able to deal with timescale differences.The precise adjustment of these
settings is part of our future research avenues along with incorporating an index for stabilization. This
last filter is particularly difficult to create when dealing with ongoing phenomena. We may sometimes
need to wait a few years to be able to establish whether a semantic change has stabilized.
To summarize, we are currently developing a filtering tool to extract candidates to semantic change on
the basis of topic salience variation in corpus and co-occurrence network variation. Our approach shed
light on the emergence of these phenomena at a very detailed level. Preliminary results showed that the
tool was succesful at extracting those candidates; however it is not yet advanced enough to discriminate
between context changes that affect a word without semantic impact and those that do have a semantic
impact. This aspect constitutes our current research perspective.
