ANGLICKY.  
The conmmnicative function of the sentence 
can basically be rendered by understanding its 
topic (T) as 'what is the sentence about', and 
its focus (F) as the information that is asserted 
about the topic, i.e., schematically, the interpre- 
tation of the sentence S can be understood as 
s - F(T) 
Thus, (1)(a) asserts, on its preferred reading 
(with just the locative modification constituting 
its focus) about where English is spoken that 
it is in the Shetlandt, which hardly can be ac- 
cepted as true w.r.t, what we know of the actual 
world, if no specific context is present. (1)(b) is 
understood as true, stating about E. that it is 
spoken in the S. 
In the TGTSs the order of nodes is such that 
all parts of T precede all parts of F. Moreover, 
the order of nodes corresponds to the scale of 
communicative dynamism (CD, see Section 3 
below); a less dynamic node prototypically has 
the broader scope than a more dynamic one (if 
the nodes correspond to operators). F proper is 
then the most dynamic (the rightmost) node. 
TFA is relevant also tbr the semantics of nega- 
tion: 
(2) John 
(a) 
(b) 
didn't come because he was ILL. 
The reason for Jolm's not-coming was 
his illness. 
The reason for John's coming (e.g. to 
the doctor) was not his illness but 
something else (e.g. he wanted to in- 
vite the doctor for a party). 
With the paraphrase (a), the negated verb 
'come' is included in T, i.e. the fact that John's 
being ill is the cause of an event is asserted about 
the event that he did not come. With (b), the 
main verb 'come' alto belongs to T, but what it 
negated, is the relation between T and F: John 
came, but what is asserted about his coming is 
that the cause of this event was not his illness 
(he might have been ill, though). 
Every node in a TGTS is either contextually 
bound (CB) or non-bound (NB); this opposi- 
tion is a linguistic couterpart of the cognitive 
dichotomy of 'given' vs. hmw', where also an 
item, if corresponding to a 'given' referent pre- 
sented as occupying a newly characterized spe- 
cific position (often in relation to one or more 
'given' items), has the feature NB, cf.: 
(3) Give th, is to YOUR mother. (My parents 
don't like s~tch gifts.) 
kno',,,s  oth ete," ,lane.) Ho,. 
ever, th.is time she only invited IIER. 
The indexical pronoun 'your' in (3) and the 
anaphoric pronoun 'her' in (4) can only rethr to 
items that in a sense are 'known' in the given 
situation. However, in these examples, both of 
them occur as NB; their stress indicates their 
flmction as F proper of the respective sentence. 
Prototypically, an NB node belongs to F and a 
CB node is in T; however, a node not dependent 
immediately on a finite verb (esp. an adjunct) 
need not meet this condition. Thus, in (5), 'my' 
as a shifter, directly determined by the condi- 
tions of the discourse, is CB, although belong- 
ing to F, since it; depends on a part of F (see 
(HajiSovi~ et al, 1998) fbr a definition of T and 
F on the basis of contextual boundness and of 
syntactic dependency, aswell as for other details 
of the given descriptive frmnework). 
2.2 The  a t t r ibute  TFA in PDT 
Three values of the attribute TFA are distin- 
guished with every node in a TGTS: 
1. T a non-contrastive CB node, which always 
has a lower degree of CD than its governor, 
if any; 
2. F an NB node (if different from the main 
verb, then following after its head word in 
the TGTS) 
3. C a contrastive CB node 
Examples: 
(5) (VoIby v Izracli.) Po volbdeh.(T) si 
IzvaeIci(T) zvykaji(F) na novdho(F) pre- 
mid,'a(F). 
(Headline in tile newspapers: Elections ill 
Israel.) After the elections(T), the It- 
raelis(T) get used(F) to a new(F) Prime 
Minister(F). 
140 
(c,) &o,.~,o,,,(,(:(c) o,,,(T).#(P) (lol,,.:,;(F), (,,~(., 
.j(,ko politik(C) v.evynikd(F). 
(As a) St)ortsman(C ) he(T) is(F) g(,od(F), 
but as a politician(C) he does not ex(:el(l?). 
The instructions for the assigmnent of the 
values of TFA can be briefly sl)e('itied as fol- 
lows, if the surface word order and the 1)osi- 
tion of the intonation center (IC, see fl)otnote

other movements are discussed in Section 
2.4: below) 
10. the nodes subor(linate to such an N move 
together with it and get T or F (according 
to the rules above) 
Note: The resulting TGTSs are projective, 
i.e. t br every pair of nodes x, y in a TGTS it 
holds that if x depends on y and x follows (pre- 
cedes) 37, then every node z following (preceding) 
y and preceding (following) x is subordinate to 
y. Thus, 'not to meet the condition of projec- 
tivity' concerns tim 'analytic' trees; this means, 
in other words, that this condition would not be 
met if the positions of x and y in the left-to-right 
order of the nodes in the TOTS (in the 'under- 
lying word order') always corresponded to their 
positions in the surface (morphemic and %na- 
lytic') word order. 
Example (with a very simplified linearized no- 
tation of the TGTS, in which every dependent 
is closed in its pair of parentheses):

2.3 The  pos i t ion  of  a restored node  
The degree of CD of a node that is being re- 
stored (i.e. supposed to have been deleted in 
the surface form of the sentence), and thus also 
its position in the underlying word order, is de- 
termined on the basis of its relationship to its 
governing node. Since such a node ahnost al- 
ways is contextually bound (with the exception 
of the specific case of coordinated structures, see 
the Note after point 8 in Section 2.2 above), it 
is placed to the left of its governing word; more 
specifically: 
(a) if the restored node RN depends on a verb, 
then: 
(b) 
(c) 
(aa) if RN is not the single item depending 
on the given verb token, then RN is 
to be added in the 'Wackernagel posi- 
tion'; 
(ab) if RN has no sister nodes, then it is 
placed at the beginning of the clause; 
if RN is restored as depending on a noun 
(or adjective), I{N is placed as the least dy- 
namic dependent of this governing word; 
if more than one node are inserted as de- 
pending on one and the same item, then 
their order should confornl to tile systemic 
(%anonical') ordering of the valency slots 
(see the remark on SO in Section 2.2 above, 
point 4). 
Point (a) appears to be substantiated by the 
fact that e.g. the subject )ronolln appears ill the 
zero form in Czech under similar conditions as 
the weak, clitic pronouns, for which the position 
imlnediately to the left of the verb is typical, cf. 
sentences such as VSera (on) p~'igel pozd5 \]Yes- 
terday (he) canto here late\], Janu (oni) nevidSli 
\[lit.: .Jane-Accus they have-not-seen\], o1"(On) 
spal \[He was-sleeping\]. This concerns also such 
deletable items as e.g. the Directional with pfi- 
jet \[arrive\], cf. Jan dnes (sere/tam) ncp~'~;jcl \[ it. 
.John to-day (he,'e/there) has-not-arrived\]. 
The appropriateness of these preliminary 
rules is being checked uring the tagging proce- 
dure, the results of which will be of importance 
for a more exact (and more complete) formula- 
tion of the relevant parts of the description of 
the sentence structure of Czech. This aspect 
142 
of the useflflness of the corpus tagging concerns 
also many ol;h(;r 1)oinl;s of grammar. 
2.4 Under ly ing  and  sur face word  order  
Within the tagging procedure, tim differences 
between the two levels of the left-to-right order 
can be described 1)y movelnent rules, a prelimi- 
nary tbrm of which can be brietly characterized 
as follows: 
1. if a node 1111 carries C and a node M2 de- 
l)ending on M1 is 1)laced to the right of a 
node M3 superordinate o M1 in the surtkce 
word order, then M1 is placed immediately 
to the left of M2 in the resulting tree; cf. 
e.g. &o,'tov~',c (M1) o,, .# (M3) dob,",'j (M2) 
Ilit. (As a) sportsman he is goodl, see ex. 
(6) in Section 2.2 
2. if the 1)ositions of the nodes MI, M2 and 
M3 differ front l)oint \] only in t;hat M1 (h> 
pends on M2, then again M1 is placed im- 
mediately to the left of M2 ill the resul/:ing 
tree; of. exanll)le (7) ill Se(:i;ion 2.2 a\])ove, 
in which jdsot  occut)ies the position of M\], 
d,ivod that of M2, and nen i  that of M3, or: 
(9) ,lirku (M1)j.sme pld 'novd i (M3)

IliL George.Ac(:us (M1) we-1)la\],ned

3. ~ compar~tive of an ~Mje(:tive thai; \])rece(les 
its governing 1).OUll in t;he surface is moved 
to the right of this noun in (,,xamt)les such as 
vdt.?i re&to nc~ 13o,s'to',, \[a. hn'ger town than 
Boston\]; I his surface order probably should 
be limited (by a rule of grammar) to cases 
in which the two nouns 1)elong to a single 
semantic sul)class. 
4. in sentences exhibiting a secondary place- 
ment of IC, the bearer of IC occupies the 
rightmost 1)osition in the resulting l:ree; cf. 
example (\])(b) in Section 2.1 al)ove, in 
whi('h 'English' is tile t bt:us prol)er; the as- 
suinl)gion underlying the. t)lacemenl; of IC 
in a written text is that g~ written form of ~ 
sentence may correspond to dit\[erent (silo- 
ken) sentences, according to the differences 
of the 1)lacement of IC in the al)l)ropriate 
way of 1)renouncing t;he sentence. 
3 The  spec ia l  case of  focus  sens i t i ve  
par t ic les  
Since the focus sensitive particles are idengified 
(1)y the flmctor value RHEM for 'rhematizer' or 
'focalizer'), it is possitfle to use PDT also for 
a sl)ecitication of their occurrences in different 
positions 1)oth in the det)endency structure of 
the sentence and in its TFA. Tile starting hy- 
l)otheses, which might be checked on the basis of 
PDT, are. as tbllows (of. (Hajieov5 ctal., 1998)): 
3.1 Focus sensit ive particles in 
i )rototypical pos i t ions 
The 1)rotol;yl)ical syntactic position of a foc, al- 
izer ca.ll t)e understood as that of a dependent 
of a verb node; thus, in examples like (10) or 
(11), it is 1)ossible to specit:y lhe scope of the 
foealizer as the whole subtree subordinated to 
lhe verl) (where "sul)ordilml;ed' is undersl;ood as 
t\]le transitive closure of klel)en(lent' in the re- 
flexive s('.nsc, so I:hat the, verl) itself is in('luded); 
the st'Ol)e is divided into 1)a(:kground and focus 
of the fl)calizer (ti:'), as will 1)e specified in 3.2. 
Thus, in the interl)retation of (10) on the read- 
ing ret)rcsented (with many siml)lifications) by 
(10') it is included that (according to what P. 
knows) among l;hose whom % saw there was 
noone else t;han M (i.e. while 'T. saw' consti- 
l;lll;es l;he 1)ackground of 'only', its fl" is 'Mary'). 
Similarly, if in (11) the negation (all;hough ex- 
\]n'css('d l)y ~t prefix in Czech) is handled as a 
det)cn(lelfl: of the \,er\]), its bad{ground is the 
subject and tt' includes 1)oth the vcrl) an(l t;he

3.2 Focus sensitive particles in the 
hierarchy of comnmnicat ive 
dynamism 
The primary position of a focalizer ill a TR is at 
the boundary between tile topic and the focus 
of the verb clause and the tbcus of tile clause is 
then identical to tile focus of tile focalizer. If a 
fbcalizer is included in the topic, then its focus 
contains those items which in the TR are placed 
between this focalizer mid the next item ularked 
as C to tile right and are nlore dynamic than the 
tbcalizer). 
It should be noted that CD is understood here 
as a partial ordering defined so that: 
(i) in every set of a head and its daughter 
nodes, every daughter node placed to the 
right of its head is more dynamic than ev- 
cry daughter node placed to the left of its 
head; 
(ii) the relation 'more dynanfic' is deternlined 
by the irrettexive trausil;ive closure of (i). 
~i'hus, e.g. in the TI{ (10'), 'knows' is more dy- 
nalnic than 'Paul' and less dynmnic than 'saw' 
according to tile point (i), and both 'only' and 
'Mary', being more dynanlic titan 'saw', are 
more dynmnie than ~knows' according to the 
point (ii); however, ~Thomas' is neither more 
nor less dynamic than 'knows'. If (10) is cut- 
bedded into a more conlplex sentence as (a part 
of) its topic, titan 'Mary' is more dynanfic thml 
%nly' and has the f~atm'e C; thus, e.g. with 
'Since Paul knows that Thomas saw only Mary, 
he is not afraid', 'Mary' constitutes the whole fl 
of 'only', similarly as in (10'). 
Tile underlying word order W (a linear order- 
ing) is then defined on the basis of CD, with (iii) 
and (iv) holding tbr every two nodes x and y in 
a tree: 
(iii) if node x is nlore dynamic than node y, then 
x tbllows y under W; 
(iv) if node x follows node y under W, node u is 
subordinated to x and node z is subordinate 
to y, then u tbllows both y and z, and x 
follows z under W. 
Among tile non-prototyt)ical , secondary posi- 
tions of tbcalizers, there are also the cases of 
their clustering (e.g. 'not only'), as well as the 
sentences in which a focalizer itself constitutes 
the whole locus of tile sentence ('He DID realize 
this'). 
4 Summary  
After a brief characterization f the Prague De- 
pendency Treebank and of tile Praguian theory 
of Topic-Focus Articulation we have presented 
a proposal how the main aspects of tile intbr- 
nlation structure of the sentence (i.e. of its 
topic-focus articulation) cml be integrated into 
the tagging system that captures the underly- 
ing structures. The present form of the system 
nmkes it possible to check our hypotheses on a 
large text corpus, and thus perhaps to achieve 
a higher degree of automation (and reliability) 
of the proposed procedure. The last section ex- 
emplifies how the t)roposed approach makes it 
possible to analyze structures with the so-called 
focus sensitive operators.
