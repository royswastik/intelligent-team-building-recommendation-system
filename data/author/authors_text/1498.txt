Abstract 
Analysis of 9000 manually written summaries of 
newswire stories used in four Document Under-
standing Conferences indicates that approximately 
40% of their lexical items do not occur in the source 
document. A further comparison of different sum-
maries of the same document shows agreement on 
28% of their vocabulary. It can be argued that these 
relationships establish a performance ceiling for 
automated summarization systems which do not 
perform syntactic and semantic analysis on the 
source document. 
 
1 Introduction 
Automatic summarization systems rely on manually 
prepared summaries for training data, heuristics and 
evaluation. Generic summaries are notoriously hard 
to standardize; biased summaries, even in a most 
restricted task or application, also tend to vary be-
tween authors. It is unrealistic to expect one perfect 
model summary, and the presence of many, poten-
tially quite diverse, models introduces considerable 
uncertainty into the summarization process. In addi-
tion, many summarization systems tacitly assume 
that model summaries are somehow close to the 
source documents. 
We investigate this assumption, and study the va-
riability of manually produced summaries. We first 
describe the collection of documents with 
summaries which has been accumulated over sev-
eral years of participation in the Document Under-
standing Conference (DUC) evaluation exercises 
sponsored by the National Institute of Science and 
Technology (NIST). We then present our methodol-
ogy, discuss the rather pessimistic results, and fi-
nally draw a few simple conclusions. 
2 The Corpus 
2.1 General Organization 
The authors have assembled a corpus of manually 
written summaries of texts from their archive of ma-
terials provided to participants in the DUC confer-
ences, held annually since 2001. It is available at the 
DUC Web site to readers who are qualified to ac-
cess the DUC document sets on application to 
NIST. To help interested parties assess it for their 
purposes we provide more detail than usual on its 
organization and contents. 
Most summaries in the corpus are abstracts, writ-
ten by human readers of the source document to best 
express its content without restriction in any manner 
save length (words or characters). One method of 
performing automatic summarization is to construct 
the desired amount of output by concatenating rep-
resentative sentences from the source document, 
which reduces the task to one of determining most 
adequately what ?representative? means. Such sum-
maries are called extracts. In 2002, recognizing that 
many participants summarize by extraction, NIST 
produced versions of documents divided into indi-
vidual sentences and asked its author volunteers to 
compose their summaries similarly. Because we use 
a sentence-extraction technique in our summariza-
tion system, this data is of particular interest to us. It 
is not included in the corpus being treated here and 
will be discussed in a separate paper. 
The DUC corpus contains 11,867 files organized 
in a three-level hierarchy of directories totalling 
62MB. The top level identifies the source year and 
exists simply to avoid the name collision which oc-
curs when different years use same-named subdirec-
tories. The middle 291 directories identify the 
document clusters; DUC reuses collections of 
newswire stories assembled for the TREC and TDT 
research in itiatives which report on a common topic 
or theme. Directories on the lowest level contain 
SGML-tagged and untagged versions of 2,781 indi-
vidual source documents, and between one and five 
summaries of each, 9,086 summaries in total. In 
most cases the document involved is just that: a sin-
gle news report originally published in a newspaper. 
552 directories, approximately 20% of the corpus, 
represent multi-document summaries?ones which 
the author has based on all the files in a cluster of 
related documents. For these summaries a source 
document against which to compare them has been 
constructed by concatenating the individual docu-
ments in a cluster into one file. Concatenation is 
done in directory order, though the order of docu-
ments does not matter here. 
2.2 The Corpus in Detail 
The Document Understanding Conference has 
evolved over the four years represented in our cor-
pus, and this is reflected in the materials which are 
available for our purposes. Table 1 classifies these 
files by year and by target size of summary; the 
rightmost column indicates the ratio of summaries 
to source documents, that is, the average number of 
summaries per document. Totals appear in bold. The 
following factors of interest can be identified in its 
data: 
? Size . Initially DUC targeted summaries of 50, 
100 and 200 words. The following year 10-word 
summaries were added, and in 2003 only 10- 
and 100-word summaries were produced; 
? Growth. Despite the high cost of producing 
manual summaries, the number of documents 
under consideration has doubled over the four 
years under study while the number of summa-
ries has tripled; 
? Ratio. On average, three manual summaries are 
available for each source document; 
? Formation. While longer summaries are rou-
tinely composed of well-formed sentences, sub-
sentential constructs such as headlines are ac-
ceptable 10-word summaries, as are lists of key 
words and phrases. 
? Author. Although the 2004 DUC source docu-
ments include machine translations of foreign 
language news stories, in each case a parallel 
human translation was available. Only source 
documents written or translated by human be-
ings appear in the corpus. 
3 The Evaluation Model 
Figure 1 shows the typical contents of a third-level 
source document directory. Relations we wish to 
investigate are marked by arrows. There are two: the 
relationship between the vocabulary used in the 
source document and summaries of it, and that 
among the vocabulary used in summaries them-
selves. The first is marked by white arrows, the sec-
ond by grey.  
The number of document-summary relations in 
the corpus is determined by the larger cardinality set 
involved, which here is the number of summaries: 
thus 9,086 instances. For every document with N 
summaries, we consider all C(N, 2) pairs of summa-
ries. In total there are 11,441 summary-summary 
relationships.  
We ask two questions: to what degree do summa-
ries use words appearing in the source document? 
and, to what degree do different summaries use the 
same vocabulary? 
3.1 Measures 
To answer our two questions we decided to compute 
statistics on two types of elements of each pair of 
test documents: their phrases, and ultimately, their

Figure 1: Files and relationships investigated 
individual tokens. Phrases were extracted by apply-
ing a 987-item stop list developed by the authors 
(Copeck and Szpakowicz 2003) to the test docu-
ments. Each collocation separated by stop words is 
taken as a phrase1. Test documents were tokenized 
by breaking the text on white space and trimming 
off punctuation external to the token. Instances of 
each sort of item were recorded in a hash table and 
written to file.  
Tokens are an obvious and unambiguous baseline 
for lexical agreement, one used by such summary 
evaluation systems as ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 
2003). On the other hand, it is important to explain 
what we mean by units we call phrases; they should 
not be confused with syntactically correct constitu-
ents such as noun phrases or verb phrases. Our units 
often are not syntactically well-formed. Adjacent 
constituents not separated by a stop word are uni-
fied, single constituents are divided on any embed-
ded stop word, and those composed entirely of stop 
words are simply missed.  
Our phrases, however, are not n-grams. A 10-
word summary has precisely 9 bigrams but, in this 
study, only 3.4 phrases on average (Table 2). On the 
continuum of grammaticality these units can thus be 
seen as lying somewhere between generated blindly 
n-grams and syntactically well-formed phrasal con-
stituents. We judge them to be weakly syntactically 
motivated2 and only roughly analogous to the fac-
toids identified by van Halteren and Teufel (2003) 
in the sense that they also express semantic con-
structs. Where van Halteren and Teufel identified 
factoids in 50 summaries, we sacrificed accuracy for 
automation in order to process 9000. 
We then assessed the degree to which a pair of 
documents for comparison shared vocabulary in 
terms of these units. This was done by counting 
matches between the phrases. Six different kinds of 
match were identified and are listed here in what we 
deem to be decreasing order of stringency. While 
the match types are labelled and described in terms 
of summary and source document for clarity, they 
apply equally to summary pairs. Candidate phrases 
are underlined and matching elements tinted in the 
examples; headings used in the results table (Table 
2) appear in SMALL CAPS. 
                                                 
1 When analysis of a summary indicated that it was a 
list of comma- or semicolon-delimited phrases, the phras-
ing provided by the summary author was adopted, includ-
ing any stopwords present. Turkey attacks Kurds in Iraq, 
warns Syria, accusations fuel tensions, Mubarak inter-
cedes is thus split into four phrases with the first retaining 
the stopword in. There are 453 such summaries. 
2 While the lexical units in question might be more ac-
curately labelled syntactically motivated ngrams, for sim-
plicity we use phrase in the discussion. 
? Exact match. The most demanding, requires 
candidates agree in all respects.  EXACT 
after Mayo Clinic stay ? 
Mayo Clinic group 
? Case-insensitive exact match relaxes the re-
quirement for agreement in case.  EXACT CI 
concerning bilateral relations ? 
Bilateral relations with 
? Head of summary phrase in document re-
quires only that the head of the candidate appear 
in the source document phrase. The head is the 
rightmost word in a phrase.  HEAD DOC 
calls Sharon disaster ? 
deemed tantamount to disaster 
? Head of document phrase in summary is the 
previous test in reverse.  HEAD SUM 
? Summary phrase is substring of document 
phrase. True if the summary phrase appears 
anywhere in the document phrase.  SUB DOC 
has identified Iraqi agent as ? 
the Iraqi agent defection 
? Document phrase is substring of summary 
phrase reverses the previous test. SUB SUM 
Tests for matches between the tokens of two 
documents are more limited because only single 
lexical items are involved. Exact match can be sup-
plemented by case insensitivity and by stemming to 
identify any common root shared by two tokens. 
The Porter stemmer was used. 
The objective of all these tests is to capture any 
sort of meaningful resemblance between the vo-
cabularies employed in two texts. Without question, 
additional measures can and should be identified 
and implemented to correct, expand, and refine the 
analysis. 
3.2 Methodology 
The study was carried out in three stages. A pre-
study determined the ?lie of the land??what the 
general character of results was likely to be, the 
most appropriate methodology to realize them, and 
so on. In particular this initial investigation alerted 
us to the fact that so few phrases in any two texts 
under study matched exactly as to provide little use-
ful data, leading us to add more relaxed measures of 
lexical agreement. This initial investigation made it 
clear that there was no point in attempting to find a 
subset of vocabulary used in a number of summa-
ries?it would be vanishingly small?and we there-
fore confined ourselves in the main study to 
pairwise comparisons. The pre-study also suggested 
that summary size would be a significant factor in 
lexical agreement while source document size 
would be less so, indications which were not en-
tirely borne out by the strength of the results ult i-
mately observed. 
The main study proceeded in two phases. After 
the corpus had been organized as described in Sec-
tion 2 and untagged versions of the source docu-
ments produced for the analysis program to work 
on, that process traversed the directory tree, decom-
posing each text file into its phrases and tokens. 
These were stored in hash tables and written to file 
to provide an audit point on the process. The hash 
tables were then used to test each pair of test docu-
ments for matches?the source document to each 
summary, and all combinations of summaries. The 
resulting counts for all comparisons together with 
other data were then written to a file with results, 
one line per source document in a comma-delimited 
format suitable for importation to a spreadsheet pro-
gram. 
The second phase of the main study involved or-
ganizing the spreadsheet data into a format permit-
ting the calculation of statistics on various cate-
gorizations of documents they describe. Because the 
source document record was variable-length in itself 
and also contained a varying number of variable-
length sub-records of document pair comparisons, 
this was a fairly time-consuming clerical task. It did 
however provide the counts and averages presented 
in Table 2 and subsequently allowed the user to re-
categorize the data fairly easily.  
A post-study was then conducted to validate the 
computation of measures by reporting these to the 
user for individual document sets, and applied to a

the comparison of two summaries of source docu-
ment AFA19981230.1000.0058. A secondary 
objective of the post-study was to inspect the ac-
tual data. Were there factors in play in the data 
that had escaped us? None were made evident be-
yond the all-too-familiar demonstration of the 
wide variety of language use in play. The log file 
of document phrase hash tables provided an addi-
tional snapshot of the kind of materials with 
which the automated computation had been work-
ing. 
4  Results 
4.1 Data Averages  
Table 2 illustrates the degree to which summaries 
in the DUC corpus employ the same vocabulary 
as the source documents on which they are based 
and the degree to which they resemble each other 
in wording. The table, actually a stack of four ta-
bles which share common headings, presents data 
on the document-summary relationship followed 
by inter-summary data, giving counts and then 
percentages for each relationship. Statistics on the 
given relationship appear in the first three col-
umns on the left; counts and averages are classi-
fied by summary size. The central group of six 
columns presents from left to right, in decreasing 
order of strictness, the average number of phrase 
matches found for the size category. The final two 
columns on the right present parallel match data 
for tokens. Thus for example the column entitled 
STEM CI shows the average number of stemmed, 
case-insensitive token matches in a pair of test 
documents of the size category indicated. Each 
table in the stack ends with a boldface row that 
averages statistics across all size categories.  
Inspection of the results in Table 2 leads to 
these general observations: 
? With the exception of 200-word summaries 
falling somewhat short (157 words), each cate-
gory approaches its target size quite closely; 
? Phrases average three tokens in length regard-
less of summary size; 
? The objective of relaxing match criteria in the 
main study was achieved. With few exceptions, 
each less strict match type produces more hits 
than its more stringent neighbors; 
? The much smaller size of the now discontinued 
50- and 200-word categories argues against in-
vesting much confidence in their data; 
? Finally, while no effect was found for source 
document size (and results for that categorization 
are therefore not presented), the percentage tables 
suggest summary size has some limited impact on 
vocabulary agreement. This effect occurs solely 
on the phrasal level, most strongly on its strictest 
measures; token values are effectively flat.  
We are uncertain why this last situation is so. 
Consider only the well-populated 10-word and 
100-word summary classes. The effect cannot be 
accounted for a preponderance of multiple -
document summaries in either class which might 
provide more opportunities for matches. Despite 
many more of these being among the 100-word 
summaries than the 10-word (1974 single : 1056 
multi, versus 116 single : 5456 multi), the per-
centage of exact phrasal matches is essentially the 
same in each subcategorization of these classes. 
We speculate that authors may compose the 
sentences in 100-word summaries in terms of 
phrases from the source document, while 10-word 
summaries, which more closely resemble terse 
headlines, cannot be composed by direct reuse of 
source document phrases. 50- and 200-word 
summaries are also composed of sentences. Their 
exact match percentages approach those of 100-
word summaries, lending support to this interpre-
tation.  
Figure 3: Percentages of summary vocabulary 
agreement for all source documents, by measure 
4.2 Data Variance 
Whether count or percentage, exclusively average 
data is presented in Table 2. While measures of 
central tendency are an important dimension of 
any population, a full statistical description also 
requires some indication of measures of variance. 
These appear in Figure 3 which shows, for each of 
the six phrasal and two token measures, what per-
centage of the total number of summaries falls 
into each tenth of the range of possible values. For 
example, a summary in which 40% of the phrases 
were exactly matched in the source document 
would be represented in the figure by the vertical 
position of the frontmost band over the extent of 
the decade labeled ?4??24%. The figure?s three-
dimensional aspect allows the viewer to track 
which decades have the greatest number of in-
stances as measures move from more strict to 
more relaxed, front to back.   
However, the most striking message communi-
cated by Figure 3 is that large numbers of summa-
ries have zero values for the stricter measures, 
EXACT, EXACT CI and PART SUM in particular and 
PART DOC to a lesser degree. These same meas-
ures have their most frequent values around the 
50% decade, with troughs both before and after. 
To understand why this is so requires some expla-
nation. Suppose a summary contains two phrases.  
If none are matched in the source its score is 0%.  
If one is matched its score is 50%; if  both, 100%.  
A summary with three phrases has four possible 
percentage values: 0%, 33%, 66% and 100%.  The 
'hump' of partial matching is thus around the fifty 
percent level because most summaries are ten 
words, and have only 1 or 2 candidates to be 
matched. The ranges involved in the stricter 
measures are not large. 
That acknowledged, we can see that the modal 
or most frequent decade does indeed tend in an 
irregular way to move from left to right, from zero 
to 100 percent, as measures become less strict. In 
making this observation, note that the two back-
most bands represent measures on tokens, a dif-
ferent syntactic element than the phrase. The 
information about the distribution of summary 
measures shown in this figure is not unexpected. 
4.3 Key Findings 
The central fact that these data communicate quite 
clearly is that summaries do not employ many of 
the same phrases their source documents do, and 
even fewer than do other summaries. In particular, 
on average only 37% of summary phrases appear 
in the source document, while summaries share 
only 9% of their phrases. This becomes more un-
derstandable when we note that on average only 
55% of the individual words used in summaries, 
both common vocabulary terms and proper names, 
appear in the source document; and between 
summaries, on average only 22% are found in 
both. 
It may be argued that the lower counts for inter-
summary vocabulary agreement can be explained 
thus: since a summary is so much smaller than its 
source document, lower counts should result. One 
reply to that argument is that, while acknowledg-
ing that synonymy, generalization and specializa-
tion would augment the values found, the essence 
of a generic summary is to report the pith, the gist, 
the central points, of a document and that these 
key elements should not vary so widely from one 
summary to the next. 
5 Pertinent Research 
Previous research addressing summary vocabulary 
is limited, and most has been undertaken in con-
nection with another issue: either with the prob-
lem of evaluating summary quality (Mani, 2001; 
Lin and Hovy, 2002) or to assess sentence element 
suitability for use in a summary (Jing and McKe-
own, 1999). In such a case results arise as a by-
product of the main line of research and conclu-
sions about vocabulary must be inferred from 
other findings.  
Mani (2001) reports that ?previous studies, most 
of which have focused on extracts, have shown 
evidence of low agreement among humans as to 
which sentences are good summary sentences.? 
Lin and Hovy?s (2002) discovery of low inter-
rater agreement in single (~40%) and multiple 
(~29%) summary evaluation may also pertain to 
our findings. It stands to reason that individua ls 
who disagree on sentence pertinence or do not rate 
the same summary highly are not likely to use the 
same words to write the summary. In the very 
overt rating situation they describe, Lin and Hovy 
were also able to identify human error and quan-
tify it as a significant factor in rater performance. 
This reality may introduce variance as a conse-
quence of suboptimal performance: a writer may 
simply fail to use the mot juste . 
In contrast, Jing, McKeown, Barzilay and Elha-
dad (1998) found human summarizers to be ?quite 
consistent? as to what should be included, a result 
they acknowledge to be ?surprisingly high?. Jing 
et al note that agreement drops off with summary 
length, that their experience is somewhat at vari-
ance with that of other researchers, and that this 
may be accounted for in part by regularity in the 
structure of the documents summarized. 
Observing that ?expert summarizers often reuse 
the text in the original document to produce a 
summary? Jing and McKeown (1999) analyzed 
300 human written summaries of news articles 
and found that ?a significant portion (78%) of 
summary sentences produced by humans are ba-
sed on cut-and-paste?, where ?cut-and-paste? indi-
cates vocabulary agreement. This suggests that 
22% of summary sentences are not produced in 
this way; and the authors report that 315 (19%) 
sentences do not match any sentence in the docu-
ment. 
In their 2002 paper, Lin and Hovy examine the 
use of multiple gold standard summaries for 
summarization evaluation, and conclude ?we need 
more than one model summary although we can-
not estimate how many model summaries are re-
quired to achieve reliable automated summary 
evaluation?.  
Attempting to answer that question, van Hal-
teren and Teufel (2003) conclude that 30 to 40 
manual summaries should be sufficient to estab-
lish a stable consensus model summary. Their re-
search, which directly explores the differences and 
similarities between various human summaries to 
establish a basis for such an estimate, finds great 
variation in summary content as reflected in fac-
toids3. This variation does not fall off with the 
number of summaries and accordingly no two 
summaries correlate highly. Although factoid 
measures did not correlate highly with those of 
unigrams (tokens), the former did clearly demon-
strate an importance hierarchy which is an essen-
tial condition if a consensus model summary is to 
be constructed. Our work can thus be seen as con-
firming that, in large measure, van Halteren and 
Teufel?s findings apply to the DUC corpus of 
manual summaries. 
6 Discussion 
We began this study to test two hypotheses. The 
first is this: automatic summarization is made dif-
ficult to the degree that manually-written summa-
ries do not limit themselves to the vocabulary of 
the source document. For a summarization system 
                                                 
3 A factoid is an atomic semantic unit corresponding 
to an expression in first-order predicate logic. As al-
ready noted we approximate phrases to factoids. 
to incorporate words which do not appear in the 
source document requires at a minimum that it has 
a capacity to substitute a synonym of some word 
in the text, and some justification for doing so. 
More likely it would involve constructing a repre-
sentation of the text?s meaning and reasoning 
(generalization, inferencing) on the content of that 
representation. The latter are extremely hard tasks. 
Our second hypothesis is that automatic sum-
marization is made difficult to the degree that 
manually written summaries do not agree among 
themselves. While the variety of possible dis-
agreements are multifarious, the use of different 
vocabulary is a fundamental measure of semantic 
heterogeneity. Authors cannot easily talk of the 
same things if they do not use words in common. 
Unfortunately, our study of the DUC manual 
summaries and their source documents provides 
substantial evidence that summarization of these 
documents remains difficult indeed.  
7 Conclusion 
Previous research on the degree of agreement be-
tween documents and summaries, and between 
summaries, has generally indicated that there are 
significant differences in the vocabulary used by 
authors of summaries and the source document. 
Our study extends the investigation to a corpus 
currently popular in the text summarization re-
search community and finds the majority opinion 
to be borne out there. In addition, our data sug-
gests that summaries resemble the source docu-
ment more closely than they do each other. The 
limited number of summaries available for any 
individual source document prevents us from 
learning any characteristics of the population of 
possible summaries. Would more summaries dis-
tribute themselves evenly throughout the semantic 
space defined by the source document?s vocabu-
lary? Would clumps and clusters show them-
selves, or a single cluster as van Halteren and 
Teufel suggest? If the latter, such a grouping 
would have a good claim to call itself a consensus 
summary of the document and a true gold stan-
dard would be revealed.
