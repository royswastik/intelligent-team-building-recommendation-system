Abstract 
 
Segmental SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) is 
considered to be a reasonable   measure of 
perceptual quality of speech. However it 
only reflects the distortion in time 
dependent contour of the signal due to 
noise. Objective Measures such as Log 
Area Ratio (LAR), Itakura-Saitio 
Distortion (IS), Log-Likelihood Ratio 
(LLR) and Weighted Spectral Slope 
(WSS) are better   measures of perceptual 
speech quality as they represent deviation 
in the spectrum. Noise affects the speech 
time contour and the corresponding 
frequency content. Different languages 
have some peculiar characteristics due to 
variation in the phonetic content and their 
distribution. Distortion introduced by noise 
and application of enhancement algorithm 
varies for different phonemes. In this paper 
a novel idea of using noise and speech 
enhancement as means of identifying a 
language is presented, using objective 
measures of speech quality. Study is done     
on three spoken Indian regional languages 
namely Kashmiri, Bangla and Manipuri, 
when corrupted by white noise. It is found 
that the objective measures of noisy 
speech, when determined using 
corresponding clear and enhanced speech 
are different for different languages over a   
range of SNR, giving clue to the type of   
the language in use. 
1. Introduction 
Speech is a  signal  which   easily   gets   corrupted 
as  it  comes   in  contact   with   the   environment.

Except in sound-proof rooms used in studios, it is 
not possible to find such ideal noise free conditions 
in practice. Although a large number of noises 
exist in environment, broadly they can be classified 
into Factory, Babble, Engine, White and Channel 
noises etc. However most common kind of noise 
encountered is white noise, may it be in 
communication systems due to channel or 
generated in the equipment due to thermal or other 
electronic sources or combination of noises due to 
Central Limit Theorem (Aleksandr Lyapunov, 
1901). Noise thus corrupts the speech, causing 
listener?s fatigue and deteriorating performance of 
speech systems. Application of Speech 
enhancement or noise cancellation algorithms 
alleviates such problems to some extent.  In 
literature several speech enhancement techniques 
exist. Though most traditional algorithms are based 
on optimizing mathematical criteria,  they are not 
well correlated with speech perception and have 
not been as successful in preserving or improving 
quality in all regions of speech, especially 
transitional and unvoiced.  Performance is also 
influenced by the specific type of noise, specific 
SNR, noise estimate updates and algorithm 
parameter settings.  Spectral Subtraction technique 
of speech enhancement is popular and is still 
widely used as front end to speech systems for its 
simplistic nature and high quality performance 
except at very low SNRs (J. Lim, 1983). 
Variety of languages exists in Indian    region, 
with Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman, Indo-European, 
Indo-Aryan and Indo Iranian background.   Mostly 
Indian languages are phonetic in nature that is 
there is one to one correspondence between sounds 
and the representative alphabet, and combining 
them  creates similar kind of sounds. However 
different languages vary in its perceptibility due to 
  
811
differences  in its phonetic contents and variations 
in distribution of different phonemes, stress level 
distribution among phonemes and of course 
intonation pattern, nasality usage, allophonic 
variants, contextual, phonotactic, or coarticulatory 
constraints etc.   
   Introduction of noise in speech distorts the   
speech spectrum and affects its phonetic 
perceptibility differently, due to the factors 
mentioned above. Enhancement of   noisy speech 
though reduces the noise and subsequent irritation, 
but generally results in distortion of the speech 
spectrum. The kind and amount of distortion in the 
spectrum of enhanced speech will depend on the 
particular enhancement technique applied, and the 
SNR of the noisy speech. Therefore different types 
of speech units will get affected differently by the 
noise and subsequent enhancement.  
In this paper, a novel work on identification of 
spoken languages, based on effect of distortion 
introduced by white noise in the phonetic contents 
of different Indian Regional languages namely 
Kashmiri, Bangla and Manipuri is reported. This 
kind of approach is not found in the literature for 
any other language as well. Effect of Speech 
enhancement technique namely spectral 
subtraction on noisy speech of these languages is 
also studied   at different levels of segmental SNR. 
White   noise has been considered for noisy spoken 
language, as it affects all frequency components of 
speech uniformly.  The distortion introduced in the 
resulting speech is measured by estimating 
objective measures of perceptual speech quality 
such as LLR, LAR, IS and WSS (Hansen and 
Pellom, 1998).  The variation of these estimated 
objective measures of the spectral distortion, with 
regard to a particular language, is studied and 
analyzed, to see language specific effects of the 
noise and enhancement algorithm, in order to 
provide clue to the identity   of language in use.  
 The paper has been organized in the following 
form:  Section 2 gives details of Spectral 
Subtraction technique of enhancement used.   
Section 3 gives a comparative study of 
phonotactics of the three languages i.e.  Kashmiri, 
Bangla and Manipuri in brief. Section 4 introduces 
the objective measures used, namely LAR, IS, 
LLR and WSS. Section 5 describes the Results and 
discussion. Section 6 gives conclusions. 
2. Spectral Subtraction   
This technique of speech enhancement is 
computationally very efficient, particularly for 
stationary noise or slowly varying non-stationary 
noise. Spectral subtraction is a noise suppression 
technique used to reduce the effects of added noise 
in speech. It estimates the power of clean speech 
by explicitly subtracting the estimated noise power 
from the noisy speech power. This of course 
assumes that the noise and speech are uncorrelated 
and additive in the time domain. Also, as spectral 
subtraction based  techniques necessitate 
estimation of noise during regions of non-speech 
activity, it is supposed that noise characteristics 
change slowly. However, because noise is 
estimated during speech pauses, this makes the 
method computationally efficient. Unfortunately, 
for these reasons, spectral subtraction is beset by a 
number of problems. First, because noise is 
estimated during pauses the performance of a 
spectral subtraction system relies upon a robust 
noise/speech classification system. If a 
misclassification occurs this may result in a 
misestimating of the noise model and thus a 
degradation of the speech estimate. Spectral 
subtraction may also result in negative power 
spectrum values, which are then reset to non-
negative values. This results in residual noise 
known as musical noise. In a speech enhancement 
application it has been shown that, at 5 dB SNR, 
the quality of the speech signal is improved 
without decreasing intelligibility. However, at 
lower SNR speech this performance reduces 
rapidly. When used in Automatic Speech 
Recognition (ASR), the trade-off between SNR 
improvement and spectral distortion is important. 
To provide a mathematical description of the 
spectral subtraction technique, we write the 
spectrum of the noisy speech y (t) in terms of that 
of the clean speech x (t) and additive noise n (t) 
(the simplest acoustic distortion model): 
   y (t) = x (t) + n (t)                                   - (1)   
The enhancement is explained in the following 
formula (Berouti et al, 1979).

                                                                        - (2)

3. Characteristics of   Manipuri, Bangla and 
Kashmiri spoken languages 
 
Different Indian regional languages have 
certain linguistic background of their own and 
later have added certain foreign loan words. 
Their phonotactics and grammar is also quite 
distinct Following are features of above 
spoken languages:  
Manipuri:  It is a Tibeto-Burman language. Tone 
is used to convey phonemic distinction. Aspirates 
are present.  High frequency of the velar nasal is 
particularly striking. Grammatical gender is 
missing. The normal order of words in a sentence 
is SOV-subject, object, verb, though this is not 
always and everywhere rigorously observed. 
Tibeto-Burman words are monosyllables. 
Phonological system of Manipuri can be 
categorized into two groups ? segmental phonemes 
and supra-segmental phonemes. Segmental 
phoneme includes vowels and consonants and 
supra-segmental phoneme includes tone and 
juncture. All the six Manipuri vowels can occur in 
initial, medial and final position. There are six 
diphthong like sounds in Manipuri. They are 
- ( /?y/,/ay/,   /?w/ ,/oy/, /uy/, /aw/) 
There are 24 consonant phonemes in Manipuri   
p,t,k, ph,th,kh,m, n,?,c,s,l, h,w,y,b d,g,bh,
 dh,gh,j, jh,r  . Among these the last 9 voiced 
sounds are borrowed from other languages and 
they cannot occur in the initial and final position. 
Only four phonemes can occur in the second 
element of the cluster. They are w, y, r and l. It can 
occur only in the initial and medial position of a 
word. There are two types of tone in the language   
level and falling tone. Juncture, other than phonetic 
features, has a phonemic status. 
Bangla: An Indo-Aryan language. Standard 
colloquial Bengali contains 35 essential phonemes. 
5 non-essential phonemes which occur only as 
variants of other sounds or in    borrowed foreign 
words & not used by all speakers. The ten 
aspirated stops and affricates are characteristics 
and essential sounds of   the language. They are 
not simple but compounds.  
( ) )(

)()(? wj yewNwYwX ?
??? ?
Seven vowel phonemes occur with their 
opposite nasal phoneme. All may be long or short. 
Length   is not considered to be phonemic.   There 
is one 1st person pronoun, three 2nd person 
pronouns and three pairs of   3rd person pronouns 
with polite, informal, singular, plural 
discrimination. Pronoun and verb have no gender 
discriminatory word. Most of the sentences don?t 
explicitly use verbs. Verbs are inflected in person 
(1st, 2nd, 3rd), in degrees of politeness (intimate, 
familiar, respectful), and in tense (past, present, 
future).  Plural can be inflected by adding suffix ?
ra, -der, -era, -diger, -guli, -gulo, -gana.  The 
dominant word order in Modern Bengali sentences 
is:  
     Subject + Indirect object + Direct object + 
Oblique object + Verb. 
Kashmiri:  All the vowels have a nasal 
counterpart. Nasalization is phonemic in Kashmiri.   
Palatalization is phonemic in Kashmiri. All the 
non-palatal consonants in Kashmiri can be 
palatalized.   There are eight pairs of short and 
long vowels.   Kashmiri is a syllable-timed 
language, sometimes; individual words are stressed 
for emphasis. There are four major types of 
intonational patterns: (1) High - fall, (2) High - 
rise, (3) Rise &fall, (4) Mid - level. Intonations 
have syntactic rather than emotional content.   
Vowels /?/, /o/, /?:/ do not occur in the word final 
position.  The short vowels /?/, /e/, /u/, and / ?/ do 
not occur in the word-initial position. Usually the 
semi-vowel /y/ is added in the initial position of 
the words beginning with /i/, /i:/, /e/ and /e:/.  
Similarly, the semi-vowel /v/ is added to the words 
beginning with /u/, and /u:/. Vowel sequences 
usually do not occur in Kashmiri. Word initial 
consonant clusters are not as frequent as the word 
medial consonant clusters. Kashmiri has 
(C)(C)V(C)(C) syllable structure.

4. Objective methods  of speech quality 
measure 
In general speech enhancement or noise reduction 
is   measured in terms of improvement in SNR, but  
in reality, this may not be the most appropriate 
performance criteria for improvement of 
perceptual speech quality.  Humans do have an 
intuitive understanding of spoken language quality, 
however this may not be easy to quantify. In a 
number of studies, it has been shown that impact of 
noise on degradation of speech quality is non 
uniform. An objective speech quality measure 
shows, the level of distortion for each frame, 
across time. Since speech frequency content varies, 
across time, due to sequence of phonemes, needed 
to produce the sentence, impact of background 
distortion will also vary, causing some phone 
classes to get more effected than others, when 
produced in a noisy environment. Objective 
methods rely on mathematically based measure 
between reference signal and the signal under 
consideration.  The objective measures are based 
on different parametric representation of the 
speech, and differ due to inclusion or non- 
inclusion of various parameters and the different 
weightage given to them, in order to imitate 
auditory model and perception as closely as 
possible. The details of each one is given below.   
Itakura-Saitio Distortion Measure (IS):  If for 
an original clean frame of speech, linear 
prediction (LP) coefficient vector is                     
, correlation matrix is R
           
where K,        are related to overall sound pressure 
level of the original and enhanced utterances, and 
K
?. And for 
processed speech LP coefficient vector is    , 
correlation matrix is Rd  , then Itakura-Satio 
distortion measure is given by, 
 
 
 
                                                                         - (3) 
Where       and       represents the all-pole gains for 
the processed and clean speech frame respectively. 
Log-Likelihood Ratio Measure (LLR): The LLR 
measure is also referred to as the Itakura distance.  
The LLR measure is found as follows, 
 
                                                            
                                                                   - (4) 
 
Log-Area-Ratio Measure (LAR): The LAR 
measure is also based on dissimilarity of LP 
coefficients between original and processed speech 
signals. The log-area-ratio parameters are obtained 
from the pth order LP reflection coefficients for the 
original              and processed           signals for 
frame j. The objective measure is formed as 
follows, 
 
 
 
 
                                                                    - (5)                           
 
Weighted Spectral Slope Measure (WSS): The 
WSS measure by Klatt (1982) is based on an  
auditory model, in which 36 overlapping filters of 
progressively larger bandwidth are used, to 
estimate the smoothed short-time speech spectrum. 
The measure finds a weighted difference between 
the spectral slopes in each band. The magnitude of 
each weight reflects whether the band is near a 
spectral peak or valley, and whether the peak is the 
largest in the spectrum. A per-frame measure in 
decibel is found as 
 
 
                                                                    - (6) 
spl   is a parameter which can be varied to increase 
overall performance.    
5.  Results and Discussion 
Sentences Spoken by 30 native speakers for each 
language namely Manipuri, Bangla and Kashmiri 
were recorded at 16 KHz. Noisy speech with white 
noise   was simulated  with  segmental  SNR  from 
30 dB to -20 dB. Objective measures i.e. IS, LAR, 
LLR and WSS are computed for each frame, with 
length ~ 512 samples. In first experiment these 
measures are computed for the noisy speech with   
reference to the corresponding clean speech 
sentence, whereas in second experiment the 
objective measures   are computed using enhanced 
speech and the corresponding noisy speech for 
different sentences of the languages.  Estimates   of 
these measures are determined for the complete 
sentence  using two methods, namely 5% trim

mean and median of their values computed for 
each frame.  Spectral subtraction method of 
enhancement is applied to obtain enhanced speech 
from the noisy speech sentences. For 10 dB 
SegSNR noisy speech, the spectrograms of the 
speech in three languages corresponding to Clean, 
Noisy and Enhanced, is shown in figure 1. It is 
observed through the spectrograms, that the noise 
has affected the three languages differently.

Estimates of LLR, LAR, IS and WSS are 
computed for SNR range 30 dB to -30 dB for 
different speech sentences in the three languages 
using noisy and clear and then enhanced and noisy 
speech. It is seen that WSS measure has the widest 
dynamic range almost 10 times the other measures 
 
 
 
 
 
 
?Figure 2. LLR, LAR, IS and WSS estimates vs. 
SNR plots in Manipuri Speech with experiment-1.? 
 as shown in figure 2. of experiment -1, using 
Manipuri Speech.  Thus it can be seen, that WSS is 
most suitable for the studies of distortion effects, 
of noise and enhancement algorithm, on different 
spoken languages.   
WSS estimates of noisy speech, at different SNR 
are computed, as in experiment-1, and plotted in 
figure 3. It is observed that Manipuri is having 
lowest WSS estimate followed by Kashmiri and 
then highest for Bangla. This trend is more 
prominent particularly for low SNRs. The other 
points of plot are for Hindi and mixed languages.

( denoted in x axis by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively)? 
In experiment 2, WSS and LAR estimates are 
computed for enhanced speech, with reference to the 
corresponding noisy speech, for the three languages 
namely Kashmiri, Manipuri, and Bangla. The 
enhanced speech is obtained after application of 
  
815
spectral subtraction algorithm on noisy speech of   of
different SNRs,   ranging   from  30 dB  to  -20 dB  
 
In this paper a study is done for possibility of using     
LLR, LAR, IS and WSS as objective measures of 
speech   quality,   for discrimination of   Indian 
regional languages namely Kashmiri, Manipuri and 
Bangla. This is done by computing estimates of 
these objective measures for noisy speech with 
white noise for the above spoken languages and at 
SNRs  -30 dB to 30 dB. First these measures are 
computed for noisy speech with reference to 
corresponding clear speech and then for the 
enhanced speech with reference to the 
corresponding noisy speech. WSS has proved to be 
the most useful measure used due to its wider 
dynamic range.  The two estimates of WSS do 
provide clue to the type of language in use due to 
differences in its phonetic content. The 
discrimination provided is highest at lower SNRs. 
The estimate being lowest for Manipuri, and 
highest for Bangla. The reason could be attributed 
to the presence of weaker speech units in relatively 
higher concentration, in the language with higher 
WSS estimates compared to others; as    the speech 
parameters under consideration for them, would 
undergo higher distortion under the influence of 
noise.   
in steps of 5 dB. The mean and median  estimates  
of the WSS for  the 2nd  experiment  are shown  in  
table 1.  Here  also  the  WSS  estimate  is  lowest 
 for Manipuri, followed by Kashmiri  and  Bangla   
 is the highest.  This trend  is  more prominent for  
 low SNRs.
