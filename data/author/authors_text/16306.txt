Abstract
It has remained an open question whether
the twins property for weighted tree au-
tomata is decidable. This property is crucial
for determinizing such an automaton, and
it has been argued that determinization im-
proves the output of parsers and translation
systems. We show that the twins property
for weighted tree automata over extremal
semifields is decidable.
1 Introduction
In natural-language processing (NLP), language
and translation are often modeled using some
kind of grammar, automaton or transducer, such
as a probabilistic context-free grammar, a syn-
chronous context-free grammar, a weighted tree
automaton, or a tree transducer, among others
(May and Knight, 2006; Petrov et al, 2006; Chi-
ang, 2007; Graehl, Knight and May, 2008; Zhang
et al, 2008; Pauls and Klein, 2009). In statisti-
cal NLP, the structure of the grammar is extracted
heuristically from a large corpus of example sen-
tences or sentence pairs, and the rule weights are
estimated using methods from statistics or ma-
chine learning.
In general, a grammar such as those named
above will be ambiguous, i.e., offering several
ways of deriving the same object (sentence or sen-
tence pair). While the derivation of an object is
crucial to the intrinsics of a system, it is neither
relevant to the user nor observed in the corpus.
Hence, we speak of spurious ambiguity (Li, Eis-
ner and Khudanpur, 2009).
As a consequence, the true importance of an
object can only be assessed by aggregating all
its derivations. Unfortunately, this proves com-
putationally intractable in almost all cases: for
instance, finding the best string of a probabilis-
tic regular grammar is NP hard (Sima?an, 1996;
Casacuberta and de la Higuera, 2000). Finding
the best derivation, on the other hand, is possible
in polynomial time (Eppstein, 1998; Huang and
Chiang, 2005), and thus, most NLP systems ap-
proximate the importance of an object by its best
derivation (Li, Eisner and Khudanpur, 2009).
There is, however, a line of research that deals
with the costly aggregating approach, and it is
closely related to determinization techniques from
automata theory.
For instance, May and Knight (2006) argue
that the output of a parser or syntax-based trans-
lation system can be represented by a weighted
tree automaton (wta), which assigns a weight to
each parse tree. Under some circumstances, the
wta can be determinized, yielding an equivalent,
but unambiguous wta, which offers at most one
derivation for each object. Then the weight of an
object is equal to the weight of its derivation, and
the aforementioned polynomial-time algorithms
deliver exact results.
The caveat of the determinization approach is
that deterministic weighted automata are strictly
less powerful than their general counterparts,
i.e., not every automaton can be determinized.
B?chse, May and Vogler (2010) give a review of
known sufficient conditions under which deter-
minization is possible. One of these conditions
requires that (i) the weights are calculated in an
extremal semiring, (ii) there is a maximal factor-
ization, and (iii) the wta has the twins property.1
1Items (i) and (iii) guarantee that the wta only computes
weight vectors that are scalar multiples of a finite number
11
Regarding (i), we note that in an extremal semi-
ring the weight of a parse tree is equal to the
weight of its best derivation. It follows that, while
the determinized wta will have at most one deriva-
tion per parse tree, its weight will be the weight of
the best derivation of the original wta. The benefit
of determinization reduces to removing superflu-
ous derivations from the list of best derivations.
Regarding (ii), the factorization is used in
the determinization construction to distribute the
weight computation in the determinized automa-
ton between its transition weights and its state be-
havior. A maximal factorization exists for every
zero-sum free semifield.
Regarding (iii), the question whether the twins
property is decidable has remained open for a long
time, until Kirsten (2012)2 gave an affirmative an-
swer for a particular case: weighted string au-
tomata over the tropical semiring. He also showed
that the decision problem is PSPACE-complete.
In this paper, we close one remaining gap by
adapting and generalizing Kirsten?s proof: we
show that the twins property is decidable for wta
over extremal semifields (Theorem 3.1). We pro-
ceed by recalling the concepts related to deter-
minizing wta, such as ranked trees, semirings,
factorizations, wta themselves, and the twins
property (Sec. 2). Then we show our main the-
orem, including two decision algorithms (Sec. 3).
Finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion
and some open questions (Sec. 4).
2 Preliminaries
2.1 Ranked Trees
A ranked alphabet is a tuple (?, rk) where ? is an
alphabet, i.e., a finite set, and rk : ?? N assigns
an arity to every symbol ? ? ?. Throughout this
paper we will identify (?, rk) with ?. For every
k ? N the set ?(k) = {? ? ? | rk(?) = k}
contains all symbols of arity k.
Let H be a set and ? a ranked alphabet. The
set T?(H) of trees over ? indexed by H is de-
fined inductively as the smallest set T such that:
(i) H ? T and (ii) ?(?1, . . . , ?k) ? T for every
of vectors corresponding to a set of height-bounded trees,
while Item (ii) ensures that the latter vectors suffice as the
states of the constructed deterministic wta; cf. (B?chse, May
and Vogler, 2010, Lm. 5.9 and Lm. 5.8, respectively).
2A manuscript with the same content has been available
on Daniel Kirsten?s website for a year from Sept. 2010 on.
k ? N, ? ? ?(k), and ?1, . . . , ?k ? T . We write
T? instead of T?(?).
For every ? ? T?(H), we define the set
pos(?) ? N? of positions of ? by
(i) if ? ? H , then pos(?) = {?};
(ii) if ? = ?(?1, . . . , ?k), then pos(?) = {?} ?
{i ? w | i ? {1, . . . , k}, w ? pos(?i)}.
The mapping ht: T?(H) ? N maps each tree ?
to its height, i.e., the length of a longest position
of ?. We denote the label of ? at position w by
?(w), the subtree of ? rooted at w by ?|w, and the
tree obtained by replacing the subtree of ? rooted
at position w with ??, ?? ? T?(H), by ?[??]w.
A ?-context is a tree in T?({z}) that contains
exactly one occurrence of the special symbol z.
The set of all ?-contexts is denoted by C?. Let
? ? T??C? and ? ? C?. Then the concatenation
of ? and ?, denoted by ? ? ?, is obtained from ? by
replacing the leaf z by ?. If ? ? T?, then so is
? ? ?, and likewise for ? ? C?.
2.2 Semirings
A semiring (Hebisch and Weinert, 1998; Golan,
1999) is a quintuple S = (S,+, ?, 0, 1) where S
is a set, + and ? are binary, associative operations
on S, called addition and multiplication, respec-
tively, + is commutative, ? distributes over + from
both sides, 0 and 1 are elements of S, 0 is neu-
tral with respect to +, 1 is neutral with respect
to ?, and 0 is absorbing with respect to ? (i.e.,
s ? 0 = 0 = 0 ? s).
Let S = (S,+, ?, 0, 1) be a semiring. In nota-
tion, we will identify S with S. We call S commu-
tative if the multiplication is commutative; a semi-
field if it is commutative and for every a ? S\{0}
there is an a?1 ? S such that a ? a?1 = 1; zero-
sum free if a + b = 0 implies a = b = 0; zero-
divisor free if a ? b = 0 implies a = 0 or b = 0;
and extremal (Mahr, 1984) if a + b ? {a, b}. We
note that every extremal semiring is also zero-sum
free and every semifield is zero-divisor free.
Example 2.1 We present four examples
of semirings. The Boolean semiring
B = ({0, 1},?,?, 0, 1), with disjunction
and conjunction, is an extremal semifield. The
formal-language semiring (P(??),?, ?, ?, {?})
over an alphabet ?, with union and language
concatenation, is neither commutative nor ex-
tremal, but zero-divisor free and zero-sum free.
The tropical semiring (R ? {?},min,+,?, 0),
with minimum and conventional addition, is
12
an extremal semifield. The Viterbi semiring
([0, 1],max, ?, 0, 1) is a commutative, extremal,
zero-divisor-free semiring, but not a semifield. 2
Let Q be a set. The set SQ contains all map-
pings u : Q ? S, or, equivalently, all Q-vectors
over S. Instead of u(q) we also write uq to de-
note the q-component of a vector u ? SQ. The
Q-vector mapping every q to 0 is denoted by 0?.
For every q ? Q we define eq ? SQ such that
(eq)q = 1, and (eq)p = 0 for every p 6= q.
2.3 Factorizations
We use the notion of a factorization as defined in
(Kirsten and M?urer, 2005).
Let Q be a nonempty finite set. A pair (f, g) is
called a factorization of dimension Q if f : SQ \
{0?} ? SQ, g : SQ\{0?} ? S, and u = g(u)?f(u)
for every u ? SQ \ {0?}. A factorization (f, g) is
called maximal if for every u ? SQ and a ? S,
we have that a ? u 6= 0? implies f(a ? u) = f(u).
Example 2.2 Let Q be a nonempty finite set. We
show three factorizations of dimension Q.
If S is an arbitrary semiring, g(u) = 1 and
f(u) = u constitute the trivial factorization. It
is not maximal in general.
If S is a zero-sum free semifield, such as the
tropical semiring or the semifield of non-negative
reals, then g(u) =
?
q?Q uq and f(u) =
1
g(u) ?
u constitute a factorization (B?chse, May and
Vogler, 2010, Lemma 4.2). It is maximal: f(a ?
u) = 1g(a?u) ? (a ? u) =
1
a?g(u) ? a ? u = f(u).
As shown in (B?chse, May and Vogler, 2010,
Lemma 4.4) a maximal factorization only exists
if S is zero-divisor free or |Q| = 1.
2.4 Weighted Tree Automata
A weighted tree automaton (?sik and Kuich,
2003) is a finite-state machine that represents a
weighted tree language, i.e., a mapping ? : T? ?
S. It assigns a weight to every tree based on
weighted transitions.
Formally, a weighted tree automaton (wta) is
a tuple A = (Q,?, S, ?, ?) such that Q is a
nonempty finite set (of states), ? is a ranked al-
phabet, S is a semiring, ? is the transition map-
ping, mapping transitions (q1 ? ? ? qk, ?, q) into S
where q1, . . . , qk, q ? Q and ? ? ?(k), and
? ? SQ maps every state to its root weight.
A wta A is bottom-up deterministic if for ev-
ery (q1 ? ? ? qk, ?), there is at most one q such that
?(q1 ? ? ? qk, ?, q) 6= 0.
Example 2.3 Let A = (Q,?, S, ?, ?) be the wta
where ? = {?(0), ?(1), ?(2)}, S is the arctic semi-
ring (N ? {??},max,+,??, 0), ? is given by
the directed functional hypergraph in Fig. 1, and
? = (0,??). Each node in the hypergraph
(drawn as circle) corresponds to a state, and each
hyperedge (drawn as box with arbitrarily many in-
going arcs and exactly one outgoing arc) repre-
sents a weighted transition. Ingoing arcs of a hy-
peredge are meant to be read counter-clockwise,
starting from the outgoing arc. The final weight 0
of q1 is indicated by an additional arc. Transitions
not shown have the weight ??. 2

Figure 1: Hypergraph representation of wta A.
Typically, wta are given initial-algebra seman-
tics (Goguen et al, 1977). In this paper, we use
the equivalent run semantics (F?l?p and Vogler,
2009, Sec. 3.2) as it constitutes the basis for our
proofs. In this setting, every node of a given tree is
decorated with a state; this decoration is called a
run. The label of a node, its state, and the states of
its successors comprise a transition. The weight
of a run is given by the product of the weights
of all these transitions (under ?), calculated in the
semiring S. Roughly speaking, the weight of a
tree is then the sum of the weights of all runs on
that tree, again calculated in S.
Now we formalize the notions of a run and
its weight. For our proofs, we will need runs
and their weights to be as easily composable and
decomposable as trees and contexts. Therefore,
we will consider trees indexed by semiring ele-
ments and even Q-vectors over S. Let H be a set,
? ? T?(H), and q ? Q. The setR
q
A(?) of all runs
on ? that end in state q at the root of ? is
RqA(?) = {(?, ?) | ? : pos(?)? Q, ?(?) = q} .

Figure 2: A tree together with a run.
We will denote the pair (?, ?) just by ? and indi-
cate ? by stating ? ? RqA(?). We will also omit
the subscript A. We set R(?) =
?
q?QR
q(?).
Let w ? pos(?) and ? ? Rq(?). The fol-
lowing notions are defined in the obvious way:
(i) ?|w ? R?(w)(?|w), (ii) ?[??]w ? Rq(?[??]w)
for every ?? ? T?(H) and ?? ? R?(w)(??), and
(iii) ? ? ?? ? Rq
?
(? ? ?) for every q? ? Q, ? ? C?,
and ?? ? Rq
?
(?) that maps the z-labelled posi-
tion to q. We will abuse the above notation in
two ways: (i) we write ?[z]w to denote ?[??]w
where ?? is the only element of R?(w)(z), and
(ii) for every s ? S, we write s ? ? to denote the
run on s ? ? which coincides with ?.
Let ? ? T?(S ? SQ) and ? ? R(?). We define
the weight ???A ? S of ? as follows (omitting the
subscript A): if ? ? S, then ??? = ?; if ? ? SQ,
then ??? = ??(?); if ? = ?(?1, . . . , ?k), then ??? =
??|1? ? . . . ? ??|k? ? ?(?(1) ? ? ??(k), ?, ?(?)).
We define the mapping J.KA : T?(SQ) ? SQ
such that J?KA(q) =
?
??Rq(?)???. Again, we
will often omit the subscript A. If we have a fac-
torization (f, g), we will shorten f(J?K) to fJ?K.
We will often use relationships such as ?? ? ??? =
???? ? ??? and J? ? ?K = JJ?K ? ?K.
The weighted tree language run-recognized
by A is the mapping ?A : T? ? S such that for
every ? ? T? we have ?A(?) =
?
q?QJ?Kq ? ?q.
Example 2.4 (Ex. 2.3 contd.) Figure 2 shows a
tree together with a run ?. We compute ??? (recall
that we use the arctic semiring):
??? = ??|1?+ ??|2?+ ?(q2q1, ?, q1)
= ?(?, ?, q2) + ?(?, ?, q1) + ?(q1, ?, q1)
+ ?(q1, ?, q1) + ?(?, ?, q2)
+ ?(q1q2, ?, q1) + ?(q2q1, ?, q1)
= 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 4 .
It can be shown that J?Kq1 = ht(?) and J?Kq2 =
0, and thus, that ?A = ht. 2
For every ? ? T?(SQ) and ? ? R(?) we call
? victorious (on ?) if ??? = J?K?(?). The follow-
ing observations are based on (B?chse, May and
Vogler, 2010, Obs. 5.11 and 5.12).
Observation 2.5 Let S be an extremal semiring.
For every ? ? T?(SQ) and q ? Q there is a ? ?
Rq(?) such that ? is victorious.
Observation 2.6 Let ? ? T?(SQ), w ? pos(?),
and ? ? R(?) victorious. Then we obtain ??? =
J(??|w? ? e?(w)) ? ?[z]wK?(?).
PROOF.
J(??|w? ? e?(w)) ? ?[z]wK?(?)
=
?
???R?(?)
(
(??|w??e?(w))??[z]w
)????
=
?
???R?(?)(?[z]w),??(w)=?(w)???|w? ? ?
??
=
?
???R?(?)(?[z]w),??(w)=?(w)??|w ? ?
??
= ??? .
For the last equation, we note that the summands
on the left-hand side form a subset of {??? | ? ?
R?(?)(?)}, which contains ???. Since S is ex-
tremal and ??? = J?K?(?), the equation holds. 
2.5 Twins Property
We define two binary relations SIBLINGS(A) and
TWINS(A) overQ as follows. Let p, q ? Q. Then
? (p, q) ? SIBLINGS(A) iff there is a tree ? ?
T? such that J?Kp 6= 0 and J?Kq 6= 0.
? (p, q) ? TWINS(A) iff for every context ? ?
C? we have that Jep ??Kp 6= 0 and Jeq ??Kq 6=
0 implies Jep ? ?Kp = Jeq ? ?Kq.
The wta A is said to have the twins property if
SIBLINGS(A) ? TWINS(A).
Example 2.7 We cover two examples.
First, consider the wta from Ex. 2.3. Its two
states are siblings as witnessed by the tree ? = ?.
However, they are not twins, as witnessed by the
context ? = ?(z): Jeq1 ? ?(z)Kq1 = 1, whereas
Jeq2 ? ?(z)Kq2 = 0.
Second, consider the wta over the Viterbi semi-
ring shown Fig. 3. Its two states are siblings as
witnessed by the tree ? = ?. Furthermore, they
are twins because their transitions are symmetric.
Hence, this wta has the twins property. 2
The following observation shows that we can
enumerate SIBLINGS(A) in finite time.

Observation 2.8 If S is zero-sum free, we have
SIBLINGS(A) = SIB(A) where SIB(A) is de-
fined like SIBLINGS(A), with the additional con-
dition that ht(?) < |Q|2.
PROOF. The direction ? is trivial. We show ?
by contradiction. Let p, q ? Q and ? ? T? such
that (i) J?Kp 6= 0 and J?Kq 6= 0, and (ii) (p, q) 6?
SIB(A). We assume that ? is smallest, and we
show that we find a smaller counterexample.
By (ii), we have (iii) ht(?) ? |Q|2. By (i),
there are ?p ? Rp(?) and ?q ? Rq(?) such that
(iv) ??p? 6= 0 and ??q? 6= 0.
By (iii), there are positions w1, w2 such that w1
is above w2, ?p(w1) = ?p(w2), and ?q(w1) =
?q(w2). Cutting out the slice between w1 and w2,
we construct the tree ?? = ?[?|w2 ]w1 . Moreover,
we construct the runs ??p and ?
?
q accordingly, i.e.,
??x = ?x[?x|w2 ]w1 .
We have that ???p? 6= 0, ??
?
q? 6= 0, because oth-
erwise (iv) would be violated. Since S is zero-
sum free, we obtain J??Kp 6= 0, J??Kq 6= 0. 
3 Decidability of the Twins Property
This section contains our main theorem:
Theorem 3.1 The twins property of wta over ex-
tremal semifields is decidable.
The following subsections provide the infra-
structure and lemmata needed for the proof of the
theorem. Henceforth, we assume that S is an ex-
tremal semifield. As noted in Ex. 2.2, there is a
maximal factorization (f, g).
3.1 Rephrasing the Twins Relation
In the definition of TWINS(A), we deal with two
vectors Jep ? ?K and Jeq ? ?K for each ? ? C?. In
the following we concatenate these vectors into
one, which enables us to use a factorization. To
this end, we construct a wta A ? A? that runs two
instances of A in parallel, as shown in Fig. 4.
Let A = (Q,?, S, ?, ?) a wta and A? =
(Q?,?, S, ??, ??) be the wta obtained from A by re-
naming states via q 7? q?. We construct the wta
A? A? = (Q ? Q?,?, S, ??, ? ?) where ?? coincides
with ? and ?? on the transitions of A and A?, re-
spectively; it maps all other transitions to 0; and ? ?
coincides with ? and ?? on Q and Q?, respectively.
For every p, q ? Q we define the set Tp,q ?
SQ?Q? by Tp,q = {J(ep + eq?) ? ?KA?A? | ? ? C?};
note that ep, eq? ? SQ?Q?. With this definition, we
observe the following trivial equivalence.
Observation 3.2 Let p, q ? Q. Then (p, q) ?
TWINS(A) iff for every u ? Tp,q we have that
up 6= 0 and uq? 6= 0 implies up = uq?.
For every pair (p, q) ? SIBLINGS(A), a vector
u ? SQ?Q? is called a critical vector (for (p, q))
if it does not fulfill the centered implication of
Obs. 3.2. Any critical vector in Tp,q thereby wit-
nesses (p, q) 6? TWINS(A). Consequently, A has
the twins property iff Tp,q contains no critical vec-
tor for any (p, q) ? SIBLINGS(A). Deciding the
twins property thus amounts to searching for a
critical vector.
3.2 Compressing the Search Space
In this subsection we approach the decidability
of the twins property by compressing the search
space for critical vectors. First we show that the
vectors in Tp,q are scalar multiples of a finite num-
ber of vectors.
Lemma 3.3 Let S be a commutative, extremal
semiring. Assume that A has the twins property.
Then there is a finite set S? ? SQ?Q? such that for
every (p, q) ? SIBLINGS(A) we have
Tp,q ? S ? S
?.
PROOF. We construct sets S?, S?? ? SQ?Q? and
show the following inclusions:
Tp,q ? S ? S
?? ? S ? S?. (?)

To this end, we consider each entry in each vector
to be induced by an according (victorious) run.
In this spirit we define for every p, q ? Q and
? ? C? the set Cp,q(?) ? R((ep + eq?) ? ?)Q?Q? of
vectors of runs of A ? A? as follows: ? ? Cp,q(?)
iff (i) ?r ? Rr((ep + eq?) ? ?) for every r ? Q? Q?
and (ii) for every pair w1, w2 ? pos(?) with w1
above w2 and ?r(w1) = ?r(w2) we have that
?r|w1 is victorious on ((ep + eq?) ? ?)|w1 . We map
each vector of runs to the corresponding weight
vector as follows. For every Q? ? Q ? Q? let
?Q? : R((ep + eq?) ? ?)Q?Q? ? SQ?Q? be the map-
ping such that for every ? and q? ? Q ? Q?:
?Q?(?)q? =
{
??q?? if q? ? Q?
0 otherwise.
We set S?? = {?Q?(?) | (p, q) ? SIBLINGS(A),
? ? C?, ? ? Cp,q(?), Q? ? Q? Q?}. The set S? is
defined in the same way, with the additional con-
dition that ht(?) < 2|Q|2|Q|.
The first inclusion of (?) can be proved in the
same way as (B?chse, May and Vogler, 2010,
Lemma 5.14). Here we show the second inclu-
sion by contradiction. To this end, let s ? S,
(p, q) ? SIBLINGS(A), ? ? C?, ? ? Cp,q(?),
and Q? ? Q ? Q? such that s ? ?Q?(?) 6? S ? S?,
and thus ht(?) ? 2|Q|2|Q|. We can assume that
??r? 6= 0 for every r ? Q? because otherwise we
could adjustQ? without harm. Finally, we assume
that ? is smallest.
We will construct a new context ? ? and a cor-
responding vector ?? ? Cp,q(? ?) such that ? ? is
smaller than ? and s ? ?Q?(?) = s ? s? ? ?Q?(??)
for some s? ? S. Then, if the right-hand side is in
S ? S?, so is the left-hand side. By contraposition,
this shows that ? was not a smallest counterexam-
ple, yielding the contradiction.
First, let w be the position in ? labelled z. We
show that we are able to find a pair (w1, w2) of
positions such that w1 is above w2, ?r(w1) =
?r(w2) for every r, and either both or none of w1
and w2 are above w. To this end, we distinguish
two cases (cf. Fig. 5).
(a) If |w| ? |Q|2|Q|, then the length of the com-
mon prefix of w and any path of length at least
2|Q|2|Q| can be at most |Q|2|Q|. Hence, on such a
path remain at least |Q|2|Q| + 1 positions that are
not above w. By the pidgeonhole principle, we
find said pair (w1, w2).
(b) If |w| > |Q|2|Q|, then we find the pair im-
mediately on the path to the position labelled z.
Second, we pick a pair (w1, w2) such that the
position w1 has minimal length. Cutting out the
slice between the positions w1 and w2 yields the
smaller context ? ? = ?[?|w2 ]w1 . We construct ?
?
accordingly, i.e., ??r = ?r[?r|w2 ]w1 for every r ?
Q ? Q?. We have that ?? ? Cp,q(? ?); for this we

need that we chose w1 with minimal length.
Third, we use the twins property to show that
there is an s? ? S such that s ? ?Q?(?) = s ? s? ?
?Q?(??). If Q? = ?, we set s? = 0, and the proof is
done. Otherwise we choose some r? ? Q? and set
s? = Je?r? (w2)??
??K?r? (w1) where ?
?? = ?[z]w2 |w1 is
the slice we have cut out. We prove that ?Q?(?) =
s???Q?(??). To this end, let r ? Q?, p? = ?r(w1) =
?r(w2), and q? = ?r?(w1) = ?r?(w2). Then
?Q?(?)r = ??r? = ???r|w1? ? ?r[z]w1?
= ?J(??r|w2? ? ep?) ? ?

= s? ? ???r|w2? ? ?r[z]w1? (commutativity)
= s? ? ???r? = s
? ? ?Q?(?
?)r .
At (?) we have used the twins property. We show
that this is justified. First, we show that (p?, q?) ?
SIBLINGS(A ? A?). To this end, we distinguish
two cases.
If z occurs in ?|w2 : by (p, q) ? SIBLINGS(A)
we obtain a tree ? such that J?Kp 6= 0 and J?Kq 6=
0. By our assumption we have ??r? 6= 0, ??r?? 6=
0, and thus, ??r|w2? 6= 0, ??r? |w2? 6= 0. Since S
is extremal, and thus, zero-sum free, we obtain
J? ? ?|w2Kp? 6= 0, J? ? ?|w2Kq? 6= 0.
If z does not occur in ?|w2 : we derive in a sim-
ilar fashion that ??r|w2? 6= 0, ??r? |w2? 6= 0, and
thus, J?|w2Kp? 6= 0, J?|w2Kq? 6= 0.
Second, by the twins property, we have that
(p?, q?) ? TWINS(A ? A?). Using again that
??r? 6= 0, ??r?? 6= 0, we derive ??r[z]w2 |w1? 6= 0,
??r? [z]w2 |w1? 6= 0. Hence, Jep? ? ?
??Kp? 6= 0,
Jeq? ? ? ??Kq? 6= 0. Consequently, we have (?). 
We note that u ? SQ?Q?, u 6= 0?, is a critical
vector iff f(u) is a critical vector. Hence, ap-
plying the factorization to Tp,q for every (p, q) ?
SIBLINGS(A) results in a compressed search
space for critical vectors. It follows from the pre-
ceding lemma that the resulting search space is
finite.
Lemma 3.4 Let (f, g) be a maximal factorization
of dimension Q? Q?. Assume thatA has the twins
property. For every (p, q) ? SIBLINGS(A) the set
f(Tp,q \ {0?}) is finite.
PROOF. By Lemma 3.3 there is a finite set S? with
f(Tp,q \ {0?}) ? f(S ? S
?) ? f(S?) ,
where we used that (f, g) is maximal. Since S? is
finite, so is f(Tp,q \ {0?}). 

3.3 Two Decision Algorithms
In this section we consider two decision algo-
rithms. The first one is part of the following proof.
PROOF (OF THM. 3.1). Algorithm 1 proceeds as
follows. First, it enumerates SIBLINGS(A). This
is possible as shown by Obs. 2.8. Second, for each
(p, q) ? SIBLINGS(A) in parallel, it enumerates
f(Tp,q \ {0?}), checking for critical vectors. For
this step, we distinguish two cases.
Either A has the twins property. Then, by
Lemma 3.4, f(Tp,q \ {0?}) is finite, and the algo-
rithm will terminate without finding any critical
vector, in which case it outputs ?yes?.
OrA does not have the twins property, but then,
by Obs. 3.2, the algorithm is guaranteed to find
a critical vector at some point, in which case it
outputs ?no?. Note that the parallel processing
(line 2) is critical in this case because there may
be (p, q) ? SIBLINGS(A) such that f(Tp,q \ {0?})
is infinite, but does not contain a critical vector. 
Note that Algorithm 1 basically enumerates the
set
?
(p,q)?SIBLINGS(A) f(Tp,q \ {0?}). In principle,
this can be done by enumerating C? and comput-
ing fJ(ep + eq?) ? ?K for each ? ? C?. However,
the computation of weights already done for sub-
contexts of ? is not reused in this approach.
In the following we show an alternative proce-
dure (Algorithm 2) that does not enumerate C?
explicitly but works on weight vectors instead,
thereby avoiding redundant calculation. This pro-
cedure maintains a pair of subsets of SQ?Q?. It
begins with (?, ?) and keeps adding vectors by
applying a monotone operation F until either the
second component contains a critical vector or no
new vectors are added.
To this end, we define the unary operation F
over pairs of subsets of SQ?Q? by (T,C) 7?

lowing elements:
(F1) for every k ? 0, ? ? ?(k), and
u1, . . . , uk ? T , if J?(u1, . . . , uk)K 6= 0?,
then fJ?(u1, . . . , uk)K ? T ?,
(F2) for every (p, q) ? SIBLINGS(A), we have
f(ep + eq?) ? C ?,
(F3) for every k ? 1, ? ? ?(k), i ? {1, . . . , k},
ui ? C, and u1, . . . , ui?1, ui+1, . . . , uk ?
T , if J?(u1, . . . , uk)K 6= 0?, then
fJ?(u1, . . . , uk)K ? C ?.
Kleene?s fixpoint theorem (Wechler, 1992,
Sec. 1.5.2, Theorem 7) yields that F has a least
fixpoint (where we use the pointwise subset or-
der), and that it can be calculated by the satura-
tion procedure outlined above. In the forthcoming
Lemma 3.6, we show that said fixpoint contains
the desired set
?
(p,q)?SIBLINGS(A) f(Tp,q \ {0?}).
This implies both the correctness of our procedure
and its termination, by the same line of reasoning
as for Algorithm 1. As a preparation we recall two
auxiliary statements.
Observation 3.5 Let S be commutative and
(f, g) maximal. Then for every k ? 0, ? ? ?(k),
and ?1, . . . , ?k ? T?(SQ), we have that
J?(?1, . . . , ?k)K = J?(J?1K, . . . , J?kK)K and
fJ?(J?1K, . . . , J?kK)K = fJ?(fJ?1K, . . . , fJ?kK)K.
PROOF. By (F?l?p and Vogler, 2009, Sec 3.2)
and (B?chse, May and Vogler, 2010, Lemma 5.5),
respectively. 
Lemma 3.6 Let (T f , Cf ) be the least fixpoint
of F . Then (i) T f = f(JT?K \ {0?}) and (ii) Cf =?
(p,q)?SIBLINGS(A) f(Tp,q \ {0?}).
18
PROOF. In this proof we will often use Obs. 3.5.
For ??? of Statement (i), we refer to (B?chse,
May and Vogler, 2010, Lemma 5.8).
We prove ??? of Statement (i) by contradic-
tion. To this end, let ? ? T? a smallest tree such
that J?K 6= 0? and fJ?K 6? T f . By definition of T?,
there are k ? 0, ? ? ?(k), and ?1, . . . , ?k ? T?
such that ? = ?(?1, . . . , ?k). We derive
fJ?(?1, . . . , ?k)K = fJ?(J?1K, . . . , J?kK)K
= fJ?(fJ?1K, . . . , fJ?kK)K .
Now either fJ?iK ? T f for every i ? {1, . . . , k},
but then so is fJ?K, or ? was not the smallest coun-
terexample.
For ??? of Statement (ii), we show that
(
T f ,
?
(p,q)?SIBLINGS(A) f(Tp,q \ {0?})
)
is a pre-
fixpoint of F . It is easy to see that (F1) and (F2)
hold. Now let k, ?, i, u1, . . . , uk as in (F3) such
that J?(u1, . . . , uk)K 6= 0?. Hence, u1, . . . , uk 6=
0?. By (i) there are ?1, . . . , ?i?1, ?i+1, . . . , ?k such
that uj = fJ?jK for j 6= i. Moreover there are
(p, q) ? SIBLINGS(A) and ?i ? C? such that
ui = fJ(ep + eq?) ? ?iK. We derive
fJ?(u1, . . . , uk)K
= fJ?(fJ?1K, . . . , fJ(ep + eq?) ? ?iK, . . . , fJ?kK)K
= fJ?(J?1K, . . . , J(ep + eq?) ? ?iK, . . . , J?kK)K
= fJ?(?1, . . . , (ep + eq?) ? ?i, . . . , ?k)K
= fJ(ep + eq?) ? ?(?1, . . . , ?i, . . . , ?k)K ,
which, by definition, is in f(Tp,q \ {0?}).
We prove ??? of (ii) by contradiction. To
this end, let (p, q) ? SIBLINGS(A) and ? ?
C? a smallest context such that fJ(ep + eq?) ?
?K ? f(Tp,q \ {0?}) \ Cf . Hence, J(ep + eq?) ?
?K 6= 0?. By (F2), we obtain ? 6= z. Hence,
there are k ? 1, ? ? ?(k), i ? {1, . . . , k},
?1, . . . , ?i?1, ?i+1, . . . , ?k ? T?, and ?i ? C?
such that ? = ?(?1, . . . , ?i?1, ?i, ?i+1, . . . , ?k).
We have that J?jK 6= 0? for j 6= i, and J(ep +
eq?) ? ?iK 6= 0?. We derive
fJ(ep + eq?) ? ?K
= fJ(ep + eq?) ? ?(?1, . . . , ?i, . . . , ?k)K
= fJ?(?1, . . . , (ep + eq?) ? ?i, . . . , ?k)K
= fJ?(J?1K, . . . , J(ep + eq?) ? ?iK, . . . , J?kK)K
= fJ?(fJ?1K, . . . , fJ(ep + eq?) ? ?iK, . . . , fJ?kK)K
By (i), we have that fJ?jK ? T f . Now ei-
ther fJ(ep + eq?) ? ?iK ? Cf , but then so is
fJ(ep + eq?) ? ?K, or ? was not the smallest coun-
terexample. 
4 Discussion and Further Research
The notion that the twins property can be decided
by searching for critical vectors in a compressed
search space is due to Kirsten (2012). We have
generalized his work in two ways: (i) We allow
arbitrary extremal semifields instead of the trop-
ical semiring. To this end, we use the notion of
a maximal factorization, which is implicit in his
work. (ii) We consider weighted tree automata
instead of weighted string automata. This makes
the proof more complex, as we have to distinguish
between contexts and trees.
Kirsten?s result that deciding the twins property
is PSPACE-hard directly transfers to our setting,
giving a lower bound on the complexity of our al-
gorithms. In addition, he shows that the problem
is PSPACE-complete by giving an algorithm that
is in PSPACE. We did not investigate whether this
result can be transferred to our setting as well.
To check for critical vectors, Algorithm 1 does
not need all components from the vectors in Tp,q
but only the p- and q?-components; thus in the
proof of Lemma 3.3 the height restriction ht(?) ?
2|Q|2|Q| for S? can ultimately be lowered to
ht(?) ? 2|Q|2. It is an open question which of
the two algorithms performs better in practice.
For further research, it would be interesting
to investigate sufficient properties for determiniz-
ability that do not require the semifield to be ex-
tremal. Then the determinized wta could truly ag-
gregate the weights of the original runs.
