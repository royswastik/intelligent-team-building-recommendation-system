Abstract 
We describe a new corpus of over 180,000 hand-
annotated dialog act tags and accompanying adjacency 
pair annotations for roughly 72 hours of speech from 75 
naturally-occurring meetings. We provide a brief sum-
mary of the annotation system and labeling procedure, 
inter-annotator reliability statistics, overall distributional 
statistics, a description of auxiliary files distributed with 
the corpus, and information on how to obtain the data.  
1 Introduction 
Natural meetings offer rich opportunities for studying a 
variety of complex discourse phenomena. Meetings 
contain regions of high speaker overlap, affective varia-
tion, complicated interaction structures, abandoned or 
interrupted utterances, and other interesting turn-taking 
and discourse-level phenomena. In addition, meetings 
that occur naturally involve real topics, debates, issues, 
and social dynamics that should generalize more readily 
to other real meetings than might data collected using 
artificial scenarios. Thus meetings pose interesting chal-
lenges to descriptive and theoretical models of dis-
course, as well as to researchers in the speech 
recognition community [4,7,9,13,14,15]. 
 
We describe a new corpus of hand-annotated dialog acts 
and adjacency pairs for roughly 72 hours of naturally 
occurring multi-party meetings. The meetings were re-
corded at the International Computer Science Institute 
(ICSI) as part of the ICSI Meeting Recorder Project [9]. 
Word transcripts and audio files from that corpus are 
available through the Linguistic Data Consortium 
(LDC). In this paper, we provide a first description of 
the meeting recorder dialog act (MRDA) corpus, a 
companion set of annotations that augment the word 
transcriptions with discourse-level segmentations, dia-
log act (DA) information, and adjacency pair informa-
tion. The corpus is currently available online for 
research purposes [16], and we plan a future release 
through the LDC. 
2 Data 
The ICSI Meeting Corpus data is described in detail in 
[9]. It consists of 75 meetings, each roughly an hour in 
length. There are 53 unique speakers in the corpus, and 
an average of about 6 speakers per meeting.  Reflecting 
the makeup of the Institute, there are more male than 
female speakers (40 and 13, respectively).  There are 
a28 native English speakers, although many of the 
nonnative English speakers are quite fluent. Of the 75 
meetings, 29 are meetings of the ICSI meeting recorder 
project itself, 23 are meetings of a research group 
focused on robustness in automatic speech recognition, 
15 involve a group discussing natural language 
processing and neural theories of language, and 8 are 
miscellaneous meeting types.  The last set includes 2 
very interesting meetings involving the corpus 
transcribers as participants (example included in [16]). 
3 Annotation 
Annotation involved three types of information: 
marking of DA segment boundaries, marking of DAs 
themselves, and marking of correspondences between 
DAs (adjacency pairs, [12]).  Each type of annotation is 
described in detail in [7].  Segmentation methods were 
developed based on separating out speech regions 
having different discourse functions, but also paying 
attention to pauses and intonational grouping. To 
distinguish utterances that are prosodically one unit but 
which contain multiple DAs, we use a pipe bar ( | ) in 
the annotations. This allows the researcher to either split 
or not split at the bar, depending on the research goals. 
 
We examined existing annotation systems, including  
[1,2,5,6,8,10,11], for similarity to the style of interaction 
in the ICSI meetings. We found that SWBD-DAMSL 
[11], a system adapted from DAMSL [6], provided a 
fairly good fit. Although our meetings were natural, and 
thus had real agenda items, the dialog was less like 
human-human or human-machine task-oriented dialog 
(e.g., [1,2,10]) and more like human-human casual 
conversation  ([5,6,8,11]). Since we were working with 
English rather than Spanish, and did not view a large tag 
set as a problem, we preferred [6,11] over [5,8] for this 
work. We modified the system in [11] a number of 
ways, as indicated in Figure 1 and as explained further 
in [7]. The MRDA system requires one ?general tag? 
per DA, and attaches a variable number of following 
?specific tags?. Excluding nonlabelable cases, there are 
11 general tags and 39 specific tags. There are two dis-
ruption forms (%-, %--), two types of indecipherable 
utterances (x, %) and a non-DA tag to denote rising tone 
(rt).   
 
An interface allowed annotators to play regions of 
speech, modify transcripts, and enter DA and adjacency 
pair information, as well as other comments. Meetings 
were divided into 10 minute chunks; labeling time aver-
aged about 3 hours per chunk, although this varied con-
siderably depending on the complexity of the dialog.  
 
4 Annotated Example  
An example from one of the meetings is shown in Fig-
ure 2 as an illustration of some of the types of interac-
tions we observe in the corpus. Audio files and 
additional sample excerpts are available from [16]. In 
addition to the obvious high degree of overlap?roughly 
one third of all words are overlapped?note the explicit 
struggle for the floor indicated by the two failed floor 
grabbers (fg) by speakers c5 and c6. Furthermore, 6 of 
the 19 total utterances express some form of agreement 
or disagreement (arp, aa, and nd) with previous utter-
ances. Also, of the 19 utterances within the excerpt, 9 
are incomplete due to interruption by another talker, as 
is typical of many regions in the corpus showing high 
speaker overlap. We find in related work that regions of 
high overlap correlate with high speaker involvement, 
or ?hot spots? [15].  The example also provides a taste 
of the frequency and complexity of adjacency pair in-
formation. For example, within only half a minute, 
speaker c5 has interacted with speakers c3 and c6, and 
speaker c6 has interacted with speakers c2 and c5.   
 
5 Reliability 
We computed interlabeler reliability among the three 
labelers for both segmentation (into DA units) and DA 
labeling, using randomly selected excerpts from the 75 
labeled meetings.  Since agreement on DA segmentation 
does not appear to have standard associated metrics in 
the literature, we developed our own approach. The 
philosophy is that any difference in words at the 
beginning and/or end of a DA could result in a different 
label for that DA, and the more words that are 
mismatched, the more likely the difference in label. As 
a very strict measure of reliability, we used the

Figure 1: Mapping of MRDA tags to SWBD-DAMSL tags. Tags in boldface are not present in SWBD-DAMSL and were 
added in MRDA. Tags in italics are based on the SWBD-DAMSL version but have had meanings modified for MRDA. The 
ordering of tags in the table is explained as follows: In the mapping of DAMSL tags to SWBD-DAMSL tags in the SWBD-
DAMSL manual, tags were ordered in categories such as ?Communication Status?, ?Information Requests?, and so on.  In 
the mapping of MRDA tags to SWBD-DAMSL tags here, we have retained the same overall ordering of tags within the table, 
but we do not explicitly mark the higher-level SWBD-DAMSL categories in order to avoid confusion, since categorical 
structure differs in the two systems (see [7]). 
following approach: (1) Take one labeler?s transcript as 
a reference. (2) Look at each other labeler?s words. For 
each word, look at the utterance it comes from and see if 
the reference has the exact same utterance. (3) If it does, 
there is a match. Match every word in the utterance, and 
then mark the matched utterance in the reference so it 
cannot be matched again (this prevents felicitous 
matches due to identical repeated words). (4) Repeat 
this process for each word in each reference-labeler 
pair, and rotate to the next labeler as the reference. Note 
that this metric requires perfect matching of the full 
utterance a word is in for that word to be matched.  For 
example in the following case, labelers agree on 3 seg-
mentation locations, but the agreement on our metric is 
only 0.14, since only 1 of 7 words is matched: 
 
.  yeah  .  I agree     it?s a hard decision . 
.  yeah  .  I agree  .  it?s a hard decision . 
 
Overall segmentation results on this metric are provided 
by labeler pair in Table 1. 
 
We examined agreement on DA labels using the Kappa  
statistic [3], which adjusts for chance agreement. 
Because of the large number of unique full label 
combinations, we report Kappa values in Table 2 using 
various class mappings distributed with the corpus. 
Values are shown by labeler pair.

6 Distributional Statistics 
We provide basic statistics based on the dialog act 
labels for the 75 meetings. If we ignore the tag marking 
rising intonation (rt), since this is not a DA tag, we find 
180,218 total tags. Table 3 shows the distribution of the 
tags in more detail.

If instead we look at only the 11 obligatory general tags, 
for which there is one per DA, and if we split labels at 
the pipe bar, the total is 113,560 (excluding tags that 
only include a disruption label).  The distribution of 
general tags is shown in Table 4.

7 Auxiliary Information 
We include other useful information with the corpus.  
Word-level time information is available, based on 
alignments from an automatic speech recognizer. 
Annotator comments are also provided. We suggest 
various ways to group the large set of labels into a 
smaller set of classes, depending on the research focus. 
Finally, the corpus contains information that may be 
useful in for developing automatic modeling of prosody, 
such as hand-marked annotation of rising intonation.
