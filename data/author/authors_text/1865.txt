Abstract
We study the correlations in the connec-
tivity patterns of large scale syntactic de-
pendency networks. These networks are
induced from treebanks: their vertices de-
note word forms which occur as nuclei
of dependency trees. Their edges con-
nect pairs of vertices if at least two in-
stance nuclei of these vertices are linked
in the dependency structure of a sentence.
We examine the syntactic dependency net-
works of seven languages. In all these
cases, we consistently obtain three find-
ings. Firstly, clustering, i.e., the probabil-
ity that two vertices which are linked to
a common vertex are linked on their part,
is much higher than expected by chance.
Secondly, the mean clustering of vertices
decreases with their degree ? this find-
ing suggests the presence of a hierarchical
network organization. Thirdly, the mean
degree of the nearest neighbors of a ver-
tex x tends to decrease as the degree of
x grows ? this finding indicates disassor-
tative mixing in the sense that links tend
to connect vertices of dissimilar degrees.
Our results indicate the existence of com-
mon patterns in the large scale organiza-
tion of syntactic dependency networks.
1 Introduction
During the last decade, the study of the statisti-
cal properties of networks as different as technical,
biological and social networks has grown tremen-
dously. See (Baraba?si and Albert, 2002; Dorogovt-
sev and Mendes, 2002; Newman, 2003) for a review.
Among themmany kinds of linguistic networks have
been studied: e.g., free word association networks
(Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005), syllable networks
(Soares et al, 2005), thesaurus networks (Sigman
65
and Cecchi, 2002), and document networks (Mehler,
2006). See (Mehler, 2007a) for a review of linguis-
tic network studies. Here we focus on the so called
global syntactic dependency networks (GSDN) (Fer-
rer i Cancho et al, 2004; Ferrer i Cancho, 2005).
A GSDN is induced from a dependency treebank in
two steps:
1. The vertices of the network are obtained from
the word forms appearing as nuclei in the in-
put treebank and from punctuation marks as far
as they have been annotated and mapped onto
dependency trees. The notion of a nucleus is
adapted from Lucien Tesnie`re: a nucleus is a
node of a dependency tree. Note that multipart
nuclei may also occur. We use the term type
in order to denote word forms and punctuation
marks. The reason that we induce vertices from
types, but not from lexemes, is that not all cor-
pora are lemmatized. Thus, the type level is the
least common denominator which allows com-
paring the different networks. Note also that a
systematization of the corpora with respect to
the inclusion of punctuation marks is needed.
2. Two vertices (i.e. types) of a GSDN are con-
nected if there is at least one dependency tree in
which their corresponding instance nuclei are
linked. When it comes to applying the appa-
ratus of complex network theory, the arc direc-
tion is generally disregarded (Newman, 2003).
Thus, GSDNs are simple undirected graphs
without loops or multiple edges.
The attribute ?global? distinguishes macroscopic
syntactic dependency networks from their micro-
scopic counterparts in the form of syntactic depen-
dency structures of single sentences. The latter are
the usual object of dependency grammars and re-
lated formalisms. The goal of this article is to shed
light on the large-scale organization of syntactic de-
pendency structures. In terms of theoretical linguis-
tics, we aim to determine the statistical properties
that are common to all languages (if they exist), the
ones that are not and to explain our findings. To
achieve this goal, we must overcome the limits of
many studies of linguistic networks. Firstly, by us-
ing GSDNs we intend to solve the problems of co-
occurrence networks in which words are linked if
they (a) are adjacent, (b) co-occur within a short
window (Ferrer i Cancho and Sole?, 2001; Milo et al,
2004; Antiqueira et al, 2006; Masucci and Rodgers,
2006) or (c) appear in the same sentence (Caldeira
et al, 2006). This approach is problematic: with
a couple of exceptions (Bordag et al, 2003; Fer-
rer i Cancho and Sole?, 2001), no attempt is made
to filter out statistically insignificant co-occurrences.
Unfortunately the filter used in (Ferrer i Cancho
and Sole?, 2001) is not well-defined because it does
not consider fluctuations of the frequencies of word
co-occurrences. (Bordag et al, 2003) implement
a collocation measure based on the Poisson distri-
bution and, thus, induce collocation instead of co-
occurrence networks. However, the notion of a sen-
tence window and related notions are problematic as
the probability that two words depend syntactically
decays exponentially with the number of intermedi-
ate words (Ferrer i Cancho, 2004). Further, (Ferrer
i Cancho et al, 2004) shows that the proportion of
syntactically wrong links captured from a sentence
by linking adjacent words is about 0.3 while this
proportion is about 0.5 when linking a word to its
1st and 2nd neighbors. Thus, dependency treebanks
offer connections between words that are linguisti-
cally precise according to a dependency grammar
formalism. Secondly, the majority of linguistic net-
work studies is performed on English only ? with
some exceptions (Soares et al, 2005; Ferrer i Can-
cho et al, 2004; Mehler, 2006). Concerning GS-
DNs, (Ferrer i Cancho et al, 2004) considers three
languages but the syntactic dependency information
of sentences is systematically incomplete in two of
them. Here we aim to use complete treebanks and
analyze more (i.e. seven) languages so that we can
obtain stronger conclusions about the common sta-
tistical patterns of GSDNs than in (Ferrer i Cancho
et al, 2004).
Therefore, this article is about statistical regulari-
ties of the organization of GSDNs. These networks
are analyzed with the help of complex network the-
ory and, thus by means of quantitative graph the-
ory. We hypothesize that GSDNs are homoge-
neous in terms of their network characteristics while
they differ from non-syntactic networks. The long-
term objective to analyze such distinctive features
is to explore quality criteria of dependency tree-
banks which allow separating high quality annota-
66
tions from erroneous ones.
The remainder of this article is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 introduces the statistical measures
that will be used for studying GSDNs of seven lan-
guages. Section 3 presents the treebanks and their
unified representations from which we induce these
networks. Section 4 shows the results and Section 5
discusses them.
2 The statistical measures
Two essential properties of a network are N , the
number of vertices (i.e. the number of types), and k?
the mean vertex degree (Baraba?si and Albert, 2002).
The literature about distinctive indices and distribu-
tions of complex networks is huge. Here we focus
on correlations in the network structure (Serrano et
al., 2006). The reason is that correlation analysis
provides a deeper understanding of network orga-
nization compared to classical aggregative ?small-
world? indices. For instance, two networks may
have the same degree distribution (whose similarity
is measured by the exponent of power laws fitted to
them) while they differ in the degree correlation of
the vertices forming a link. Correlation analysis is
performed as follows: We define p(k) as the propor-
tion of vertices with degree k. Here we study three
measures of correlation (Serrano et al, 2006):
? k?nn(k) is the average degree of the nearest
neighbors of the vertices with degree k (Pastor-
Satorras et al, 2001). If k?nn(k) tends to grow
as k grows the network is said to exhibit assor-
tative mixing. In this case, edges tend to con-
nect vertices of similar degree. If in contrast to
this k?nn(k) tends to shrink as k grows, the net-
work is said to exhibit disassortative mixing. In
this case, edges tend to connect vertices of dis-
similar degree. If there are no correlations, then
k?nn(k) = ? with ? =
?
k2
?
/ ?k?; ?k? = k? is
the 1st and
?
k2
?
the 2nd moment of the degree
distribution, namely
?k? =
N?1?
k=1
kp(k) (1)
?
k2
?
=
N?1?
k=1
k2p(k). (2)
In order to enable comparisons of different net-
works, k?nn(k) is normalized using ? and re-
placed by k?nn(k)/?.
? c?(k) is the mean clustering coefficient of ver-
tices of degree k. The clustering coefficient of
a vertex is defined as the proportion of pairs of
adjacent vertices (u, v) such that u and v are
linked.
? c? is the mean clustering coefficient defined as
c? =
N?1?
k=1
p(k)c?(k). (3)
In order to test the significance of c?, we calcu-
late c?binom = k?/(N ? 1), the expected cluster-
ing coefficient in a control binomial graph. In
a binomial graph, two vertices are linked with
probability p. p = k?/(N ? 1) is chosen so that
the expected number of links of the binomial
graphs is nk?/2 as in the original network.
Assortative mixing is known to be characteristic
for social-semiotic, but not for technical networks
(Newman, 2003). Recently, (Mehler, 2006) has
shown that this characteristic varies a lot for differ-
ent document networks and thus allows distinguish-
ing linguistic networks which are homogeneously
called ?small-worlds?. We have excluded on purpose
the Pearson correlation coefficient of the degrees at
the endpoints of edges that has been used in previous
studies (Ferrer i Cancho et al, 2004) due to the sta-
tistical problems that this measure has in large net-
works with power degree distributions (Serrano et
al., 2006).
3 The treebanks
We analyze seven treebanks each from a different
language. Their features are summarized in Table
1. A comprehensive description of these and re-
lated banks is given by (Kakkonen, 2005). As ex-
plained by Kakkonen, one generally faces the prob-
lem of the heterogeneity not only of the annotation
schemes, but also of the serialization formats used
by them. Thus, we unified the various formats in or-
der to get a single interface to the analysis of syntac-
tic dependency networks derived thereof. Although
67
there exists a representation format for syntactic an-
notations (i.e. TIGER-XML? cf. (Mengel and Lez-
ius, 2000)) we decided to use the Graph eXchange
Language (GXL) in order to solve the heterogeneity
problem. The GXL has been proposed as a uniform
format for data interchange (Holt et al, 2006). It
allows representing attributed, directed, undirected,
mixed, ordered, hierarchical graphs as well as hyper-
graphs. Its application-dependent attribution model
concerns vertices, edges and graphs. Because of
its expressiveness it was utilized in modeling con-
stituency structures (Pustylnikov, 2006) as well as
nonlinear document structures (Mehler, 2007b). We
utilize it to map syntactic dependency structures.
Our GXL binding is schematically explained as
follows: corpora are mapped onto graphs which se-
rialize graph models of sentence-related dependency
structures. Each of these structures is mapped as a
forest whose directed edges are mapped by means
of the GXL?s edge model. This model preserves the
orientation of the input dependency relations. Figure
1 visualizes a sample dependency tree of the Slovene
dependency treebank (Dz?eroski et al, 2006).

Slovene dependency treebank (Dz?eroski et al, 2006)
based on its reconstruction in terms of the GXL.
4 Results
A summary of the network measures obtained on the
seven corpora is shown in Table 2. We find that
c?  c?binom indicating a clear tendency of vertices
connected to be connected if they are linked to the
same vertex.
Since the Italian and the Romanian corpus are
Romanic languages and the size of their networks
is similar, they are paired in the figures. Figure 2
shows that the clustering c?(k) decreases as k in-
creases. Figure 3 shows that k?nn(k) decreases as
k increases, indicating the presence of disassortative
mixing when forming links, i.e. links tend to com-
bine vertices of dissimilar degrees. For sufficiently
large k the curves suggest a power-law behavior, i.e.
k?nn(k) ? k??.
5 Discussion
We have found that the behavior of k?nn(k) suggests
k?nn(k) ? k?? for sufficiently large k. A power-law
behavior has been found in technical systems (Ser-
rano et al, 2006). In a linguistic context, a power-
law like behavior with two regimes has been found
in the word adjacency network examined in (Ma-
succi and Rodgers, 2006). A decreasing k?nn(k) for
growing k (an indicator of dissortative mixing) has
been found in biological and social systems (Serrano
et al, 2006). A decreasing c?(k) for growing k has
been found in many non-linguistic systems (e.g. the
Internet map at the autonomous system level), and
also in a preliminary study of Czech and German
syntactic dependency networks (Ferrer i Cancho et
al., 2004). (Ravasz and Baraba?si, 2003) suggest
that this behavior indicates the existence of a hierar-
chical network organization (Ravasz and Baraba?si,
2003). In our case this may indicate the existence
of a core vocabulary surrounded by more and more
special vocabularies. This observation is in accor-
dance with a multipart organization of the rank fre-
quency distribution of the lexical units involved. But
this stratification is not simply due to the words?
collocation patterns, but to their behavior in syntac-
tic dependency structures. We have also found that
c?  c?binom, which is a common feature of non-
linguistic (Newman, 2003) and linguistic networks
(Mehler, 2007a) and, thus, is not very informative.
In sum, we have seen that GSDNs follow a com-
mon pattern of statistical correlations regardless of
the heterogeneity of the languages and annotation
criteria used. This suggests that the structure of
GSDNs may originate from language independent
principles. Since the correlational properties of GS-
DNs are not unique to these networks, our findings
suggest that these principles may also be common
to certain non-linguistic systems. Thus, in order to
make GSDNs distinguishable in terms of their char-
acteristics, finding more expressive network coeffi-
