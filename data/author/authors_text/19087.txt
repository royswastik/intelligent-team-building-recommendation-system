Abstract
In this paper, we propose a joint segmenta-
tion and classification framework for sen-
timent analysis. Existing sentiment clas-
sification algorithms typically split a sen-
tence as a word sequence, which does not
effectively handle the inconsistent senti-
ment polarity between a phrase and the
words it contains, such as ?not bad? and
?a great deal of ?. We address this issue
by developing a joint segmentation and
classification framework (JSC), which si-
multaneously conducts sentence segmen-
tation and sentence-level sentiment classi-
fication. Specifically, we use a log-linear
model to score each segmentation candi-
date, and exploit the phrasal information
of top-ranked segmentations as features to
build the sentiment classifier. A marginal
log-likelihood objective function is de-
vised for the segmentation model, which
is optimized for enhancing the sentiment
classification performance. The joint mod-
el is trained only based on the annotat-
ed sentiment polarity of sentences, with-
out any segmentation annotations. Experi-
ments on a benchmark Twitter sentimen-
t classification dataset in SemEval 2013
show that, our joint model performs com-
parably with the state-of-the-art methods.
1 Introduction
Sentiment classification, which classifies the senti-
ment polarity of a sentence (or document) as posi-
tive or negative, is a major research direction in the
field of sentiment analysis (Pang and Lee, 2008;
Liu, 2012; Feldman, 2013). Majority of existing
approaches follow Pang et al. (2002) and treat sen-

authors were visiting Microsoft Research.
timent classification as a special case of text cate-
gorization task. Under this perspective, previous
studies typically use pipelined methods with two
steps. They first produce sentence segmentation-
s with separate text analyzers (Choi and Cardie,
2008; Nakagawa et al., 2010; Socher et al., 2013b)
or bag-of-words (Paltoglou and Thelwall, 2010;
Maas et al., 2011). Then, feature learning and sen-
timent classification algorithms take the segmenta-
tion results as inputs to build the sentiment classi-
fier (Socher et al., 2011; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014;
Dong et al., 2014).
The major disadvantage of a pipelined method
is the problem of error propagation, since sen-
tence segmentation errors cannot be corrected by
the sentiment classification model. A typical kind
of error is caused by the polarity inconsistency be-
tween a phrase and the words it contains, such
as ?not bad, bad? and ?a great deal of, great?.
The segmentations based on bag-of-words or syn-
tactic chunkers are not effective enough to han-
dle the polarity inconsistency phenomenons. The
reason lies in that bag-of-words segmentations re-
gard each word as a separate unit, which losses
the word order and does not capture the phrasal
information. The segmentations based on syntac-
tic chunkers typically aim to identify noun group-
s, verb groups or named entities from a sentence.
However, many sentiment indicators are phrases
constituted of adjectives, negations, adverbs or id-
ioms (Liu, 2012; Mohammad et al., 2013a), which
are splitted by syntactic chunkers. Besides, a bet-
ter approach would be to utilize the sentiment in-
formation to improve the segmentor. Accordingly,
the sentiment-specific segmentor will enhance the
performance of sentiment classification in turn.
In this paper, we propose a joint segmentation
and classification framework (JSC) for sentimen-
t analysis, which simultaneous conducts sentence
segmentation and sentence-level sentiment clas-
sification. The framework is illustrated in Fig-

ure 1. We develop (1) a candidate generation mod-
el to generate the segmentation candidates of a
sentence, (2) a segmentation ranking model to s-
core each segmentation candidate of a given sen-
tence, and (3) a classification model to predic-
t the sentiment polarity of each segmentation. The
phrasal information of top-ranked candidates from
the segmentation model are utilized as features to
build the sentiment classifier. In turn, the predict-
ed sentiment polarity of segmentation candidates
from classification model are leveraged to update
the segmentor. We score each segmentation can-
didate with a log-linear model, and optimize the
segmentor with a marginal log-likelihood objec-
tive. We train the joint model from sentences an-
notated only with sentiment polarity, without any
segmentation annotations.
We evaluate the effectiveness of our joint mod-
el on a benchmark Twitter sentiment classifica-
tion dataset in SemEval 2013. Results show that
the joint model performs comparably with state-
of-the-art methods, and consistently outperforms
pipeline methods in various experiment settings.

this paper are as follows.

2 Related Work
Existing approaches for sentiment classification
are dominated by two mainstream directions.
Lexicon-based approaches (Turney, 2002; Ding
et al., 2008; Taboada et al., 2011; Thelwall et
al., 2012) typically utilize a lexicon of sentiment
words, each of which is annotated with the sen-
timent polarity or sentiment strength. Linguis-
tic rules such as intensifications and negations are
usually incorporated to aggregate the sentimen-
t polarity of sentences (or documents). Corpus-
based methods treat sentiment classification as a
special case of text categorization task (Pang et al.,
2002). They mostly build the sentiment classifier
from sentences (or documents) with manually an-
notated sentiment polarity or distantly-supervised
corpora collected by sentiment signals like emoti-
cons (Go et al., 2009; Pak and Paroubek, 2010;
Kouloumpis et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2012).
Majority of existing approaches follow Pang et
al. (2002) and employ corpus-based method for
sentiment classification. Pang et al. (2002) pi-
oneer to treat the sentiment classification of re-
views as a special case of text categorization prob-
lem and first investigate machine learning meth-
ods. They employ Naive Bayes, Maximum En-
tropy and Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a
diverse set of features. In their experiments, the
best performance is achieved by SVM with bag-
of-words feature. Under this perspective, many s-
tudies focus on designing or learning effective fea-
tures to obtain better classification performance.
On movie or product reviews, Wang and Man-
ning (2012) present NBSVM, which trades-off
478
between Naive Bayes and NB-feature enhanced
SVM. Kim and Zhai (2009) and Paltoglou and
Thelwall (2010) learn the feature weights by in-
vestigating variants weighting functions from In-
formation Retrieval. Nakagawa et al. (2010) uti-
lize dependency trees, polarity-shifting rules and
conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001)
with hidden variables to compute the documen-
t feature. On Twitter, Mohammad et al. (2013b)
develop a state-of-the-art Twitter sentiment classi-
fier in SemEval 2013, using a variety of sentiment
lexicons and hand-crafted features.
With the revival of deep learning (representa-
tion learning (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006;
Bengio et al., 2013; Jones, 2014)), more recen-
t studies focus on learning the low-dimensional,
dense and real-valued vector as text features for
sentiment classification. Glorot et al. (2011) inves-
tigate Stacked Denoising Autoencoders to learn
document vector for domain adaptation in sen-
timent classification. Yessenalina and Cardie
(2011) represent each word as a matrix and
compose words using iterated matrix multipli-
cation. Socher et al. propose Recursive Au-
toencoder (RAE) (2011), Matrix-Vector Recursive
Neural Network (MV-RNN) (2012) and Recur-
sive Neural Tensor Network (RNTN) (2013b) to
learn the composition of variable-length phrases
based on the representation of its children. To
learn the sentence representation, Kalchbrenner et
al. (2014) exploit Dynamic Convolutional Neu-
ral Network and Le and Mikolov (2014) inves-
tigate Paragraph Vector. To learn word vectors
for sentiment analysis, Maas et al. (2011) propose
a probabilistic document model following Blei et
al. (2003), Labutov and Lipson (2013) re-embed
words from existing word embeddings and Tang
et al. (2014b) develop three neural networks to
learn word vectors from tweets containing posi-
tive/negative emoticons.
Unlike most previous corpus-based algorithms
that build sentiment classifier based on splitting a
sentence as a word sequence, we produce sentence
segmentations automatically within a joint frame-
work, and conduct sentiment classification based
on the segmentation results.
3 The Proposed Approach
In this section, we first give the task definition
of two tasks, namely sentiment classification and
sentence segmentation. Then, we present the
overview of the proposed joint segmentation and
classification model (JSC) for sentiment analysis.
The segmentation candidate generation model and
the segmentation ranking model are described in
Section 4. The details of the sentiment classifica-
tion model are presented in Section 5.
3.1 Task Definition
The task of sentiment classification has been well
formalized in previous studies (Pang and Lee,
2008; Liu, 2012). The objective is to identify the
sentiment polarity of a sentence (or document) as
positive or negative
1
.
The task of sentence segmentation aims to s-
plit a sentence into a sequence of exclusive part-
s, each of which is a basic computational unit of
the sentence. An example is illustrated in Table 1.
The original text ?that is not bad? is segmented
as ?[that] [is] [not bad]?. The segmentation re-
sult is composed of three basic computational u-
nits, namely [that], [is] and [not bad].
Type Sample
Sentence that is not bad
Segmentation [that] [is] [not bad]
Basic units [that], [is], [not bad]
Table 1: Example for sentence segmentation.
3.2 Joint Model (JSC)
The overview of the proposed joint segmentation
and classification model (JSC) for sentiment anal-
ysis is illustrated in Figure 1. The intuitions of the
joint model are two-folds:
? The segmentation results have a strong influ-
ence on the sentiment classification perfor-
mance, since they are the inputs of the sen-
timent classification model.
? The usefulness of a segmentation can be
judged by whether the sentiment classifier
can use it to predict the correct sentence po-
larity.
Based on the mutual influence observation, we
formalize the joint model in Algorithm 1. The in-
puts contain two parts, training data and feature
extractors. Each sentence s
i
in the training data
1
In this paper, the sentiment polarity of a sentence is not
relevant to the target (or aspect) it contains (Hu and Liu, 2004;
Jiang et al., 2011; Mitchell et al., 2013).

T is annotated only with its gold sentiment po-

s. There are two feature extractors for the task
of sentence segmentation (sfe(?)) and sentiment
classification (cfe(?)), respectively. The output-
s of the joint model are the segmentation ranking
model SEG and the sentiment classifier SC.
In Algorithm 1, we first generate segmentation
candidates ?
i
for each sentence s
i
in the training
set (line 1). Each ?
i
contains no less than one
segmentation candidates. We randomly select one
segmentation result from each ?
i
and utilize their
classification features to initialize the sentimen-
t classifier SC
(0)
(line 2). We randomly initialize
the segmentation model SEG
(0)
(line 3). Subse-
quently, we iteratively train the segmentation mod-
el SEG
(r)
and sentiment classifier SC
(r)
in a join-
t manner (line 4-12). At each iteration, we pre-
dict the sentiment polarity of each segmentation
candidate ?
i?
with the current sentiment classifi-
er SC
(r?1)
(line 5), and then leverage them to up-
date the segmentation model SEG
(r)
(line 6). Af-
terwards, we utilize the recently updated segmen-
tation ranking model SEG
(r)
to update the senti-
ment classifier SC
(r)
(line 7-11). We extract the
segmentation features for each segmentation can-
didate ?
i?
, and employ them to calculate the seg-
mentation score (line 8). The top-ranked K seg-
mentation results ?
i?
of each sentence s
i
is select-
ed (line 9), and further used to train the sentimen-
t classifier SC
(r)
(line 11). Finally, after training
R iterations, we dump the segmentation ranking
model SEG
(R)
and sentiment classifier SC
(R)
in
the last iteration as outputs (line 13-14).
At training time, we train the segmentation
model and classification model from sentences
with manually annotated sentiment polarity. At
prediction time, given a test sentence, we gener-
ate its segmentation candidates, and then calculate
segmentation score for each candidate. Afterward-
s, we select the top-ranked K candidates and vote
their predicted sentiment polarity from sentiment
classifier as the final result.
4 Segmentation Model
In this section, we present details of the segmenta-
tion candidate generation model (Section 4.1), the
segmentation ranking model (Section 4.2) and the
feature description for segmentation ranking mod-
el (Section 4.3).
4.1 Segmentation Candidate Generation
In this subsection, we describe the strategy to gen-
erate segmentation candidates for each sentence.
Since the segmentation results have an exponen-
tial search space in the number of words in a
sentence, we approximate the computation using
beam search with constrains on a phrase table,
which is induced from massive corpora.
Many studies have been previously proposed to
recognize phrases in the text. However, it is out
of scope of this work to compare them. We ex-
ploit a data-driven approach given by Mikolov et
al. (2013), which identifies phrases based on the
occurrence frequency of unigrams and bigrams,
freq(w
i
, w
j
) =
freq(w
i
, w
j
)? ?
freq(w
i
)? freq(w
j
)
(1)
480
where ? is a discounting coefficient that prevents
too many phrases consisting of very infrequen-
t words. We run 2-4 times over the corpora to get
longer phrases containing more words. We em-
pirically set ? as 10 in our experiment. We use
the default frequency threshold (value=5) in the
word2vec toolkit
2
to select bi-terms.
Given a sentence, we initialize the beam of each
index with the current word, and sequentially add
phrases into the beam if the new phrase is con-
tained in the phrase table. At each index of a sen-
tence, we rank the segmentation candidates by the
inverted number of items within a segmentation,
and save the top-ranked N segmentation candi-
dates into the beam. An example of the generated
segmentation candidates is given in Table 2.
Type Sample
Sentence that is not bad
Phrase Table [is not], [not bad], [is not bad]
Segmentations
[that] [is not bad]
[that] [is not] [bad]
[that] [is] [not bad]
[that] [is] [not] [bad]
Table 2: Example for segmentation candidate gen-
eration.
4.2 Segmentation Ranking Model
The objective of the segmentation ranking model
is to assign a scalar to each segmentation candi-
date, which indicates the usefulness of the seg-
mentation result for sentiment classification. In
this subsection, we describe a log-linear model to
calculate the segmentation score. To effectively
train the segmentation ranking model, we devise a
marginal log-likelihood as the optimization objec-
tive.
Given a segmentation candidate ?
ij
of the sen-
tence s
i
, we calculate the segmentation score
for ?
ij
with a log-linear model, as given in Equa-
tion 2.
?
ij
= exp(b+
?
k
sfe
ijk
? w

) (2)
where ?
ij
is the segmentation score of ?
ij
; sfe
ijk
is the k-th segmentation feature of ?
ij
; w and b are
the parameters of the segmentation ranking model.
During training, given a sentence s
i
and its gold
sentiment polarity pol
g
i
, the optimization objec-
2
Available at https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/
tive of the segmentation ranking model is to max-
imize the segmentation scores of the hit candi-
dates, whose predicted sentiment polarity equal-
s to the gold polarity of sentence pol
p
i
. The loss
function of the segmentation model is given in E-
quation 3.

represents all the
segmentation candidates of sentence s

; H

mean-

i
; ? is the weight of the
L2-norm regularization factor. We train the seg-
mentation model with L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal,
1989), running over the complete training data.
4.3 Feature
We design two kinds of features for sentence seg-
mentation, namely the phrase-embedding feature
and the segmentation-specific feature. The final
feature representation of each segmentation is the
concatenation of these two features. It is worth
noting that, the phrase-embedding feature is used
in both sentence segmentation and sentiment clas-
sification.
Segmentation-Specific Feature We empirically
design four segmentation-specific features to re-
flect the information of each segmentation, as list-
ed in Table 3.
Phrase-Embedding Feature We leverage
phrase embedding to generate the features of
segmentation candidates for both sentence seg-
mentation and sentiment classification. The
reason is that, in both tasks, the basic compu-
tational units of each segmentation candidate
might be words or phrases of variable length.
Under this scenario, phrase embedding is highly
suitable as it is capable to represent phrases with
different length into a consistent distributed vector
space (Mikolov et al., 2013). For each phrase,
phrase embedding is a dense, real-valued and
continuous vector. After the phrase embedding is
trained, the nearest neighbors in the embedding
space are favored to have similar grammatical us-
ages and semantic meanings. The effectiveness of
phrase embedding has been verified for building
large-scale sentiment lexicon (Tang et al., 2014a)
and machine translation (Zhang et al., 2014).
We learn phrase embedding with Skip-Gram
model (Mikolov et al., 2013), which is the state-of-
481
Feature Feature Description
#unit the number of basic computation units in the segmentation candidate

the-art phrase embedding learning algorithm. We
compose the representation (or feature) of a seg-
mentation candidate from the embedding of the
basic computational units (words or phrases) it
contains. In this paper, we explore min, max and
average convolution functions, which have been
used as simple and effective methods for composi-
tion learning in vector-based semantics (Mitchell
and Lapata, 2010; Collobert et al., 2011; Socher et
al., 2013a; Shen et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2014b),
to calculate the representation of a segmentation
candidate. The final phrase-embedding feature is
the concatenation of vectors derived from different
convolutional functions, as given in Equation 4,
pf(seg) = [pf
max
(seg), pf
min
(seg), pf
avg
(seg)]
(4)
where pf(seg) is the representation of the given
segmentation; pf
x
(seg) is the result of the con-
volutional function x ? {min,max, avg}. Each
convolutional function pf
x
(?) conducts the matrix-
vector operation of x on the sequence represented
by columns in the lookup table of phrase embed-
ding. The output of pf
x

pf

L

5 Classification Model
For sentiment classification, we follow the su-
pervised learning framework (Pang et al., 2002)
and build the classifier from sentences with man-
ually labelled sentiment polarity. We extend the
state-of-the-art hand-crafted features in SemEval
2013 (Mohammad et al., 2013b), and design the
classification-specific features for each segmenta-
tion. The detailed feature description is given in
Table 4.
6 Experiment
In this section, we conduct experiments to evaluate
the effectiveness of the joint model. We describe
the experiment settings and the result analysis.
6.1 Dataset and Experiment Settings
We conduct sentiment classification of tweets on a
benchmark Twitter sentiment classification dataset
in SemEval 2013. We run 2-class (positive vs neg-
ative) classification as sentence segmentation has a
great influence on the positive/negative polarity of
tweets due to the polarity inconsistency between a
phrase and its constitutes, such as ?not bad, bad?.
482
We leave 3-class classification (positive, negative,
neutral) and fine-grained classification (very neg-
ative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive) in
the future work.

The statistics of our dataset crawled from Se-
mEval 2013 are given in Table 5. The evalua-
tion metric is the macro-F1 of sentiment classifi-
cation. We train the joint model on the training
set, tune parameters on the dev set and evaluate
on the test set. We train the sentiment classifier
with LibLinear (Fan et al., 2008) and utilize exist-
ing sentiment lexicons
3
to extract classification-
specific features. We randomly crawl 100M tweets
from February 1st, 2013 to April 30th, 2013 with
Twitter API, and use them to learn the phrase em-
bedding with Skip-Gram
4
. The vocabulary size
of the phrase embedding is 926K, from unigram
to 5-gram. The parameter -c in SVM is tuned on
the dev-set in both baseline and our method. We
run the L-BFGS for 50 iterations, and set the reg-
ularization factor ? as 0.003. The beam size N of
the candidate generation model and the top-ranked
segmentation number K are tuned on the dev-set.
6.2 Baseline Methods
We compare the proposed joint model with the fol-
lowing sentiment classification algorithms:
? DistSuper: We collect 10M balanced tweets
selected by positive and negative emoticons
5
as
training data, and build classifier using the Lib-
Linear and ngram features (Go et al., 2009; Zhao
et al., 2012).
? SVM: The n-gram features and Support Vec-
tor Machine are widely-used baseline methods to
build sentiment classifiers (Pang et al., 2002). We
use LibLinear to train the SVM classifier.
3
In this work, we use HL (Hu and Liu, 2004), M-
PQA (Wilson et al., 2005), NRC Emotion Lexicon (Moham-
mad and Turney, 2012), NRC Hashtag Lexicon and Senti-
ment140Lexicon (Mohammad et al., 2013b).
4
https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/
5
We use the emoticons selected by Hu et al. (2013). The
positive emoticons are :) : ) :-) :D =), and the negative emoti-
cons are :( : ( :-( .
? NBSVM: NBSVM (Wang and Manning,
2012) trades-off between Naive Bayes and NB-
features enhanced SVM. We use NBSVM-bi be-
cause it performs best on sentiment classification
of reviews.
? RAE: Recursive Autoencoder (Socher et al.,
2011) has been proven effective for sentiment clas-
sification by learning sentence representation. We
train the RAE using the pre-trained phrase embed-
ding learned from 100M tweets.
? SentiStrength: Thelwall et al. (2012) build a
lexicon-based classifier which uses linguistic rules
to detect the sentiment strength of tweets.
? SSWE
u
: Tang et al. (2014b) propose to learn
sentiment-specific word embedding (SSWE) from
10M tweets collected by emoticons. They apply
SSWE as features for Twitter sentiment classifica-
tion.
? NRC: NRC builds the state-of-the-art system
in SemEval 2013 Twitter Sentiment Classifica-
tion Track, incorporating diverse sentiment lexi-
cons and hand-crafted features (Mohammad et al.,
2013b). We re-implement this system because the
codes are not publicly available. We do not di-
rectly report their results in the evaluation task,
as our training and development sets are smaller
than their dataset. In NRC + PF, We concatenate
the NRC features and the phrase embeddings fea-
ture (PF), and build the sentiment classifier with
LibLinear.
Except for DistSuper, other baseline method-
s are conducted in a supervised manner. We do
not compare with RNTN (Socher et al., 2013b) be-
cause the tweets in our dataset do not have accu-
rately parsed results. Another reason is that, due to
the differences between domains, the performance
of RNTN trained on movie reviews might be de-
creased if directly applied on the tweets (Xiao et
al., 2013).
6.3 Results and Analysis
Table 6 shows the macro-F1 of the baseline sys-
tems as well as our joint model (JSC) on senti-
ment classification of tweets (positive vs negative).
As is shown in Table 6, distant supervision is
relatively weak because the noisy-labeled tweets
are treated as the gold standard, which decreases
the performance of sentiment classifier. The result
of bag-of-unigram feature (74.50%) is not satisfied
as it losses the word order and does not well cap-

ture the semantic meaning of phrases. The integra-
tion of high-order n-ngram (up to 5-gram) does not
achieve significant improvement (+0.47%). The
reason is that, if a sentence contains a bigram ?not
bad?, they will use ?bad? and ?not bad? as par-
allel features, which confuses the sentiment clas-
sification model. NBSVM and Recursive Autoen-
coder perform comparatively and have a big gap
in comparison with JSC. In RAE, the representa-
tion of a sentence is composed from the represen-
tation of words it contains. Accordingly, ?great?
in ?a great deal of ? also contributes to the final
sentence representation via composition function.
JSC automatically conducts sentence segmenta-
tion by considering the sentiment polarity of sen-
tence, and utilize the phrasal information from the
segmentations. Ideally, JSC regards phrases like
?not bad? and ?a great deal of ? as basic compu-
tational units, and yields better classification per-
formance. JSC (85.51%) performs slightly better
than the state-of-the-art systems (SSWE
u
, 84.98%;
NRC+PF, 84.75%), which verifies its effective-
ness.
6.4 Comparing Joint and Pipelined Models
We compare the proposed joint model with
pipelined methods on Twitter sentiment classifi-
cation with different feature sets. Figure 2 gives
the experiment results. The tick [A, B] on x-
axis means the use of A as segmentation feature
and the use of B as classification feature. PF
represents the phrase-embedding feature; SF and
CF stand for the segmentation-specific feature and
classification-specific feature, respectively. We
use the bag-of-word segmentation result to build
sentiment classier in Pipeline 1, and use the seg-
mentation candidate with maximum phrase num-
ber in Pipeline 2.

Figure 2: Macro-F1 for positive vs negative classi-
fication of tweets with joint and pipelined models.
From Figure 2, we find that the joint model
consistently outperforms pipelined baseline meth-
ods in all feature settings. The reason is that
the pipelined methods suffer from error propaga-
tion, since the errors from linguistic-driven and
bag-of-word segmentations cannot be corrected by
the sentiment classification model. Besides, tra-
ditional segmentors do not update the segmenta-
tion model with the sentiment information of tex-
t. Unlike pipelined methods, the joint model is
capable to address these problems by optimizing
the segmentation model with the classification re-
sults in a joint framework, which yields better
performance on sentiment classification. We also
find that Pipeline 2 always outperforms Pipeline
1, which indicates the usefulness of phrase-based
segmentation for sentiment classification.
6.5 Effect of the beam size N
We investigate the influence of beam size N ,
which is the maximum number of segmentation
candidates of a sentence. In this part, we clamp the
feature set as [PF+SF, PF+CF], and vary the beam
size N in [1,2,4,8,16,32,64]. The experiment re-
sults of macro-F1 on the development set are il-
lustrated in Figure 3 (a). The time cost of each
training iteration is given in Figure 3 (b).
From Figure 3 (a), we can see that when larg-
er beam size is considered, the classification per-
formance is improved. When beam size is 1, the
model stands for the greedy search with the bag-
of-words segmentation. When the beam size is s-
mall, such as 2, beam search losses many phrasal
information of sentences and thus the improve-
ment is not significant. The performance remains
steady when beam size is larger than 16. From

It is intuitive as the joint model with larger beam
considers more segmentation results, which in-
creases the training time of the segmentation mod-
el. We set beam size as 16 after parameter learn-
ing.
6.6 Effect of the top-ranked segmentation
number K
We investigate how the top-ranked segmentation
number K affects the performance of sentimen-
t classification. In this part, we set the feature as
[PF+SF, PF+CF], and the beam size as 16. The
results of macro-F1 on the development set are il-
lustrated in Figure 4.

Figure 4: Sentiment classification of tweets with

From Figure 4, we find that the classification
performance increases with K being larger. The
reason is that when a larger K is used, (1) at train-
ing time, the sentiment classifier is built by using
more phrasal information from multiple segmen-
tations, which benefits from the ensembles; (2) at
test time, the joint model considers several top-
ranked segmentations and get the final sentiment
polarity through voting. The performance remain-
s stable when K is larger than 7, as the phrasal
information has been mostly covered.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we develop a joint segmentation
and classification framework (JSC) for sentiment
analysis. Unlike existing sentiment classification
algorithms that build sentiment classifier based
on the segmentation results from bag-of-words or
separate segmentors, the proposed joint model si-
multaneously conducts sentence segmentation and
sentiment classification. We introduce a marginal
log-likelihood function to optimize the segmenta-
tion model, and effectively train the joint mod-
el from sentences annotated only with sentiment
polarity, without segmentation annotations of sen-
tences. The effectiveness of the joint model has
been verified by applying it on the benchmark
dataset of Twitter sentiment classification in Se-
mEval 2013. Results show that, the joint model
performs comparably with state-of-the-art meth-
ods, and outperforms pipelined methods in various
settings. In the future, we plan to apply the join-
t model on other domains, such as movie/product
reviews.

Abstract
We propose Adaptive Recursive Neural
Network (AdaRNN) for target-dependent
Twitter sentiment classification. AdaRNN
adaptively propagates the sentiments of
words to target depending on the context
and syntactic relationships between them.
It consists of more than one composition
functions, and we model the adaptive sen-
timent propagations as distributions over
these composition functions. The experi-
mental studies illustrate that AdaRNN im-
proves the baseline methods. Further-
more, we introduce a manually annotated
dataset for target-dependent Twitter senti-
ment analysis.
1 Introduction
Twitter becomes one of the most popular social
networking sites, which allows the users to read
and post messages (i.e. tweets) up to 140 charac-
ters. Among the great varieties of topics, people
in Twitter tend to express their opinions for the
brands, celebrities, products and public events. As
a result, it attracts much attention to estimate the
crowd?s sentiments in Twitter.
For the tweets, our task is to classify their senti-
ments for a given target as positive, negative, and
neutral. People may mention several entities (or
targets) in one tweet, which affects the availabil-
ities for most of existing methods. For example,
the tweet ?@ballmer: windows phone is better
than ios!? has three targets (@ballmer, windows
phone, and ios). The user expresses neutral, pos-
itive, and negative sentiments for them, respec-
tively. If target information is ignored, it is diffi-
cult to obtain the correct sentiment for a specified
target. For target-dependent sentiment classifica-
tion, the manual evaluation of Jiang et al (2011)
?
Contribution during internship at Microsoft Research.
show that about 40% of errors are caused by not
considering the targets in classification.
The features used in traditional learning-based
methods (Pang et al, 2002; Nakagawa et al, 2010)
are independent to the targets, hence the results
are computed despite what the targets are. Hu and
Liu (2004) regard the features of products as tar-
gets, and sentiments for them are heuristically de-
termined by the dominant opinion words. Jiang
et al (2011) combine the target-independent fea-
tures (content and lexicon) and target-dependent
features (rules based on the dependency parsing
results) together in subjectivity classification and
polarity classification for tweets.
In this paper, we mainly focus on integrating
target information with Recursive Neural Network
(RNN) to leverage the ability of deep learning
models. The neural models use distributed repre-
sentation (Hinton, 1986; Rumelhart et al, 1986;
Bengio et al, 2003) to automatically learn fea-
tures for target-dependent sentiment classification.
RNN utilizes the recursive structure of text, and it
has achieved state-of-the-art sentiment analysis re-
sults for movie review dataset (Socher et al, 2012;
Socher et al, 2013). The recursive neural mod-
els employ the semantic composition functions,
which enables them to handle the complex com-
positionalities in sentiment analysis.
Specifically, we propose a framework which
learns to propagate the sentiments of words to-
wards the target depending on context and syn-
tactic structure. We employ a novel adaptive
multi-compositionality layer in recursive neural
network, which is named as AdaRNN (Dong et
al., 2014). It consists of more than one compo-
sition functions, and we model the adaptive sen-
timent propagations as learning distributions over
these composition functions. We automatically
learn the composition functions and how to select
them from supervisions, instead of choosing them
heuristically or by hand-crafted rules. AdaRNN
49
determines how to propagate the sentiments to-
wards the target and handles the negation or in-
tensification phenomena (Taboada et al, 2011) in
sentiment analysis. In addition, we introduce a
manually annotated dataset, and conduct extensive
experiments on it. The experimental results sug-
gest that our approach yields better performances
than the baseline methods.
2 RNN: Recursive Neural Network
RNN (Socher et al, 2011) represents the phrases
and words as D-dimensional vectors. It performs
compositions based on the binary trees, and obtain
the vector representations in a bottom-up way.

the vectors of ?not? and ?very good?. The di-
mensions of parent node are calculated by linear
combination of the child vectors? dimensions. The
vector representation v is obtained via:
v = f (g (v
l
,v
r
)) = f
(
W
[
v
l
v
r
]
+ b
)
(1)
where v
l
,v
r
are the vectors of its left and right
child, g is the composition function, f is the non-
linearity function (such as tanh, sigmoid, softsign,
etc.), W ? R
D?2D
is the composition matrix, and
b is the bias vector. The dimension of v is the
same as its child vectors, and it is recursively used
in the next step. Notably, the word vectors in the
leaf nodes are regarded as the parameters, and will
be updated according to the supervisions.
The vector representation of root node is then
fed into a softmax classifier to predict the label.
The k-th element of softmax(x) is
exp{x
k
}?
j
exp{x
j
}
. For
a vector, the softmax obtains the distribution over
K classes. Specifically, the predicted distribution
is y = softmax (Uv), where y is the predicted
distribution, U ? R
K?D
is the classification ma-
trix, and v is the vector representation of node.
3 Our Approach
We use the dependency parsing results to find the
words syntactically connected with the interested
target. Adaptive Recursive Neural Network is pro-
posed to propagate the sentiments of words to the
target node. We model the adaptive sentiment
propagations as semantic compositions. The com-
putation process is conducted in a bottom-up man-
ner, and the vector representations are computed
recursively. After we obtain the representation of
target node, a classifier is used to predict the sen-
timent label according to the vector.
In Section 3.1, we show how to build recur-
sive structure for target using the dependency pars-
ing results. In Section 3.2, we propose Adaptive
Recursive Neural Network and use it for target-
dependent sentiment analysis.
3.1 Build Recursive Structure
The dependency tree indicates the dependency re-
lations between words. As described above, we
propagate the sentiments of words to the target.
Hence the target is placed at the root node to com-
bine with its connected words recursively. The de-
pendency relation types are remained to guide the
sentiment propagations in our model.
Algorithm 1 Convert Dependency Tree
Input: Target node, Dependency tree
Output: Converted tree
1: function CONV(r)
2: E
r
? SORT(dep edges connected with r)
3: v? r
4: for (r
t
?? u/u
t
?? r) in E
r
do
5: if r is head of u then
6: w? node with CONV(u), v as children
7: else
8: w? node with v, CONV(u) as children
9: v? w
10: return v
11: Call CONV(target node) to get converted tree
As illustrated in the Algorithm 1, we recursively
convert the dependency tree starting from the tar-
get node. We find all the words connected to the
target, and these words are combined with target
node by certain order. Every combination is con-
sidered as once propagation of sentiments. If the
target is head of the connected words, the target
vector is combined as the right node; if otherwise,
it is combined as the left node. This ensures the
50
child nodes in a certain order. We use two rules
to determine the order of combinations: (1) the
words whose head is the target in dependency tree
are first combined, and then the rest of connected
words are combined; (2) if the first rule cannot de-
termine the order, the connected words are sorted
by their positions in sentence from right to left.
Notably, the conversion is performed recursively
for the connected words and the dependency rela-
tion types are remained. Figure 2 shows the con-
verted results for different targets in one sentence.
3.2 AdaRNN: Adaptive Recursive Neural
Network
RNN employs one global matrix to linearly com-
bine the elements of vectors. Sometimes it is
challenging to obtain a single powerful function
to model the semantic composition, which moti-
vates us to propose AdaRNN. The basic idea of
AdaRNN is to use more than one composition
functions and adaptively select them depending on
the linguistic tags and the combined vectors. The
model learns to propagate the sentiments of words
by using the different composition functions.
Figure 2 shows the computation process for the
example sentence ?windows is better than ios?,
where the user expresses positive sentiment to-
wards windows and negative sentiment to ios. For
the targets, the order of compositions and the de-
pendency types are different. AdaRNN adap-
tively selects the composition functions g
1
. . . g
C
depending on the child vectors and the linguistic
types. Thus it is able to determine how to propa-
gate the sentiments of words towards the target.
Based on RNN described in Section 2, we de-
fine the composition result v in AdaRNN as:
v = f
(
C
?
h=1
P (g
h
|v
l
,v
r
, e) g
h
(v
l
,v
r
)
)
(2)
where g
1
, . . . , g
C
are the composition functions,
P (g
h
|v
l
,v
r
, e) is the probability of employing g
h
given the child vectors v
l
,v
r
and external feature
vector e, and f is the nonlinearity function. For
the composition functions, we use the same forms
as in Equation (1), i.e., we have C composition
matrices W
1
. . .W
C
. We define the distribution
over these composition functions as:
?
?

P (g

, e)
.

?
?
?S
?

v

(3)
where ? is the hyper-parameter, S ? R
C?(2D+|e|)
is the matrix used to determine which composition
function we use, v
l
,v
r
are the left and right child
vectors, and e are external feature vector. In this
work, e is a one-hot binary feature vector which
indicates what the dependency type is. If relation
is the k-th type, we set e
k
to 1 and the others to 0.
Adding ? in softmax function is a widely used
parametrization method in statistical mechanics,
which is known as Boltzmann distribution and
Gibbs measure (Georgii, 2011). When ? = 0, this
function produces a uniform distribution; when
? = 1, it is the same as softmax function; when
? ??, it only activates the dimension with max-
imum weight, and sets its probability to 1.
3.3 Model Training
We use the representation of root node as the fea-
tures, and feed them into the softmax classifier to
predict the distribution over classes. We define the
ground truth vector t as a binary vector. If the k-th
class is the label, only t
k
is 1 and the others are
0. Our goal is to minimize the cross-entropy error
between the predicted distribution y and ground
truth distribution t. For each training instance, we
define the objective function as:
min
?
?
?
j
t
j
logy
j
+
?
???
?
?
???

(4)
where ? represents the parameters, and the L
2
-
regularization penalty is used.
Based on the converted tree, we employ back-
propagation algorithm (Rumelhart et al, 1986) to
propagate the errors from root node to the leaf
nodes. We calculate the derivatives to update the
parameters. The AdaGrad (Duchi et al, 2011) is
employed to solve this optimization problem.
4 Experiments
As people tend to post comments for the celebri-
ties, products, and companies, we use these key-
words (such as ?bill gates?, ?taylor swift?, ?xbox?,
?windows 7?, ?google?) to query the Twitter API.
After obtaining the tweets, we manually anno-
tate the sentiment labels (negative, neutral, posi-
tive) for these targets. In order to eliminate the
effects of data imbalance problem, we randomly
sample the tweets and make the data balanced.
The negative, neutral, positive classes account for
25%, 50%, 25%, respectively. Training data con-
sists of 6,248 tweets, and testing data has 692

Dependency tree :

Figure 2: For the sentence ?windows is better than ios?, we convert its dependency tree for the different
targets (windows and ios). AdaRNN performs semantic compositions in bottom-up manner and forward
propagates sentiment information to the target node. The g

tweets. We randomly sample some tweets, and
they are assigned with sentiment labels by two an-
notators. About 82.5% of them have the same la-
bels. The agreement percentage of polarity clas-
sification is higher than subjectivity classification.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest
target-dependent Twitter sentiment classification
dataset which is annotated manually. We make the
dataset publicly available
1
for research purposes.
We preprocess the tweets by replacing the tar-
gets with $T$ and setting their POS tags to NN.
Liblinear (Fan et al, 2008) is used for baselines.
A tweet-specific tokenizer (Gimpel et al, 2011)
is employed, and the dependency parsing results
are computed by Stanford Parser (Klein and Man-
ning, 2003). The hyper-parameters are chosen by
cross-validation on the training split, and the test
accuracy and macro-average F1-score score are re-
ported. For recursive neural models, the dimen-
sion of word vector is set to 25, and f = tanh
is used as the nonlinearity function. We employ
10 composition matrices in AdaRNN. The param-
eters are randomly initialized. Notably, the word
vectors will also be updated.
SVM-indep: It uses the uni-gram, bi-gram,
punctuations, emoticons, and #hashtags as the
content features, and the numbers of positive or
negative words in General Inquirer as lexicon fea-
tures. These features are all target-independent.
SVM-dep: We re-implement the method pro-
posed by Jiang et al (2011). It combines both
1
http://goo.gl/5Enpu7
the target-independent (SVM-indep) and target-
dependent features and uses SVM as the classifier.
There are seven rules to extract target-sensitive
features. We do not implement the social graph
optimization and target expansion tricks in it.
SVM-conn: The words, punctuations, emoti-
cons, and #hashtags included in the converted de-
pendency tree are used as the features for SVM.
RNN: It is performed on the converted depen-
dency tree without adaptive composition selection.
AdaRNN-w/oE: Our approach without using
the dependency types as features in adaptive se-
lection for the composition functions.
AdaRNN-w/E: Our approach with employing
the dependency types as features in adaptive se-
lection for the composition functions.
AdaRNN-comb: We combine the root vectors
obtained by AdaRNN-w/E with the uni/bi-gram
features, and they are fed into a SVM classifier.

Twitter sentiment classification dataset. Our ap-
proach outperforms the baseline methods.

As shown in the Table 1, AdaRNN achieves bet-
ter results than the baselines. Specifically, we find
that the performances of SVM-dep increase than
SVM-indep. It indicates that target-dependent fea-
tures help improve the results. However, the accu-
racy and F1-score do not gain significantly. This
is caused by mismatch of the rules (Jiang et al,
2011) used to extract the target-dependent fea-
tures. The POS tagging and dependency parsing
results are not precise enough for the Twitter data,
so these hand-crafted rules are rarely matched.
Further, the results of SVM-conn illustrate that us-
ing the words which have paths to target as bag-of-
words features does not perform well.
RNN is also based on the converted depen-
dency tree. It outperforms SVM-indep, and is
comparable with SVM-dep. The performances
of AdaRNN-w/oE are better than the above base-
lines. It shows that multiple composition functions
and adaptive selection help improve the results.
AdaRNN provides more powerful composition
ability, so that it achieves better semantic compo-
sition for recursive neural models. AdaRNN-w/E
obtains best performances among the above meth-
ods. Its macro-average F1-score rises by 5.3%
than the target-independent method SVM-indep.
It employs dependency types as binary features to
select the composition functions adaptively. The
results illustrate that the syntactic tags are helpful
to guide the model propagate sentiments of words
towards target. Although the dependency results
are also not precise enough, the composition se-
lection is automatically learned from data. Hence
AdaRNN is more robust for the imprecision of
parsing results than the hand-crafted rules. The
performances become better after adding the uni-
gram and bi-gram features (target-independent).
4.1 Effects of ?
We compare different ? for AdaRNN defined in
Equation (3) in this section. Different parameter ?
leads to different composition selection schemes.
As illustrated in Figure 3, the AdaRNN-w/oE
and AdaRNN-w/E achieve the best accuracies at
? = 2, and they have a similar trend. Specifi-
cally, ? = 0 obtains a uniform distribution over
the composition functions which does not help im-
prove performances. ? ? ? results in a max-
imum probability selection algorithm, i.e., only
the composition function which has the maximum
probability is used. This selection scheme makes

form selection and maximum selection. It adjusts
the effects of these two perspectives.
5 Conclusion
We propose Adaptive Recursive Neural Network
(AdaRNN) for the target-dependent Twitter senti-
ment classification. AdaRNN employs more than
one composition functions and adaptively chooses
them depending on the context and linguistic tags.
For a given tweet, we first convert its dependency
tree for the interested target. Next, the AdaRNN
learns how to adaptively propagate the sentiments
of words to the target node. AdaRNN enables
the sentiment propagations to be sensitive to both
linguistic and semantic categories by using differ-
ent compositions. The experimental results illus-
trate that AdaRNN improves the baselines without
hand-crafted rules.
