Abstract
Segmentation of clitics has been shown to
improve accuracy on a variety of Arabic
NLP tasks. However, state-of-the-art Ara-
bic word segmenters are either limited to
formal Modern Standard Arabic, perform-
ing poorly on Arabic text featuring dialectal
vocabulary and grammar, or rely on lin-
guistic knowledge that is hand-tuned for
each dialect. We extend an existing MSA
segmenter with a simple domain adapta-
tion technique and new features in order
to segment informal and dialectal Arabic
text. Experiments show that our system
outperforms existing systems on newswire,
broadcast news and Egyptian dialect, im-
proving segmentation F
1
score on a recently
released Egyptian Arabic corpus to 95.1%,
compared to 90.8% for another segmenter
designed specifically for Egyptian Arabic.
1 Introduction
Segmentation of words, clitics, and affixes is essen-
tial for a number of natural language processing
(NLP) applications, including machine translation,
parsing, and speech recognition (Chang et al, 2008;
Tsarfaty, 2006; Kurimo et al, 2006). Segmentation
is a common practice in Arabic NLP due to the lan-
guage?s morphological richness. Specifically, clitic
separation has been shown to improve performance
on Arabic parsing (Green and Manning, 2010) and
Arabic-English machine translation (Habash and
Sadat, 2006). However, the variety of Arabic di-
alects presents challenges in Arabic NLP. Dialectal
Arabic contains non-standard orthography, vocab-
ulary, morphology, and syntax. Tools that depend
on corpora or grammatical properties that only con-
sider formal Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) do
not perform well when confronted with these differ-
ences. The creation of annotated corpora in dialec-
tal Arabic (Maamouri et al, 2006) has promoted
the development of new systems that support di-
alectal Arabic, but these systems tend to be tailored
to specific dialects and require separate efforts for
Egyptian Arabic, Levantine Arabic, Maghrebi Ara-
bic, etc.
We present a single clitic segmentation model
that is accurate on both MSA and informal Arabic.
The model is an extension of the character-level
conditional random field (CRF) model of Green
and DeNero (2012). Our work goes beyond theirs
in three aspects. First, we handle two Arabic ortho-
graphic normalization rules that commonly require
rewriting of tokens after segmentation. Second,
we add new features that improve segmentation ac-
curacy. Third, we show that dialectal data can be
handled in the framework of domain adaptation.
Specifically, we show that even simple feature space
augmentation (Daum?, 2007) yields significant im-
provements in task accuracy.
We compare our work to the original Green and
DeNero model and two other Arabic segmenta-
tion systems: the MADA+TOKAN toolkit v. 3.1
(Habash et al, 2009) and its Egyptian dialect vari-
ant, MADA-ARZ v. 0.4 (Habash et al, 2013). We
demonstrate that our system achieves better perfor-
mance across the board, beating all three systems
on MSA newswire, informal broadcast news, and
Egyptian dialect. Our segmenter achieves a 95.1%
F
1
segmentation score evaluated against a gold stan-
dard on Egyptian dialect data, compared to 90.8%
for MADA-ARZ and 92.9% for Green and DeN-
ero. In addition, our model decodes input an order
of magnitude faster than either version of MADA.
Like the Green and DeNero system, but unlike
MADA and MADA-ARZ, our system does not rely
on a morphological analyzer, and can be applied
directly to any dialect for which segmented training
data is available. The source code is available in
the latest public release of the Stanford Word Seg-
menter (http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/
segmenter.shtml).

2 Arabic Word Segmentation Model
A CRF model (Lafferty et al, 2001) defines a distri-
bution p(Y|X; ?), whereX = {x
1
, . . . , x
N
} is the
observed input sequence andY = {y
1
, . . . , y
N
} is
the sequence of labels we seek to predict. Green
and DeNero use a linear-chain model with X as
the sequence of input characters, and Y
?
chosen
according to the decision rule
Y
?
= argmax
Y
N
?
i=1
?
>
?(X, y
i
, . . . , y
i?3
, i) .
where ? is the feature map defined in Section 2.1.
Their model classifies each y
i
as one of I (contin-
uation of a segment), O (whitespace outside any
segment), B (beginning of a segment), or F (pre-
grouped foreign characters).
Our segmenter expands this label space in order
to handle two Arabic-specific orthographic rules.
In our model, each y
i
can take on one of the six
values {I,O,B,F,RewAl,RewTa}:
? RewAl indicates that the current character,
which is always the Arabic letter ? l, starts a
new segment and should additionally be trans-
formed into the definite article ? @ al- when
segmented. This type of transformation occurs
after the prefix ? li- ?to?.
? RewTa indicates that the current character,
which is always the Arabic letter

H t, is a
continuation but should be transformed into
the letter

? h when segmented. Arabic orthog-
raphy rules restrict the occurrence of

? h to
the word-final position, writing it instead as

H t whenever it is followed by a suffix.
2.1 Features
The model of Green and DeNero is a third-order
(i.e., 4-gram) Markov CRF, employing the follow-
ing indicator features:
? a five-character window around the current
character: for each ?2 ? ? ? 2 and 1 ? i ?
N , the triple (x
i+?
, ?, y
i
)
? n-grams consisting of the current character
and up to three preceding characters: for
each 2 ? n ? 4 and n ? i ? N ,
the character-sequence/label-sequence pair
(x
i?n+1
. . . x
i
, y
i?n+1
. . . y
i
)
? whether the current character is punctuation
? whether the current character is a digit
? the Unicode block of the current character
? the Unicode character class of the current char-
acter
In addition to these, we include two other types of
features motivated by specific errors the original
system made on Egyptian dialect development data:
? Word length and position within a word: for
each 1 ? i ? N , the pairs (`, y
i
), (a, y
i
), and
(b, y
i
), where `, a, and b are the total length
of the word containing x
i
, the number of char-
acters after x
i
in the word, and the number of
characters before x
i
in the word, respectively.
Some incorrect segmentations produced by
the original system could be ruled out with the
knowledge of these statistics.
? First and last two characters of the current
word, separately influencing the first two
labels and the last two labels: for each
word consisting of characters x
s
. . . x
t
, the tu-
ples (x
s
x
s+1
, x
t?1
x
t
, y
s
y
s+1
, ?begin?) and
(x
s
x
s+1
, x
t?1
x
t
, y
t?1
y
t
, ?end?). This set of
features addresses a particular dialectal Arabic
construction, the negation A? m
?
a- + [verb] +

? -sh, which requires a matching prefix and
suffix to be segmented simultaneously. This
feature set alo allows themodel to take into ac-
count other interactions between the beginning
and end of a word, particularly those involving
the definite article ? @ al-.
A notable property of this feature set is that it re-
mains highly dialect-agnostic, even though our ad-
ditional features were chosen in response to errors
made on text in Egyptian dialect. In particular,
it does not depend on the existence of a dialect-
specific lexicon or morphological analyzer. As a
result, we expect this model to perform similarly
well when applied to other Arabic dialects.
2.2 Domain adaptation
In this work, we train our model to segment Arabic
text drawn from three domains: newswire, which
consists of formal text in MSA; broadcast news,
which contains scripted, formal MSA as well as
extemporaneous dialogue in a mix of MSA and di-
alect; and discussion forum posts written primarily
in Egyptian dialect.

orthographic rewrites with the RewAl and RewTa labels. The fifth row shows the strongest baseline,
which is the GD+Rew model trained on the concatenated training sets from all three treebanks. DA is
domain adaptation via feature space augmentation. Feat adds the additional feature templates described
in section 2.1. ATB is the newswire ATB; BN is the Broadcast News treebank; ARZ is the Egyptian
treebank. Best results (bold) are statistically significant (p < 0.001) relative to the strongest baseline.
The approach to domain adaptation we use is
that of feature space augmentation (Daum?, 2007).
Each indicator feature from the model described
in Section 2.1 is replaced by N + 1 features in
the augmented model, where N is the number of
domains from which the data is drawn (here, N =
3). These N + 1 features consist of the original
feature and N ?domain-specific? features, one for
each of theN domains, each of which is active only
when both the original feature is present and the
current text comes from its assigned domain.
3 Experiments
We train and evaluate on three corpora: parts 1?3 of
the newswire Arabic Treebank (ATB),
1
the Broad-
cast News Arabic Treebank (BN),
2
and parts 1?8
of the BOLT Phase 1 Egyptian Arabic Treebank
(ARZ).
3
These correspond respectively to the do-
mains in section 2.2. We target the segmentation
scheme used by these corpora (leaving morphologi-
cal affixes and the definite article attached). For the
ATB, we use the same split as Chiang et al (2006).
For each of the other two corpora, we split the data
into 80% training, 10% development, and 10% test
in chronological order by document.

We train the
Green and DeNero model and our improvements

3.1 Evaluation metrics
We use two evaluation metrics in our experiments.
The first is an F
1
precision-recall measure, ignoring
orthographic rewrites. F
1
scores provide a more
informative assessment of performance than word-
level or character-level accuracy scores, as over 80%
of tokens in the development sets consist of only
one segment, with an average of one segmentation
every 4.7 tokens (or one every 20.4 characters).
The second metric we use is the TEDEval met-
ric (Tsarfaty et al, 2012). TEDEval was devel-
oped to evaluate joint segmentation and parsing
5
in Hebrew, which requires a greater variety of or-
thographic rewrites than those possible in Arabic.
Its edit distance-based scoring algorithm is robust
enough to handle the rewrites produced by both
MADA and our segmenter.
We measure the statistical significance of differ-
ences in these metrics with an approximate ran-
domization test (Yeh, 2000; Pad?, 2006), with
R = 10,000 samples.
3.2 Results
Table 1 contains results on the development set
for the model of Green and DeNero and our im-
provements. Using domain adaptation alone helps
performance on two of the three datasets (with a sta-
tistically insignificant decrease on broadcast news),
and that our additional features further improve
5
In order to evaluate segmentation in isolation, we convert
each segmented sentence from both the model output and
the gold standard to a flat tree with all segments descending
directly from the root.

4 Error Analysis
We sampled 100 errors randomly from all errors
made by our final model (trained on all three
datasets with domain adaptation and additional fea-
tures) on the ARZ development set; see Table 4.
These errors fall into three general categories:
? typographical errors and annotation inconsis-
tencies in the gold data;
? errors that can be fixed with a fuller analysis
of just the problematic token, and therefore
represent a deficiency in the feature set; and
? errors that would require additional context or
sophisticated semantic awareness to fix.
4.1 Typographical errors and annotation
inconsistencies
Of the 100 errors we sampled, 33 are due to typo-
graphical errors or inconsistencies in the gold data.
We classify 7 as typos and 26 as annotation incon-
sistencies, although the distinction between the two
is murky: typos are intentionally preserved in the
treebank data, but segmentation of typos varies de-
pending on how well they can be reconciled with
standard Arabic orthography. Four of the seven
typos are the result of a missing space, such as:

The first example is segmented in the Egyptian tree-
bank but is left unsegmented by our system; the
second is left as a single token in the treebank but is
split into the above three segments by our system.
Of the annotation inconsistencies that do not in-
volve typographical errors, a handful are segmen-
tation mistakes; however, in the majority of these
cases, the annotator chose not to segment a word
for justifiable but arbitrary reasons. In particular, a
few colloquial ?filler? expressions are sometimes
not segmented, despite being compound Arabic
words that are segmented elsewhere in the data.
These include A

rying Arabic affixes. An example of this is

4.2 Features too local
In 36 of the 100 sampled errors, we conjecture that
the presence of the error indicates a shortcoming
of the feature set, resulting in segmentations that
make sense locally but are not plausible given the
full token. Two examples of these are:

4.3 Context-sensitive segmentations and
multiple word senses
In the remaining 31 of 100 errors, external context
is needed. In many of these, it is not clear how to
address the error without sophisticated semantic
reasoning about the surrounding sentence.
One token accounts for five of these errors: B?
wl
?
a, which in Egyptian dialect can be analyzed as
? wa- + B l
?
a ?and [do/does] not? or as B

? wall
?
a
?or?. In a few cases, either is syntactically correct,
and the meaning must be inferred from context.
Two other ambiguities are a frequent cause of
error and seem to require sophisticated disambigua-
tion. The first is A
	
J -n
?
a, which is both a first person
plural object pronoun and a first person plural past
tense ending. The former is segmented, while the
latter is not. An example of this is the pair A

other is ?


 -y, which is both a first person singular
possessive pronoun and the nisba adjective ending
(which turns a noun into an adjective meaning ?of

example of this distinction that appeared in the de-
velopment set is the pair ?

5 Conclusion
In this paper we demonstrate substantial gains on
Arabic clitic segmentation for both formal and
dialectal text using a single model with dialect-
independent features and a simple domain adap-
tation strategy. We present a new Arabic segmenter
which performs better than tools employing sophis-
ticated linguistic analysis, while also giving im-
pressive speed improvements. We evaluated our
segmenter on broadcast news and Egyptian Arabic
due to the current availability of annotated data in
these domains. However, as data for other Arabic di-
alects and genres becomes available, we expect that
the model?s simplicity and the domain adaptation
method we use will allow the system to be applied
to these dialects with minimal effort and without a
loss of performance in the original domains.
