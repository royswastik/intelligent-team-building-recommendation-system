Abstract
Internet users are keen on creating differ-
ent kinds of morphs to avoid censorship,
express strong sentiment or humor. For
example, in Chinese social media, users
often use the entity morph ???? (In-
stant Noodles)? to refer to ???? (Zhou
Yongkang)? because it shares one char-
acter ?? (Kang)? with the well-known
brand of instant noodles ???? (Master
Kang)?. We developed a wide variety of
novel approaches to automatically encode
proper and interesting morphs, which can
effectively pass decoding tests
1
.
1 Introduction
One of the most innovative linguistic forms in so-
cial media is Information Morph (Huang et al,
2013). Morph is a special case of alias to hide the
original objects (e.g., sensitive entities and events)
for different purposes, including avoiding censor-
ship (Bamman et al, 2012; Chen et al, 2013),
expressing strong sentiment, emotion or sarcasm,
and making descriptions more vivid. Morphs are
widely used in Chinese social media. Here is an
example morphs: ?????????????
????. (Because of Gua Dad?s issue, Instant
Noodles faces down with Antenna.)?, where
? ??? (Gua Dad)? refers to ???? (Bo Xilai)?
because it shares one character ?? (Gua)? with
???? (Bo Guagua)? who is the son of ???
? (Bo Xilai)?;
? ???? (Instant Noodles)? refers to ????
(Zhou Yongkang)? because it shares one char-
acter ?? (kang)? with the well-known instant
noodles brand ???? (Master Kang)?;
1
The morphing data set is available for research purposes:
http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/data/morphencoding.tar.gz
? ??? (Antenna)? refers to ???? (Wen Ji-
abao)? because it shares one character ??
(baby)? with the famous children?s television
series ????? (Teletubbies)?;
In contrast with covert or subliminal chan-
nels studied extensively in cryptography and se-
curity, Morphing provides confidentiality against
a weaker adversary which has to make a real time
or near real time decision whether or not to block
a morph within a time interval t. It will take longer
than the duration t for a morph decoder to decide
which encoding method is used and exactly how it
is used; otherwise adversary can create a codebook
and decode the morphs with a simple look up.
We note that there are other distinct characteristics
of morphs that make them different from crypto-
graphic constructs: (1) Morphing can be consid-
ered as a way of using natural language to com-
municate confidential information without encryp-
tion. Most morphs are encoded based on seman-
tic meaning and background knowledge instead
of lexical changes, so they are closer to Jargon.
(2) There can be multiple morphs for an entity.
(3) The Shannon?s Maxim ?the enemy knows the
system? does not always hold. There is no com-
mon code-book or secret key between the sender
and the receiver of a morph. (4) Social networks
play an important role in creating morphs. One
main purpose of encoding morphs is to dissemi-
nate them widely so they can become part of the
new Internet language. Therefore morphs should
be interesting, fun, intuitive and easy to remem-
ber. (5) Morphs rapidly evolve over time, as some
morphs are discovered and blocked by censorship
and newly created morphs emerge.
We propose a brand new and challenging re-
search problem - can we automatically encode
morphs for any given entity to help users commu-
nicate in an appropriate and fun way?
706
2 Approaches
2.1 Motivation from Human Approaches
Let?s start from taking a close look at human?s
intentions and general methods to create morphs
from a social cognitive perspective. In Table 1
and Table 2, we summarize 548 randomly selected
morphs into different categories. In this paper we
automate the first seven human approaches, with-
out investigating the most challenging Method 8,
which requires deep mining of rich background
and tracking all events involving the entities.
2.2 M1: Phonetic Substitution
Given an entity name e, we obtain its pho-
netic transcription pinyin(e). Similarly, for each
unique term t extracted from Tsinghua Weibo
dataset (Zhang et al, 2013) with one billion
tweets from 1.8 million users from 8/28/2012 to
9/29/2012, we obtain pinyin(t). According to the
Chinese phonetic transcription articulation man-
ner
2
, the pairs (b, p), (d, t), (g,k), (z,c), (zh,ch),
( j,q), (sh,r), (x,h), (l,n), (c,ch), (s,sh) and (z,zh)
are mutually transformable.
If a part of pinyin(e) and pinyin(t) are identi-
cal or their initials are transformable, we substi-
tute the part of e with t to form a new morph.
For example, we can substitute the characters of
??? ?? (Bill Gates) [Bi Er Gai Ci]? with
??? (Nose and ear) [Bi Er]? and ??? (Lid)
[Gai Zi]? to form new morph ??? ?? (Nose
and ear Lid) [Bi Er Gai Zi]?. We rank the candi-
dates based on the following two criteria: (1) If the
morph includes more negative words (based on a
gazetteer including 11,729 negative words derived
from HowNet (Dong and Dong, 1999), it?s more
humorous (Valitutti et al, 2013). (2) If the morph
includes rarer terms with low frequency, it is more
interesting (Petrovic and Matthews, 2013).
2.3 M2: Spelling Decomposition
Chinese characters are ideograms, hieroglyphs
and mostly picture-based. It allows us to natu-
rally construct a virtually infinite range of combi-
nations from a finite set of basic units - radicals (Li
and Zhou, 2007). Some of these radicals them-
selves are also characters. For a given entity name
e = c
1
...c
n
, if any character c
k
can be decomposed
into two radicals c
1
k
and c
2
k
which are both char-
acters or can be converted into characters based
on their pictograms (e.g., the radical ??? can be
2
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin#Initials and finals
converted into??? (grass) ), we create a morph by
replacing c
k
with c
1
k
c
2
k
in e. Here we use a charac-
ter to radical mapping table that includes 191 rad-
icals (59 of them are characters) and 1328 com-
mon characters. For example, we create a morph
???? (Person Dumb Luo)? for ??? (Paul)?
by decomposing ?? (Pau-)? into ?? (Person)?
and ?? (Dull)?. A natural alternative is to com-
posing two chracter radicals in an entity name to
form a morph. However, very few Chinese names
include two characters with single radicals.
2.4 M3: Nickname Generation
We propose a simple method to create morphs by
duplicating the last character of an entity?s first
name. For example, we create a morph ???
(Mimi)? to refer to ??? (Yang Mi)?.
2.5 M4: Translation and Transliteration
Given an entity e, we search its English translation
EN(e) based on 94,015 name translation pairs (Ji
et al, 2009). Then, if any name component in
EN(e) is a common English word, we search for
its Chinese translation based on a 94,966 word
translation pairs (Zens and Ney, 2004), and use the
Chinese translation to replace the corresponding
characters in e. For example, we create a morph
??? ?? (Larry bird)? for ??? ?? (Larry
Bird)? by replacing the last name ??? (Bird)?
with its Chinese translation ??? (bird)?.
2.6 M5: Semantic Interpretation
For each character c
k
in the first name of a given
entity name e, we search its semantic interpreta-
tion sentence from the Xinhua Chinese character
dictionary including 20,894 entries
3
. If a word
in the sentence contains c
k
, we append the word
with the last name of e to form a new morph. Sim-
ilarly to M1, we prefer positive, negative or rare
words. For example, we create a morph ????
(Bo Mess)? for ???? (Bo Xi Lai)? because the
semantic interpretation sentence for ?? (Lai)? in-
cludes a negative word ??? (Mess)?.
2.7 M6: Historical Figure Mapping
We collect a set of 38 famous historical figures
including politicians, emperors, poets, generals,
ministers and scholars from a website. For a given
entity name e, we rank these candidates by ap-
plying the resolution approach as described in our
previous work (Huang et al, 2013) to measure the
similarity between an entity and a historic figure

this approach generates a morph ??? (the First
Emperor)? for ???? (Mao Zedong)? who is the
first chairman of P. R. China and ??? (the Sec-
ond Emperor )? for ???? (Deng Xiaoping )?
who succeeded Mao.
2.8 M7: Characteristics Modeling
Finally, we propose a novel approach to auto-
matically generate an entity?s characteristics using
Google word2vec model (Mikolov et al, 2013).
To make the vocabulary model as general as pos-
sible, we use all of the following large corpora
that we have access to: Tsinghua Weibo dataset,
Chinese Gigaword fifth edition
4
which includes
10 million news documents, TAC-KBP 2009-2013
Source Corpora (McNamee and Dang, 2009; Ji et
4
http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2011T13
al., 2010; Ji et al, 2011; Ji and Grishman, 2011)
which include 3 million news and web documents,
and DARPA BOLT program?s discussion forum
corpora with 300k threads. Given an entity e, we
compute the semantic relationship between e and
each word from these corpora. We then rank the
words by: (1) cosine similarity, (2) the same cri-
teria as in section 2.6. Finally we append the top
ranking word to the entity?s last name to obtain
a new morph. Using this method, we are able
to generate many vivid morphs such as ?? ??
(Yao Wizard)? for ??? (Yao Ming)?.
3 Experiments
3.1 Data
We collected 1,553,347 tweets from Chinese Sina
Weibo from May 1 to June 30, 2013. We extracted
708
187 human created morphs based on M1-M7 for
55 person entities. Our approach generated 382
new morphs in total.
3.2 Human Evaluation
We randomly asked 9 Chinese native speakers
who regularly access Chinese social media and are
not involved in this work to conduct evaluation in-
dependently. We designed the following three cri-
teria based on Table 1:
? Perceivability: Who does this morph refer to?
(i) Pretty sure, (ii) Not sure, and (iii) No clues.
? Funniness: How interesting is the morph? (i)
Funny, (ii) Somewhat funny, and (iii) Not funny.
? Appropriateness: Does the morph describe the
target entity appropriately? (i) Make sense, (ii)
Make a little sense, and (iii) Make no sense.
The three choices of each criteria account for
100% (i), 50% (ii) and 0% (iii) satisfaction rate,
respectively. If the assessor correctly predicts the
target entity with the Perceivability measure, (s)he
is asked to continue to answer the Funniness and
Appropriateness questions; otherwise the Funni-
ness and Appropriateness scores are 0. The hu-
man evaluation results are shown in Table 4. The
Fleiss?s kappa coefficient among all the human as-
sessors is 0.147 indicating slight agreement.
From Table 4 we can see that overall the sys-
tem achieves 66% of the human performance
with comparable stability as human. In partic-
ular, Method 4 based on translation and translit-
eration generates much more perceivable morphs
than human because the system may search in a
larger vocabulary. Interestingly, similar encour-
aging results - system outperforms human - have
been observed by previous back-transliteration
work (Knight and Graehl, 1998).
It?s also interesting to see that human assessors
can only comprehend 76% of the human generated
morphs because of the following reasons: (1) the
morph is newly generated or it does not describe
the characteristics of the target entity well; and (2)
the target entity itself is not well known to human
assessors who do not keep close track of news top-
ics. In fact only 64 human generated morphs and
72 system generated morphs are perceivable by all
human assessors.
For Method 2, the human created morphs are
assessed as much more and funny than the sys-
tem generated ones because human creators use
this approach only if: (1). the radicals still reflect
the meaning of the character (e.g., ?? (worry)?
is decomposed into two radicals ??? (heart au-
tumn)? instead of three ????? (grain fire heart)
because people tend to feel sad when the leaves
fall in the autumn), (2). the morph reflects some
characteristics of the entity (e.g., ???? (Jiang
Zemin)? has a morph ????? (Water Engi-
neer Zemin)? because he gave many instructions
on water conservancy construction); or (3). The
morph becomes very vivid and funny (e.g., the
morph ?????? (Muji Yue Yue Bird)? for
???? is assessed as very funny because ??
?(Muji)? looks like a Japanese name, ???(Yue
Yue)? can also refer to a famous chubby woman,
and ??? (bird man)? is a bad word referring to
bad people); or (4). The morph expresses strong
sentiment or sarcasm; or (5) The morph is the
name of another entity (e.g., the morph ???(Gu
Yue)? for ????(Hu Jintao)? is also the name
of a famous actor who often acts as Mao Zedong).
The automatic approach didn?t explore these intel-
ligent constraints and thus produced more boring
morph. Moreover, sometimes human creators fur-
ther exploit traditional Chinese characters, gener-
alize or modify the decomposition results.
Table 3 presents some good (with average score
above 80%) and bad (with average score below
20%) examples.

Table 3: System Generated Morph Examples
To understand whether users would adopt sys-
tem generated morphs for their social media com-
munication, we also ask the assessors to recite
the morphs that they remember after the survey.
Among all the morphs that they remember cor-
rectly, 20.4% are system generated morphs, which
is encouraging.
3.3 Automatic Evaluation
Another important goal of morph encoding is to
avoid censorship and freely communicate about

Table 4: Human Evaluation Satisfaction Rate (%)
certain entities. To evaluate how well the new
morphs can pass censorship, we simulate the cen-
sorship using an automatic morph decoder con-
sisted of a morph candidate identification system
based on Support Vector Machines incorporating
anomaly analysis and our morph resolution sys-
tem (Huang et al, 2013). We use each system gen-
erated morph to replace its corresponding human-
created morphs in Weibo tweets and obtain a new
?morphed? data set. The morph decoder is then
applied to it. We define discovery rate as the per-
centage of morphs identified by the decoder, and
the ranking accuracy Acc@k to evaluate the reso-
lution performance. We conduct this decoding ex-
periment on 247 system generated and 151 human
generated perceivable morphs with perceivability
scores > 70% from human evaluation.
Figure 1 shows that in general the decoder
achieves lower discovery rate on system gener-
ated morphs than human generated ones, because
the identification component in the decoder was
trained based on human morph related features.
This result is promising because it demonstrates
that the system generated morphs contain new and
unique characteristics which are unknown to the
decoder. In contrast, from Figure 2 we can see
that system generated morphs can be more easily
resolved into the right target entities than human
generated ones which are more implicit.

4 Related Work
Some recent work attempted to map between Chi-
nese formal words and informal words (Xia et al,
2005; Xia and Wong, 2006; Xia et al, 2006; Li
Figure 2: Resolution Acc@K Accuracy (%)
and Yarowsky, 2008; Wang et al, 2013; Wang and
Kan, 2013). We incorporated the pronunciation,
lexical and semantic similarity measurements pro-
posed in these approaches. Some of our basic se-
lection criteria are also similar to the constraints
used in previous work on generating humors (Val-
itutti et al, 2013; Petrovic and Matthews, 2013).
5 Conclusions and Future Work
This paper proposed a new problem of encoding
entity morphs and developed a wide variety of
novel automatic approaches. In the future we will
focus on improving the language-independent ap-
proaches based on historical figure mapping and
culture and reputation modeling. In addition, we
plan to extend our approaches to other types of in-
formation including sensitive events, satires and
metaphors so that we can generate fable stories.
We are also interested in tracking morphs over
time to study the evolution of Internet language.
