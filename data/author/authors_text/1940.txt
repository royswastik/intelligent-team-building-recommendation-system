Studies show that only 10% of corporate training is ever applied within the work-
place. This is because organisations tend to use school based methods of learning
which are not appropriate. Our approach, based on theories of learning in the work-
place, supports organisational learning and knowledge sharing by enriching web
documents with informal and formal representations. This enrichment captures
the context in which a document was created and has been applied, facilitating its
retrieval and comprehension.
