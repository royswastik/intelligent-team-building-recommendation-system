Abstract
Microblogging services have attracted hundreds of millions of users to publish their status, ideas
and thoughts, everyday. These microblog posts have also become one of the most attractive and
valuable resources for applications in different areas. The task of identifying the main targets of
microblogs is an important and essential step for these applications. In this paper, to achieve this
task, we propose a novel method which converts the target company identification problem to
the translation process from content to targets. We introduce a topic-specific generative method
to model the translation process. Topic specific trigger words are used to bridge the vocabulary
gap between the words in microblogs and targets. We examine the effectiveness of our approach
via datasets gathered from real world microblogs. Experimental results demonstrate a 20.2%
improvement in terms of F1-score over the state-of-the-art discriminative method.
1 Introduction
With the rapid growth of social media, about 72% of adult internet users are also members of
a social networking site
1
. Over the past few years, microblogging has become one of the most
popular services. Meanwhile, microblogs have also been widely used as sources for analyzing public
opinions (Bermingham and Smeaton, 2010; Jiang et al., 2011), prediction (Asur and Huberman, 2010;
Bollen et al., 2011), reputation management (Pang and Lee, 2008; Otsuka et al., 2012), and many other
applications (Bian et al., 2008; Sakaki et al., 2010; Becker et al., 2010; Guy et al., 2010; Lee and Croft,
2013; Guy et al., 2013). For most of these applications, identifying the microblogs that are relevant to
the targets of interest is one of the basic steps (Lin and He, 2009; Amig?o et al., 2010; Qiu et al., 2011;
Liu et al., 2013). Let us firstly consider the following example:
Example 1: 11? MacBook Air can run for up to five hours on a single charge.
?MacBook Air? can be considered to be the target being discussed on the microblog, and we can also
infer from the microblog that it is related to Apple Inc. The ability to discriminate which company is
being referred to in a microblog is required by many applications.
Previous studies on fine-grained sentiment analysis and aspect-based opinion mining proposed
supervised (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Liu et al., 2012a; Liu et al., 2013) and unsupervised methods (Hu
and Liu, 2004; Wu et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010) to extract targets of opinion expressions. Based on
the associations between opinion targets and opinion words, some methods were also introduced to
simultaneously solve the opinion expression and target extraction problems (Qiu et al., 2011; Liu et al.,
2012a). However, most of the existing methods in this area only focus on extracting items about which
opinions are expressed in a given domain. The implicated information of targets is rarely considered.
Moreover, domain adaptation is another big challenge for these fine-grained methods in processing
different domains.

(Amig?o et al., 2013) evaluation campaigns also
addressed the problem from the perspective of the disambiguation of company names in microblogs.
Microblogs that contain company names at a lexical level are classified based on whether it refers
to the company or not. Various approaches have been proposed to address the task with different
methods (Pedersen et al., 2006; Yerva et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2012; Spina et al., 2012; Spina et
al., 2013). However, the microblogs that do not contain company names cannot be correctly processed
using these methods. From analyzing the data, we observe that a variety of microblog posts belong to
this type. They only contain products names, slang terms, and other related company content.
To achieve this task, in this paper, we propose the use of a translation based model to identify the targets
of microblogs. We assume that the microblog posts and targets describe the same topic using different
languages. Hence, the target identification problem can be regarded as a translation process from the
content of the microblogs to the targets. We integrate latent topical information into the translation
model to facilitate the translation process. Because product names, series, and other related information
are important indicators for this task, we also incorporate this background knowledge into the model. To
evaluate the proposed method, we collect a large number of microblogs and manually annotate a subset
of these as golden standards. We compare the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods using the
constructed dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve better
performance than the other approaches.
2 The Proposed Method
2.1 The Generation Process
Given a corpus D = {d
i
, 1 ? i ? |D|}, which contains a list of microblogs {d
i
}. A microblog is a
sequence of N
d
words denoted by w
d
= {w
d1
, w
d2
, ..., w
dN
d
}. Each microblog contains a set of targets
denoted by c
d
= {c
d1
, c
d2
, ..., c
dM
d
}. A word is defined as an item from a vocabulary with V distinct
words indexed by w = {w
1
, w
2
, ..., w
V
}. The nth word in the dth microblog is associated with not only
one topic z
dn
, but also an indicator variable l
dn
which indicates whether w
dn
belongs to the ontology
(l
dn
= 1), which contains company names, product names, series, and other related information, or is a
common word (l
dn
= 0). Each target is from the vocabulary with C distinct company names indexed by
c = {c
1
, c
2
, ..., c
C
}. The mth target in the dth microblog is associated with a topic z
dm
. The notations
used in this paper are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 1 shows the graphical representation of the generation
process. The generative story for each microblog is as follows:
1. Sample word distribution ?
t,l
fromDir(?
l
) for each topic t = 1, 2, ..., T and each label l = 1, ..., L.
2. For each microblog d=1,2,...,|D|
a. Sample topic distribution ?
d
from Dir(?)
b. For each word n = 1, 2, ..., N
d
i. Sample a topic z
dn
= t from Multinomial(?
d
)
ii. Sample a label l
dn
= l from the distribution over labels, v
d,n
iii. Sample a wordw according to multinomial distribution P (w
dn
= w|z
dn
= t, l
dn
= l, ?
t,l
)
c. For each target m = 1, 2, ...,M
d
i. Sample a topic z
dm
= t from Multinomial(?
d
)
ii. Sample a target c
dm
= c according to probability P (c
dm
= c|w
d
, l
d
, z
dm
= t, B)
As described above, we use l
dn
to incorporate the ontology information into the model. In this work,
we construct an ontology which contains 4,926 company names, 7,632 abbreviations, and 26,732 product
names. These companies names are collected based on the top search queries in different categories
4
.
We propose to use the distribution v
d,n
to indicate the probability of variable l
dn
. We set v
d,n
by applying

(presented by f

In this work, we only consider the word itself as its context feature. This information is encoded into
the hyperparameters {?
w
|w ? {w

}}, where ?

to a value 0.9, ?

to a value 0.1. For each
word w not contained by ontology, we set ?
w
1
to a value 0 and ?
w

to a value 1. Based on the ontology,
v

could be set as follows:

2.2 Model Inference
We use collapsed Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) to obtain samples of hidden variable
assignment and to estimate the model parameters from these samples.
On the microblog content side, the conditional probability of a latent topic and label for the nth word
in the dth microblog is:
Pr(z
dn
= t, l
dn
= l|w

the microblog d; N

Given the conditional probability of z

dn

dn

as follows:

Based on the above equations, after enough sampling iterations, we can estimate word alignment table

. Some companies just occur few times, and most of the words co-occur with
them also alignment with other companies, for this case, we use ?C to smooth, where C represent the
number of company c. And also we can estimate topic distribution ? for each document, and word
distribution ? for each topic and each label, as follows:
?

The possibility table B
c,w,t,l
has a potential size of V ?C ?T ?L. The data sparsity may pose a problem
in estimating B
c,w,t,l
. To reduce the data sparsity problem, we introduce the remedy in our model. We
691
employ a linear interpolation with topic-free word alignment probability to avoid data sparsity problem:
B
?
c,w,t,l
= ?B
c,w,t,l
+ (1? ?)P (c|w),
(6)
where P (c|w) is topic-free word alignment probability between the word w and the company c. ? is
trade-off of two probabilities ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.
2.3 Target Company Extraction
Just like standard LDA, the proposed method itself finds a set of topics but does not directly extract
targets. Suppose we have a dataset which contains microblogs without targets, we can use the collapsed
Gibbs sampling to estimate the topic and label for the words in each microblog. The process is the same
as described in Section 3.2.
After the hidden topics and label of the words in each microblog become stable, we can estimate the
distribution of topics for the dth microblog by: P (t|w
d
) = ?
t
d
=
N
t
d
+?
N
d
+T?
. With the word alignment table
B
?
, we can rank companies for the dth microblog in unlabeled data by computing the scores:
Pr(c

|w
d
) ?
T
?
t=1
N
d

n=1
P (c

, l

, B
?
) ? P (t|w
d
)P (w
dn
|w
d
),
(7)
where P (w
dn
|w
d
) is the weight of the word w
dn
in the microblog content w
d
. In this paper, we use
inverse document frequency (IDF) score to estimate it. Based on the ranking scores calculated by Eq.(7),
we can extract the top-ranked targets for each microblog to users.
3 Experiments
In this section, we will introduce the experimental results and datasets we constructed for training and
evaluation. We will firstly describe the how we construct the datasets and their statistics. Then we
will introduce the experiment configurations and baseline methods. Finally, the evaluation results and
analysis will be given.
3.1 Datasets
We started by using Sina Weibo?s API
5
to collect public microblogs from randomly selected users. The
dataset contains 282.2M microblogs published by 1.1M users. We use RAW-Weibo to represent it in the
following sections. Based on the collected raw microblogs, we constructed three datasets for evaluation
and training.
3.1.1 Training data
Since social media users post thoughts, ideas, or status on various topics in social medias, there are a
huge number of related companies. Manually constructing training data is a time consuming and cost
process. In this work, we propose a weakly manual method based on ontology and hashtag. A hashtag is
a string of characters preceded by the symbol #. In most cases, hashtags can be viewed as an indication
to the context of the tweet or as the core idea expressed in the tweet. Hence, we can use hashtag as the
targets.
We extract the microblogs whose hashtags contain ontology items as training data and the
corresponding ontology items as targets. Obviously, the training data constructed based on this method
is not perfect. However, since this method can effectively generate a great quantity of data, we think
that general characteristics can be modeled with the generated training data. To evaluate the corpus,
we randomly selected 100 microblogs from the training data and manually labeled their targets. The
accuracy of the sampled dataset is 91%. It indicates that the proposed training data generation method
is effective. From the RAW-Weibo dataset, we extracted a total of 1.79M microblogs whose hashtags
contain more than one target. Training instances for 2,574 target companies are included in the training
data.

http://open.weibo.com/
692
3.1.2 Test data
For evaluation, we manually constructed a dataset RAN-Weibo, which contains 2,000 microblogs selected
from RAW-Weibo. Three annotators were asked to label the target companies for each microblog. To
evaluate the quality of annotated dataset, we validate the agreements of human annotations using Cohen?s
kappa coefficient. The average ? among all annotators is 0.626. It indicates that the annotations are
reliable.
Since some targets are ambiguous, inspired by the evaluation campaigns WePS-3 and RepLab 2013,
we also constructed a dataset AMB-Weibo, where microblogs include 10 popular company names which
may cause ambiguity. For each target, we randomly selected and annotated 200 microblogs as golden
standards. Three annotators were also asked to label whether the microblog is related the given target or
not. The agreements of human annotations were also validated through Cohen?s kappa coefficient. The
average ? among all annotators is 0.692.
3.2 Experiment Configurations
We use precision (P ), recall (R), and F1-score (F
1
) to evaluate the performance. We ran our model
with 500 iterations of Gibbs sampling. We use 5-fold cross-validation in the training data to optimize
hyperparameters. The number of topics is set to 30. The other settings of hyperparameters are as follows:
? = 50/T , ? = 0.1, ? = 20, ? = 0.5. The smoothing parameter ? is set to 0.8.
For baselines, we compare the proposed model with the following baseline methods.
? Naive Bayes (NB): The target identification task can be easily formalized as a classification task,
where each target is considered as a classification label. Hence, we applied Naive Bayes to model
the posterior probability of each target given a microblog.
? Support Vector Machine (SVM): The content of microblogs are represented as vectors and SVM
is used to model the classification problem.
? IBM1: Translation model (IBM model-1) is applied to obtain the alignment probability between
words and targets.
? TTM: Topical translation model (TTM) was proposed by Ding et al. (2013) to achieve microblog
hashtag suggestion task. We adopted it to estimate the alignment probability between words and
targets.
3.3 Experimental Results
We evaluate the proposed method from the following perspectives: 1) comparing the proposed method
with the state-of-the-art methods on the two evaluation datasets; 2) identifying the impacts of parameters.
Table 2 shows the comparisons of the proposed method with the state-of-the-arts discriminative
and generative methods on the evaluation dataset RAN-Weibo. ?Our? denotes the method proposed
in previous sections. ?Our w/o BG? represents the proposed method without background knowledge.
From the results, we can observe that the proposed method is better than other methods. Discriminative
methods achieve worse results than generative methods. We think that the large number of targets is
one of the main reasons of the low performances. The results of the proposed models with and without
ontology information also show that background knowledge can benefit both the precision and recall.
TTM achieves better performance than IBM1. It indicates that topical information is useful for this
task. The performances of our method are significantly better than TTM. It illustrates that our smoothing
method and incorporation of background knowledge are effective.
From the description of the proposed model, we can know that there are several hyperparameters in
the proposed model. To evaluate the impacts of them, we evaluate two crucial ones among all of them,
the number of topics T and the smoothing factor ?. Table 3 shows the influence of the number of topics.
From the table, we can observe that the proposed model obtains the best performance when T is set to
30. And performance decreases with more number of topics. We think that data sparsity may be one of
the main reasons. With much more topic number, the data sparsity problem will be more serious when

estimating topic-specific translation probability. Table 4 shows the influence of the translation probability
smoothing parameter ?. When ? is set to 0.0, it means that the topical information is omitted. Comparing
the results of ? = 0.0 and other values, we can observe that the topical information can benefit this task.
When ? is set to 1.0, it represents the method without smoothing. The results indicate that it is necessary
to address the sparsity problem through smoothing.
Figure 2 shows the results of different methods on the dataset AMB-Weibo. All the models are trained
with same dataset as the above experiments. From the results, we can observe that the F1-scores vary
from less than 0.40 up to almost 0.60. The performances? variations of other methods are also huge. We
think that training data size and difficulty level are two main reasons. The size of training data of different
targets vary greatly in the dataset. However, comparing with other method, the proposed method is the
most stable one. Comparing with other methods, the proposed method achieves better performance than
other methods for all targets.

Organization name disambiguation task is fundamental problems in many NLP applications. The task

(Amig?o et al., 2013) evaluation campaigns have also addressed
the problem from the perspective of disambiguation organization names in microblogs. Pedersen et

vector machines (SVM) classifier with various external resources, such as WordNet, metadata profile,
category profile, Google set, and so on. Kozareva and Ravi (2011) proposed to use latent dirichlet
allocation to incorporate topical information. Zhang et al. (2012) proposed to use adaptive method for
this task. However, most of these methods focused on the text with predefined surface words. The
documents which do not contain organization names or person names can not be well processed by these
methods.
To bridge the vocabulary gap between content and hashtags, Liu et al. (2012b) proposed to use
translation model to handle it. They modeled the tag suggestion task as a translation process from

document content to tags. Ding et al. (2013) extended the translation based method and introduced a
topic-specific translation model to process the multiple meanings of words in different topics. Motivated
by these methods, we also propose to use topic-specific translation model to handle vocabulary problem.
Based on the model, in this work, we incorporate the background knowledge information into the model.
5 Conclusions
To identify target companies of microblogs, in this paper, we propose a novel topical translation
model to achieve the task. The main assumption is that the microblog posts and targets describe
the same thing with different languages. We convert the target identification problem to a translation
process from content of microblogs to targets. We integrate latent topical information into translation
model to hand the themes of microblogs in facilitating the translation process. We also incorporate
background knowledge (such as product names, series, et al.) into the generation model. Experimental
results on a large corpus constructed from a real microblog service and a number of manually labeled
golden standards of easily ambiguous entities demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better
performance than other approaches.
