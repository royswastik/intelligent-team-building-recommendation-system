Abstract
The objective of this work is to
disambiguate transducers which have
the following form: T = R ?D and to
be able to apply the determinization
algorithm described in (Mohri, 1997).
Our approach to disambiguating
T = R ?D consists first of computing
the composition T and thereafter to
disambiguate the transducer T . We
will give an important consequence of
this result that allows us to compose
any number of transducers R with
the transducer D, in contrast to the
previous approach which consisted in
first disambiguating transducers D
and R to produce respectively D? and
R? , then computing T ? = R? ?D? where
T ? is unambiguous. We will present
results in the case of a transducer
D representing a dictionary and R
representing phonological rules.
Keywords: ambiguity, determinis-
tic, dictionary, transducer.
1 Introduction
The task of speech recognition can be
decomposed into several steps, where
each step is represented by a finite-
state transducer (Mohri et al, 1998).
The search space of the recognizer is
defined by the composition of trans-
ducers T = A ? C ?R ?D ?M . Trans-
ducer A converts a sequence of obser-
vations O to a sequence of context-
dependent phones.
Transducer C converts a sequence
of context-dependent phones to a
sequence of context-independent
phones. Transducer R is a mapping
from phones to phones which imple-
ments phonological rules. Transducer
D is the pronunciations dictionary.
It converts a sequence of context-
independent phones to a sequence of
words. Transducer M represents a
language model: it converts sequences
of words into sequences of words, while
restricting the possible sequences or
assigning a score to the sequences.
The speech recognition problem con-
sists of finding the path of least cost
in transducer O ? T , where O is a
sequence of acoustic observations.
The pronunciations dictionary rep-
resenting the mapping from pronun-
ciations to words can show an inher-
ent ambiguity: a sequence of phones
can correspond to more than one word,
so we cannot apply the transducer de-
terminization algorithm (an operation
which reduces the redundancy, search
time and possibly space). This prob-
lem is usually handled by adding spe-
cial symbols to the dictionary to re-
move the ambiguity in order to be
able to apply the determinization al-
gorithm (Koskenniemi, 1990). Never-
theless, when we compose the dictio-
nary with the phonological rules, we
must take into account special sym-
bols. This complicates the construc-
tion of transducers representing these
rules and leads to size explosion. It
would be simpler to compose the rules
with the dictionary, then remove the
ambiguity in the result and then apply
the determinization algorithm.
2 Notations and
definitions
Formally, a weighted transducer over a
semiring K = (K,?,?, 0?, 1?) is defined
as a 6-tuple T = (Q, I,?1,?2, E, F )
where Q is a finite set of states, I ?
Q is a finite set of initial states, ?1 is
the input alphabet, ?2 is the output
alphabet, E is a finite set of transitions
and F ? Q is a finite set of final states.
A transition is an element of Q??1?
?2 ?Q?K.
Transitions are of the form
t = (p(t), i(t), o(t), n(t), w(t)), t ? E
where p(t) denotes the transition?s
origin state, i(t) its input label, o(t)
its output label, n(t) the transition?s
destination state and w(t) ? K is the
weight of t. The tropical semiring
defined as (R+ ? ?, min,+,?, 0) is
commonly used in speech recogni-
tion, but our results are applicable
to the case of general semirings as well.
A path pi = t1 ? ? ? tn of T is an ele-
ment of E? verifying
n(ti?1) = p(ti) for 2 ? i ? n.
We can easily extend the functions p
and n to those paths:
p(pi) = p(t1), (1)
n(pi) = n(tn). (2)
We denote by P (r, s) the set of paths
whose origin is state r and whose des-
tination is state s. We can also extend
the function P to the sets R ? Q and
S ? Q:
P (R, S) =
?
r?R, s?S
P (r, s)
We can extend the functions i and o to
the paths by taking the concatenations
of the input and output symbols:
i(pi) = i(t1) ? ? ? i(tn), (3)
o(pi) = o(t1) ? ? ?o(tn). (4)
Definition 1 (unambiguous trans-
ducer, (Berstel, 1979))
A transducer T is said to be unam-
biguous if for each w ? ??1, there
exists at most one path pi in T such
that i(pi) = w.
Definition 2 (ambiguous paths)
Two paths pi and ? are ambiguous if
pi 6= ? and i(pi) = i(?).
Remark 1 : To remove the ambiguity
between two paths pi and ?, it suffices
to modify i(pi) by changing the first in-
put label of the path pi. This is done
by introducing an auxiliary symbol such
that: i(pi) 6= i(?).
Figure 1a shows an ambiguous
transducer. It is ambiguous since
for the input string ?s e [z]?, there
are two paths representing the out-
put strings {ces, ses}. In this figure,
?eps? stands for epsilon or null symbol.
To disambiguate a transducer, we
first group the ambiguous paths; we
then remove the ambiguity in each
group by adding auxiliary labels as
shown in Figure 1b. Unfortunately, it
is infeasible to enumerate all the paths
in a cyclic transducer. However, in
(Smaili, 2001) it is shown that cyclic
transducers of the type studied in this
work can be disambiguated by trans-
forming to a corresponding acyclic sub-
transducer such that T ? ? T . This

Figure 1: (a) Ambiguous transducer
(b) Disambiguated transducer
fundamental property is described in
detail in section 2.1. Accordingly, we
apply the appropriate transformation
to the input transducer.
2.1 Fundamental Property
We are interested in the transducer
T = (Q, I, ?, ?, E, F ) with ? =
?0 ] ?1 verifying the following prop-
erty:
Any cycle in T contains at least a
transition t such that i(t) ? ?1.
We denote by E0 and E1 the follow-
ing sets: E0 = {t ? E : i(t) ? ?0}
and E1 = {t ? E : i(t) ? ?1}. Notice
that E = E0 ] E1.
We can give a characterization of the
ambiguous paths verifying the funda-
mental property. Before, let?s make the
following remark:
Remark 2 Any path pi in T has the
following form:
pi = f0 pi0 f1 pi1 ? ? ?pin?1 fn pin
with pii ? E+0 , fi ? E+1 for 1 ? i ?
n, f0 ? E?1 and pi0 ? E?0 if n ? 1.
If n = 0 then pi = f0 pi0.
Proposition 1 (characterization of
ambiguous paths)
Let pi and ? be two paths such that:
pi = f0 pi0 f1 pi1 ? ? ?pin?1 fn pin and
? = g0 ?0 g1 ?1 ? ? ??k?1 gk ?k.
pi and ? are ambiguous if and only if
?
?
?
k = n
?i and pii are ambiguous (0 ? i ? n).
fi and gi are ambiguous (0 ? i ? n).
We will assume that the first transi-
tion?s path belongs to E0, i.e. f0 = .
Recall that if we want to avoid cy-
cles, we just have to remove from T
all transitions t ? E1. According to
Proposition 1, ambiguity needs to be
removed only in paths that use tran-
sitions t ? E0, namely the path pii
that performs the decomposition given
in Remark 2. Disambiguation consists
only of introducing auxiliary labels in
the ambiguous paths. We denote by
Asrc the set of origin states of transi-
tions belonging to E1 and by Adst the
set of destination states of transitions
belonging to E2.
Asrc = {p(t) : t ? E1}
Adst = {n(t) : t ? E1}
According to Proposition 1 and what
precedes, it would be equivalent and
simpler to disambiguate an acyclic
transducer obtained from T in which
we have removed all E1 transitions.
Therefore, we introduce the operator
? : {Tin} ?? {Tout} which accom-
plishes this construction.
Let T = (Q, I,?1,?2, E, F ). Then
?(T ) = (Q, I1,?1,?2, ET , F1) where:
1. I1 = I ? Adst ? {i}, with i 6? Q.
2. F1 = F ? Asrc ? {f}, with f 6? Q.
3. ET = E \E1?{(i, q, , , 0), q ?
I1} ? {(q, f, , , 0), q ? F1}.
The third condition insures the connec-
tivity of ?(T ) if T is itself connected.
It suffices to disambiguate the acyclic
transducer ?(T ), then reinsert the
transitions of E1 in ?(T ). The set of
paths in ?(T ) is then P(I1, F1).
2.2 Algorithm
Input:
T = (Q, i, X, Y, E, F ) is an
ambiguous transducer verifying the
fundamental property.
Output:
T1 = (Q, i, X ?X1, Y, ET , F ) is an
unambiguous transducer, X1 is the set
of auxiliary symbols.
1. Tacyclic ? ?(T ).
2. Path ? set of paths of Tacyclic.
3. Disambiguate the set Path (creat-
ing the set X1).
4. T0 ? build the unambiguous
transducer which has unambigu-
ous paths.
5. T1 ? ??1(T0) (consists of rein-
serting in T0 the transitions of T
which where removed).
6. return T1
Now, we will study an important
class of transducers verifying the fun-
damental property. This class is ob-
tained by doing the composition of a
transducer D verifying the fundamen-
tal property with a transducer R. The
composition of two transducers is an
efficient algebraic operation for build-
ing more complex transducers. We
give a brief definition of composition
and the fundamental theorem that in-
sures the invariance of the fundamental
property by composition.
3 Composition
The transducer T created by the com-
position of two transducers R and D,
denoted T = R?D, performs the map-
ping of word x to word z if and only
if R maps x to y and D maps y to z.
The weight of the resulting word is the
?-product of the weights of y and z
(Pereira and Riley, 1997).
Definition 3 (Transitions) Let t =
(q, a, b, q1, w1) and e = (r, b, c, r1,
w2) be two transitions. We define the
composition t with e by:
t ? e = ((q, r), a, c, (q1, r1), w1 ? w2).
Note that, in order to make the com-
position possible, we must have o(t) =
i(e).
Definition 4 (Composition)
Let R = (QR, IR, X, Y, ER, FR)
and S = (QS, IS, Y, Z, ES, FS) be
two transducers. The composi-
tion of R with S is a transducer
R ? S = (Q,Q,X, Z,E, F ) defined by:
1. i = (iR, iS),
2. Q = QR ?QS,
3. F = FR ? FS,
4. E = {eR?eS : eR ? ER, eS ? ES}.
Let D = (QD, ID, Y, Z, ED, FD) be a
transducer verifying the fundamental
property. We can write Y = Y0 ] Y1
where Y0 = {i(t) : t ? E0} and
Y1 = {i(t) : t ? E1}.
Theorem 1 (Fundamental) Let
R = (QR, IR, X, Y, ER, FR) verifying
the following condition:
(C) ?t ? ER, o(t) ? Y1 ? i(t) ? Y1.
Then the transducer T = R?D verifies
the fundamental property.
Proof :
Let X1 = {i(t) : t ? ER and o(t) ?
Y1} ? Y1 and X0 = X \ X1. We will
prove that any path in T contains at
least a transition t such that i(t) ? X1.
Let pi be a cycle in T . Then, there
exists two cycles piR and piD in R and
in D respectively such that pi = piR ?
piD. The paths piR and piD have the
following form:
piD = g1 ? ? ? gn,
with gi ? ED for 1 ? i ? n;
piR = f1 ? ? ? fn,
with fi ? ER for 1 ? i ? n;
pi = piR ? piD = (f1 ? g1) ? ? ? (fn ? gn).
There is an index k such that i(gk) ?
Y1 since D verifies the fundamental
property. We also necessarily have
i(gk) = o(fk) . According to condi-
tion (C) of Theorem 1, we deduce that
i(fk) ? Y1. Knowing that fk ? ER, we
deduce that i(fk) ? X1, which implies
i(fk ? gk) = i(fk) ? X1.
3.1 Consequence
The restriction to the case X = Y
allows us to build a large class of
transducers verifying the fundamental
property. In fact, if two transducers
R = (QR, IR, Y, Y, ER, FR) and S =
(QS, IS, Y, Y, ES, FS) verify the condi-
tion (C) of Theorem 1, then S ?R ver-
ifies the condition (C), associativity of
? implies:
S ? (R ?D) = (S ?R) ?D.
Suppose that we have m transducers
Ri ( 1 ? i ? m ) verifying the con-
dition (C) of Theorem 1 and that we
want to reduce the size of the trans-
ducer:
Tm = Rm ?Rm?1 ? ? ?R1 ?D.
To this end, we proceed as follows: we
add the auxiliary symbols to disam-
biguate the transducer; then we apply
determinization and finally we remove
the auxiliary labels. These three oper-
ations are denoted by ?.
Ti =
{
?(D) if i = 0.
?(Ri ? ?(Ti?1)) if i ? 1.
The size of transducer Tm can also
be reduced by computing:
Tm = ?(Rm ?Rm?1 ? ? ?R1 ?D).
The old approach:
T ?m = R
?
m ?R
?
m?1 ? ? ?R
?
1 ?D
?.
has several disadvantages. The size of
R?i for 1 ? i ? m increases consid-
erably since the auxiliary labels intro-
duced in each transducer have to be
taken into account in all others. This
fact limits the number of transducers
that can be composed with D.
4 Application and Results
We will now apply our algorithm to
transducers involved in speech recog-
nition. Transducer D represents the
pronunciation dictionary and possesses
the fundamental property. The set of
transitions of D is defined as
E = E0 ] {(f,#, x, 0, w)}
where f is the unique final state ofD, 0
is the unique initial state of D, x is any
symbol and # is a symbol represent-
ing the end of a word. All transitions
t ? E0 are such that i(t) 6= #. Any
path pi in E?0 is acyclic. The transducer
R representing a phonological rule is
constructed to fulfill condition (C) of
the fundamental theorem. The trans-
ducer D represents a French dictionary
with 20000 words and their pronuncia-
tions. The transducer R represents the
phonological rule that handles liaison
in the French language. This liaison,
which is represented by a phoneme ap-
pearing at the end of some words, must
be removed when the next word be-
gins with a consonant since the liaison
phoneme is never pronounced in that
case. However, if the next word begins
with a vowel, the liaison phoneme may
or may not be pronounced and thus be-
comes optional.

As we can see in Table 1, the opera-
tor ? produces a smaller transducer in
all the cases considered here.
5 Conclusion and future
work
We have been able to disambiguate
an important class of cyclic and am-
biguous transducers, which allows us
to apply the determinization algorithm
(Mohri, 1997); and then to reduce the
size of those transducers. With our
new approach, we do not have to take
into account the number of transduc-
ers Ri and their auxiliary labels as was
the case with the approach used be-
fore. Thus, new transducers Ri such
as phonological rules can be easily in-
serted in the chain.
The major disadvantage of our ap-
proach is that disambiguating a trans-
ducer increases its size systematically.
Our future work will consist of develop-
ing a more effective algorithm for dis-
ambiguating an acyclic transducer.
