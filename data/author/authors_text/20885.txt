Abstract 
The paper presents a system for tran-
scribing and annotating phonological in-
formation in Brazilian Portuguese, in-
cluding syllabification. An application of 
this system for the assessment of lan-
guage understanding and production is 
described, following a child longitudi-
nally, comparing expected production 
with observed production. 
1 Introduction 
We present an application of a phonological-
prosodic algorithm which converts Brazilian Por-
tuguese graphemes to phonological symbols. For 
a better understanding, a brief report about the 
origin of the algorithm, altogether with some 
theoretical comments are presented, before the 
case study of the phonological processes found 
in the speech samples of a child. Sessions were 
recorded, until the complete acquisition of all 
Portuguese phonemes by the child, which oc-
curred in the fifth session.  
In 2008, we created the first version of a pho-
nological-prosodic algorithm for Brazilian Por-
tuguese. Actually, it is the functional algorithm 
of the grapheme to phoneme converter Nhenh?m 
(Vasil?vski, 2008, 2012a, 2012b). It has all writ-
ten Portuguese spelling rules, and also the entire 
Portuguese prosodic system. When that algo-
rithm was built, we kept in mind its usefulness to 
different fields deeply related to phonology, such 
as speech therapy, allowing the study of children 
phonological disorders, and language acquisition. 
We focus here on its application to language 
acquisition, allowing the study of children pho-
nological acquisition processes. Hence, our ob-
jective is to show the phonological-prosodic al-
gorithm usefulness to language survey, from a 
practical point of view, by showing the process 
involved in the last stages of the acquisition of 
Portuguese phonology.  
For a better understanding of the application 
and of the case study, the paper starts with some 
theory on phonological acquisition, then, some 
aspects of Brazilian Portuguese acquisition are 
presented.  
2 Phonological Development 
Studies of first language acquisition tend to sup-
port the view that the ability for language is in-
nate in healthy human beings, and that its ap-
pearance can be predicted as part of the normal 
development of any child, given the right envi-
ronment (Beaken, 1971).  
The greatest expansion of the phonological 
system is observed from 1 year and six months 
old up to 4 years old, when there is an increase of 
the phonetic inventory of most complex syllable 
structures and, therefore, a period characterized 
by the occurrence of omissions, substitutions, as 
well as other phonological processes (Wertzner, 
2004). 
A phonological process is a mental operation 
that applies in speech to substitute, for a class of 
sounds or sound sequences presenting a specific 
common difficulty to the speech capacity of the 
individual, an alternative class identical but lack-
ing the difficult property (Stampe, 1973). 
It is worth remembering that, at the richest 
stage of normal language development (1 year 
and a half to 4 years old, as said), inappropriate 
sound gestures are expected phonological proc-
esses that relate to children?s adaptations, until 
they automate the adult speech patterns. Thus, 
the phonological processes ? that are natural and 
inborn ? guide the facilitation of complex vocal 
3
gestures and their planning, until children reach 
the adult performance. 
Moreover, the early-acquired competence is 
filtered through an increasing number of phono-
logical transformations to produce, finally, a ma-
ture performance. Although the mature phonemic 
system is acquired at an early stage, articulation 
may not be completely mature until after 7 years. 
Even though most children can be said to have 
mastered the complete set of potential phonemic 
oppositions of adult language by the age of 4 
years ? in other words, their phonological com-
petence is established ? yet, in adult terms, their 
performance falls short of their competence, in 
that they are unable to produce many of the ges-
tures of mature articulation of the phonemes. 
Development after this stage takes place in the 
maturing of articulation, and in the acquisition of 
the complex transformations which operate on 
the basic acquired competence, to produce forms 
of speech similar to those heard from mature 
speakers (Beaken, 1971). 
2.1 Some Aspects of Brazilian Portuguese 
Phonological Acquisition 
Regarding phonemes, Brazilian Portuguese has 
21 consonants (/p/, /b/, /f/, /v/, /m/, /n/, /t/, /d/, /s/, 
/z/, /l/, /?/, /r/, /?/, /?/, /?/, /?/, /k/, /g/, and the ar-
chiphonemes |R|, |S|), and 14 vowels (/a/, /e/, /?/, 
/i/, /o/, /?/, /u/, /j/, /w/, /?/, /?/, /?/, /?/, /?/) (Scliar-
Cabral, 2003a; C?mara Jr., 1986, 1977; Va-
sil?vski, 2012a).  
Lateral liquid phonemes /l/ and /?/ and non-
lateral liquid /r/ and /?/ are the latest to be ac-
quired in Brazilian Portuguese. Furthermore, 
such acquisition is marked by intense use of di-
versified phonological processes. What perhaps 
justifies this late acquisition, in Brazilian Portu-
guese as well as in other systems, is that this 
class is very complex, both in articulation and 
phonological aspects (Lamprecht, 2004).  
Within this group of sounds, lateral phonemes 
are acquired before the non-lateral ones. The first 
lateral phoneme to be stabilized by children is /l/, 
which is subdued before the emergence of the 
first non-lateral liquid phoneme /?/. This occurs 
with the phonemes /?/ ? graphically lh ? and /r/, 
being the first acquired before the second (Her-
nandorena and Lamprecht, 1997). In Portuguese, 
the phoneme /r/ occurs: 1) forming a syllable 
with an oral or nasal vowel (simple onset); 2) in 
second position of inseparable consonant clus-
ters, preceding oral or nasal vowel (complex on-
set); and 3) in syllable ending (coda, when it is 
the archiphoneme |R|). See Tab.1 for examples. 
In most cases, the acquisition of the phoneme 
/r/ happens initially in the position of simple on-
set (by 4 years old) and then in the position of 
complex onset (by 5 years old), the acquisition of 
the phoneme /r/ in coda position (that is, |R|) oc-
curs by 4 years old (Lamprecht, 2004) either.  
Another linguistic phenomenon to be taken 
into account is diphthongization. It happens 
when one vowel breaks into two segments, 
where the first one matches the original vowel 
and the second (/j/ or /w/) is harmonic with the 
nature of the triggering vowel. In Brazilian Por-
tuguese, one of the conditions when diphthongi-
zation occurs, and that matters here, is thus de-
fined: a stressed vowel, followed by a devoiced 
alveolar fricative [s], in the ending syllable of a 
word, becomes diphthongized by the addition of 
a second segment, an [i] (Cagliari, 2002). Since 
diphthongization is a strengthening process, it 
occurs preferentially with strong vowels, and, in 
Romance languages, /a/ is the strongest vowel, 
and /i/, the weakest (Foley, 1977). The semivow-
els of stressed syllables can be either produced or 
not in speech, both options belonging to Portu-
guese language system (Vasil?vski, 2012a). 
From the linguistic point of view, diphthongiza-
tion is strongly related to the geographical dia-
lectal variation (Leiria, 2000).  
3 A Program for Helping Language 
Acquisition Research 
By using Nhenh?m phonological-prosodic algo-
rithm, we built Nhenh?m Fonoaud ? NhFonoaud 
?, an application for assisting speech therapy, 
and so language acquisition. We began covering 
just one phonological process, called ?unvoiced-
ness?: a substitution of a voiced sound for an 
unvoiced one (e.g. /b/ ? /p/) (Blasi and Va-
sil?vski, 2011). Soon, we realized that the phono-
logical-prosodic algorithm could cover much 
more. 
 One of the motivations for creating such a 
system is that many Brazilian language acquisi-
tion researchers record their collected data using 
orthographic representation. As a result, those 
transcriptions are idiosyncratic and cannot be 
properly generalized, since they lack patterns. 
Data must be recorded in a phonologic-phonetic 
format, essential for these studies, since they ad-
dress phonological processes.  
According to researchers and speech thera-
pists, there is no similar work in Brazilian Portu-
guese. Probably, there are similar initiatives for 
4
other languages, and we expect to make com-
parisons soon.  
3.1 The decoder Nhenh?m Phonological-
prosodic Algorithm 
Nhenh?m (/??.????/) is a computational program 
that decodes Brazilian?s official writing system 
into phonological symbols and marks prosody 
(Vasil?vski, 2008, 2012a). In 2010, we aug-
mented its main algorithm, so the system became 
able of providing the phonological syllabic divi-
sion and the spelling syllabic division, with at 
least 99% of accuracy (see Vasil?vski, 2012a, 
2012b for more details). Then we developed an 
automatic syllable parsing (Vasil?vski, 2010).  
In 2012, we made some adjustments regarding 
morphology, and solved the unpredictable situa-
tions brought, for example, by the prefix ?trans-? 
that can be either decoded as /tr?z/ or /tr?s/, in 
consequence of resyllabification (see Vasil?vski, 
2012a). NhFonoaud benefits of all improvements 
obtained by the basic algorithm.  
3.2 Nhenh?m Fonoaud 
The application of Nhenh?m phonological-
prosodic algorithm to language acquisition and 
speech therapy has been presented (Blasi and 
Vasil?vski, 2011, Vasil?vski, 2012a, 2012b), but 
this is the first time that a case study is discussed.  
The first major challenge of working with 
phonemic transcription is the consistency of data. 
Different research questions require different 
levels of representation (Albert et al., 2013). In 
this regard, relying on an orthographic represen-
tation of speech, when dealing with language 
acquisition, does not make sense. 
The program supports the analysis of proc-
esses that occur in the child?s phonological sys-
tem, through the automatic phonological tran-
scription simultaneously to samples of the child 
speech recording. Thus, data relies on a phone-
mic representation of speech, automatically done 
by the algorithm, through Nhenh?m Fonoaud.  
NhFonoaud is designed for dealing with pho-
nological tests, using words wittingly grouped to 
analyze specific aspects of speech and phenom-
ena involved in its development. One of the tools 
of the program was the tests battery called Re-
ception and Production of Spoken Language As-
sessment (Scliar-Cabral, 2003b). These tests 
were elaborated for assessing overt symptoms of 
spoken language reception and production prob-
lems. The first step is assessing phonetic features 
perception, namely, the ability of distinguishing 
minimal pairs, what means distinguishing Brazil-
ian Portuguese words.  
The battery is composed by 81 pictures that 
represent specific words in Portuguese. The pic-
tures are grouped into cards of six elements each. 
There are 15 cards, and some pictures appear in 
more than one. Each card is assembled to address 
the perception and production of one specific 
phonetic feature: 1) /v/-/f/, /p/-/b/, /t/-/d/; 2) /k/-
/g/, /?/-/?/, /s/-/z/; 3) /m/-/n/, /t/-/d/, /s/-/f/; 4) /b/-
/g/, /f/-/r/, /k/-/p/; 5) /t/-/k/, |R|-/s/, /l/-/?/; 6) /t/-
/s/, /k/-|R|, /p/-/f/; 7) /d/-/t/, /t/-/r/, /d/-/s/; 8) /m/-
/b/, /n/-/r/, /z/-/n/; 9) /?/-/?/, /d/-/n/, /n/-/l/; 10) /r/-
/l/ (in three different contexts); 11) /?/-/?/, /i/-/u/, 
/e/-/o/; 12) /i/-/e/, /?/-/?/, /u/-/o/; 13) /e(j)/-/?/, /o/-
/?/, /?/-/o(w)/; 14) /?/-/a/, /m/-/b/ (in two different 
contexts)/; 15) /?/-/e/, /o/-/?/, /a/-/?/.  
In the reception battery, the speech therapist, 
behind the child, says the word and the child 
must point to one of the six pictures in each card. 
In the production battery, the speech therapist 
points to one of the six pictures in each card and 
the child must label it. 
While the child labels the picture, the re-
searcher can edit the canonical transcription pro-
vided by the program to match the child?s pro-
duction. For example, writing the lateral pho-
neme, when the child produces it, instead of the 
vibrating one.  
In principle, four situations may happen dur-
ing the assessment (Fig.1): the child does not 
recognize the  picture  (NR); the  child  gives  the

5
expected response (Correspondeu); the child 
gives an unexpected response (deviation ? Des-
vio); the child translates the word into his/her 
sociolinguistic variety (not deviation ? S?cio).  
NhFonoaud stores the records and compares 
them with the transcription expected, for generat-
ing reports. Hence, it is possible to build a cor-
pus, to retrieve it, grouping it according to date, 
situation, child?s age, type of card (test); then it 
is possible the conversion into numbers, using 
different formats, comparing the phonological 
transcription and the correspondent audio, and 
the recorded sessions. Therefore, it facilitates 
child?s progress monitoring. 
In spite of working with words, NhFonoaud 
can be adjusted to work with bigger texts, 
formed by many sentences. For the purpose of 
assessing the child phonemic system, using min-
imal pairs and small sentences is enough. 
3.3 Testing Nhenh?m Fonoaud  
The data analysis that we now present refers to a 
child in a clear process of language acquisition. 
It is based on oral emissions of a girl that we will 
call In?s. The 15 cards (Scliar-Cabral, 2003b) 
were applied, covering all the Brazilian Portu-
guese phonemes. Five sessions were recorded, 
starting when In?s was 2 years, 11 months, and 8 
days; until she was 3 years, 8 months and 29 
days.  
In?s was born in Curitiba, Brazil, of Brazilian 
parents. She was not considered to have signifi-
cant hearing loss. The child had developed some 
computer skills. Data was collected by her par-
ents, by showing her the cards at the computer, 
during a daily conversation. In?s had already 
contact with the pictures, and had learned some 
names that were not part of her daily life. The 
sessions were recorded by using the audio re-
sources of the same computer, and the records 
were clear enough to be used in this study.  
3.3.1 Testing results 
The results reveal the phonological processes 
used by In?s. Four were observed in her emis-
sions: two of substitution, one of deletion, and 
one of adding. From the reports generated by 
Nhenh?m Fonoaud, we created Tab 1. 
So, at the age of 2y11m8d, three phonological 
processes relate to a single phoneme of her 
mother tongue, the non-lateral, vibrating /r/, and 
another one to diphthongization. Thus, In?s is 
only unable to produce the most complex Portu-
guese phoneme, in anyone of the three cases in 
which it occurs. The first session reveals that the 
child is able to produce all the vowels (14) of her 
mother tongue and 20 consonantal phonemes 
among the 21 of Brazilian Portuguese. No 
changes are observed for about 4 months, but 
this is expected, since progress in language is

never regular; it may proceed at a fast rate for 
some periods while at others very little seems to 
be happening (Beaken, 1971). Then, the sound /r/ 
is emerging, only in simple onset, and she pro-
duces the cluster, but says /tl/ instead of /tr/ 
(3y6m25d). One month later (3y7m24d), she 
starts producing /r/ in coda position and the clus-
ter /tr/, with some difficult yet. The sound /r/ in 
simple onset is naturally produced. One more 
month (3y8m29d), and she is able to naturally 
produce /r/ in all the contexts it happens in Por-
tuguese, and keeps diphthongization.  
Regarding diphthongization, it happens when 
the child inserts the semivowel /j/ between a 
vowel and the coda |S|, creating a diphthong. 
This circumstance advises that the child is ad-
justing her speech according to adult speech, 
since the region where In?s lives is where this 
phonological phenomenon occurs most, consid-
ering the South of Brazil (Leiria, 2000). It is a 
trait of the child?s sociolinguistic variety, de-
pendent upon geographic factor, and so she 
keeps saying it. 
Hence, this research found that In?s completed 
the acquisition of the phonemes of her native 
language at 3 years and 8 months approximately, 
in normal development. 
4 Conclusion and Outlooks 
We briefly presented a system for dealing with 
phonological information in Brazilian Portu-
guese, and a case study from it, that is, the lon-
gitudinal speech recording of a child ? the girl 
called In?s. Data allowed to know the last 
processes involved in the acquisition of the 
phonemes of her mother tongue.   
From the preliminary results obtained, it is 
possible to conclude that Nhenh?m Fonoaud can 
be helpful to language acquisition research. Nev-
ertheless, the usefulness of the phonological pro-
sodic algorithm has to be proven, by testing it in 
different situations, such as deviant language 
acquisition, speech therapy, and also other re-
searches. This will be our next step.
