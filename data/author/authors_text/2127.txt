Abstract 
We describe a system, UNN-WePS for 
identifying individuals from web pages us-
ing data from Semeval Task 13. Our sys-
tem is based on using co-presence of per-
son names to form seed clusters. These are 
then extended with pages that are deemed 
conceptually similar based on a lexical 
chaining analysis computed using Roget?s 
thesaurus. Finally, a single link hierarchical 
agglomerative clustering algorithm merges 
the enhanced clusters for individual entity 
recognition. UNN-WePS achieved an aver-
age purity of 0.6, and inverse purity of 0.73. 
1 Introduction 
Guha and Garg (2004) report that approximately 
4% of internet searches are to locate named indi-
viduals. Yet, many people share the same name 
with for example 157630 individuals in the UK 
sharing the most common name ?David Jones? 
(UK statistics cited by Ash 2006). Consequently 
identifying web pages on specific individuals is a 
significant problem that will grow as everyone ac-
quires a web presence.  
There are several proposed approaches to identi-
fying which individuals correspond to which web 
pages. For example, Bollegala et al (2007) pro-
pose augmenting queries in the style of relevance 
feedback (Salton and Buckley 1990), Kalashnikov 
(2007) treat Web Person Search (WePS) as a dis-
ambiguation problem whose objective is to distin-
guish individuals, whilst Wan et al (2005) see 
WePS as a clustering problem. 
WePS has both similarities and differences to 
word sense disambiguation (WSD). Both seek to 
classify instances of usage, but in WSD the sense 
inventory is fixed. WSD then is more amenable to 
a classification solution where a system can be ef-
fectively trained using learning algorithms. In 
WePS we do not know from the outset how many 
individuals our pages correspond to. Consequently 
we took the view that WePS is better seen as a 
clustering rather than a classification problem. 
1.1 Ambiguity 
Ambiguity is a common feature of WePS and 
WSD.  There are multiple types of ambiguity in the 
relation between person names and entities that 
confound overly simple approaches. Firstly, note 
that some first names are also last names (Les Paul, 
Michael Howard), and that some last names also 
occur as given names (Woodrow Wilson Guthrie, 
Martin Luther King). Consequently, an overly 
simple name parser will easily be confused. Sec-
ondly many last names are also place names (Jack 
London, William Manchester). Thus, if a last name 
is not found in the names database, but is found in 
the gazetteer, a name can be confused with a loca-
tion. Finally, we come to toponym ambiguity, 
where the name of a place may correspond to sev-
eral locations. (For example, there are thirteen 
places called Manchester, multiple Londons, 
Washingtons etc.) Resolving toponyms is a re-
search problem itself (Leidner, 2004). 
1.2 Statistics 
Statistics are a further relation between WePS and 
WSD. We expect Zipf?s law (e.g. Adamic and 
Huberman 2002) to apply to the relation between 
402
web pages and individuals, meaning that relative 
frequency and rank form a harmonic series. In 
other words some people will be associated with 
many pages and increasingly more will be linked 
to fewer. This has a strong link to disambiguation, 
where an inaccurate algorithm may give inferior 
performance to the strategy of always selecting the 
most frequent sense. 
Now if we consider the types of data that distin-
guish individuals, we might find colleagues, 
friends, and family mentioned in web pages, in 
addition to locations, dates, and topics of interest. 
Of these, names are particularly useful, and we 
define co-present names as names found in a web 
page in addition to the name for which we are 
searching.  
Names are statistically useful, even though 
many people share the same name. For example 
there are 7640 individuals in the UK (for example) 
that share the most popular female name ?Margaret 
Smith?. Given the population of the UK is ap-
proximately 60 million, the probability of even the 
most common female name in the UK occurring 
randomly is 1.27+10-4 (of course not all the indi-
viduals have web pages).  
Now, Semeval WePS pages (Artiles 2007) have 
been retrieved in response to a search for one 
name. Often such web pages will contain addi-
tional names. The probability that a web page will 
contain two names corresponding to two different 
individuals is quite low (~ca 7x10-8). Conse-
quently co-present names form indicators of an 
individual?s identity. These give accurate seed 
points, which are critical to the success of many 
clustering algorithms such as k-means (Jain et al 
1999) 
1.3 Lexical Chain Text Similarity 
Not all WePS pages contain multiple names, or 
even content in any form. Consequently we need to 
distinguish between pages that are similar in mean-
ing to a page already in a seed cluster, those that 
refer to separate entities, and those to be discarded 
This was done by comparing the conceptual 
similarity of the WePS pages using Roget?s thesau-
rus as the conceptual inventory. The approach was 
described in Ellman (2000), where lexical chains 
are identified from each document using Roget's 
thesaurus. These chains are then unrolled to yield 
an attribute value vector of concepts where the 
values are given by repetition, type of thesaural 
relation found, and textual cohesion. Thus, we are 
not simply indexing by thesaural categories. 
Vectors corresponding to different documents 
can be compared to give a measure of conceptual 
similarity. Roget?s thesaurus typically contains one 
thousand sense entries divided by part of speech 
usage, giving a total of 6400 entries. Such vectors 
may be compared using many algorithms, although 
a nearest neighbor algorithm was implemented in 
Ellman (2000).  
1.4 One Sense Per Discourse 
UNN-WePS was based on a deliberate strategy 
that the success of an active disambiguation 
method needed to exceed its overall error rate in 
order to improve baseline performance. As such, 
simple methods that improved overall success 
modestly were preferred to complex ones that did 
not. Consequently, to reduce the search space, we 
used the ?one sense per discourse? heuristic (Gale 
et al 1992). This assumes that one web page 
would not refer to two different individuals that 
share a name. 
2 System Description 
UNN-WePS was made up of three components, 
comprising modules to: 
1. Create seed clusters that associated files 
with person names other than those being 
searched for. 
2. Match similarity of unallocated documents 
to micro clusters using lexical chains de-
rived from Roget?s thesaurus. 
3. Identify entities using single link agglom-
erative clustering algorithm. 
In detail, a part of speech tagger (Coburn et al 
2007) was used to identify sequences of proper 
nouns. Person names were identified from these 
sequences using the following simple names 
?grammar? coupled with data from the US Census 
(1990). 
 
Name = [Title*][Initials | 1st name]+[2nd name]+ 
Figure 1: Regular Expression Name Syntax  
We also used a gazetteer to forms seed clusters 
using data from the World Gazetteer (2007). This 
did not form part of the submitted system. 
 
403
In the second step, conceptual similarity was de-
termined using the method and tool described in 
Ellman (2000). Documents not allocated to seed 
clusters, were compared for conceptual similarity 
to all other documents. If similar to a document in 
a seed cluster, the unallocated document was in-
serted into the seed cluster. If neither document nor 
one to which it was similar too were in a seed clus-
ter, they were formed into a new seed cluster. Fi-
nally if document has 'meaningful' content, but is 
not conceptually similar to any other it is stored in 
a singleton seed cluster otherwise, it is discarded.  
In the final step, seed clusters were sorted by 
size and merged using a single link hierarchical 
agglomerative clustering algorithm to identify enti-
ties (Jain et al 1999). The use of a single link 
means that a document can only be associated with 
one entity, which conforms to the ?one sense per 
discourse? heuristic. 
Further details of the UNN-WePS algorithm are 
given in figure 2 below. 
 
3 Results 
UNN-WePS achieved an average purity of 0.6, and 
inverse purity of 0.73 in Semeval Task 13, achiev-
ing seventh position out of sixteen competing sys-
tems (Artiles et al 2007). However there was con-
siderable variance in UNN-WePS results as shown 
in graph 1 below.

Graph 1: UNN-WePS purity performance 
 
Graph 1 shows the purity scores for UNN-WePS 
on the Semeval 13 test data on three conditions: (1) 
as submitted (solid line), (2) using the gazetteer 
(dashed line), and (3) without the lexical chain 
based similarity matching (dotted line).  
Note although the purity is lower when similar-
ity matching is included the number of discarded 
documents is approximately halved. 
An examination of the data suggests that where 
performance was especially poor it was due to ge-
nealogical data. Firstly this contains multiple indi-
viduals sharing the same name violating the ?one 
sense per discourse? heuristic. Secondly genealogi-
cal data includes birth and death information which 
was outside the scope of UNN-WePS. Further-
more, the large number of names confounds the 
statistical utility of co-present names. 
4 Conclusion and Future Work 
We have described a system, UNN-WePS that dis-
ambiguates individuals in web pages as required 
for Semeval task 13 (Artiles et al 2007).  
UNN-WePS was composed of three modules. 
The first formed seed clusters based on names pre-
sent in web pages other than the individual for 
whom we are searching. The second used a lexical

chain based similarity measure to associates re-
maining files with clusters, whilst the third joined 
the clusters to identify identities using a single link 
hierarchical algorithm. 
UNN-WePS performed surprisingly well con-
sidering the simplicity of its basic seeding algo-
rithm. The use however of the ?one sense per dis-
course? heuristic was flawed. Names do re-occur 
across generations in families.  
Genealogy is a popular Internet pastime, and 
web pages containing genealogy data frequently 
refer to multiple individuals that share a name at 
different time periods. As UNN-WePS did not ac-
count for time, this could not be detected. Further-
more, the large number of names in on-line genea-
logical data does lead to spurious associations. 
As WePS was time limited, several extensions 
and refinements were envisaged, but not executed. 
Firstly, as described, the world gazetteer (2007) 
did not lead to performance improvements. We 
speculate therefore the disambiguation effect from 
using place names was exceeded by the ambiguity 
introduced by using them blindly. We note espe-
cially the inference between unidentified names (or 
street names, or building names) being interpreted 
as place data. 
A further system deficiency was the lack of rec-
ognition of date data. This is essential to differenti-
ate between identically named individuals in ge-
nealogical data. 
Finally, we are currently experimenting with dif-
ferent clustering algorithms using the CLUTO 
toolkit (Karypis 2002) to improve on UNN-WePS 
baseline performance.
