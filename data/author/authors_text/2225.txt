Abstract 
Spec is a critical issue for automatic chunking. 
This paper proposes a solution of Chinese 
chunking with another type of spec, which is 
not derived from a complete syntactic tree but 
only based on the un-bracketed, POS tagged 
corpus. With this spec, a chunked data is built 
and HMM is used to build the chunker. TBL-
based error correction is used to further 
improve chunking performance. The average 
chunk length is about 1.38 tokens, F measure 
of chunking achieves 91.13%, labeling 
accuracy alone achieves 99.80% and the ratio 
of crossing brackets is 2.87%. We also find 
that the hardest point of Chinese chunking is 
to identify the chunking boundary inside 
noun-noun sequences1.  
1 Introduction 
Abney (1991) has proposed chunking as a useful 
and relative tractable median stage that is to divide 
sentences into non-overlapping segments only 
based on superficial analysis and local information. 
(Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) represent chunking 
as tagging problem and the CoNLL2000 shared 
task (Kim Sang and Buchholz, 2000) is now the 
standard evaluation task for chunking English. 
Their work has inspired many others to study 
chunking for other human languages.  
Besides the chunking algorithm, spec (the 
detailed definitions of all chunk types) is another 
critical issue for automatic chunking development. 
The well-defined spec can induce the chunker to 
perform well. Currently chunking specs are 
defined as some rules or one program to extract 
phrases from Treebank such as (Li, 2003) and (Li, 
2004) in order to save the cost of manual 
annotation. We name it as Treebank-derived spec. 
However, we find that it is more valuable to 
compile another type of chunking spec according 
to the observation from un-bracketed corpus 
instead of Treebank.

 This work was done while Hongqiao Li was visiting 
Microsoft Research Asia. 
Based on the problems of chunking Chinese that 
are found with our observation, we explain the 
reason why another type of spec is needed and then 
propose our spec in which the shortening and 
extending strategies are used to resolve these 
problems. We also compare our spec with a 
Treebank-derived spec which is derived from 
Chinese Treebank (CTB) (Xue and Xia, 2000). An 
annotated chunking corpus is built with the spec 
and then a chunker is also constructed accordingly. 
For annotation, we adopt a two-stage processing, 
in which text is first chunked manually and then 
the potential inconsistent annotations are checked 
semi-automatically with a tool. For the chunker, 
we use HMM model and TBL (Transform-based 
Learning) (Brill, 1995) based error correction to 
further improve chunking performance. With our 
spec the overall average length of chunks arrives 
1.38 tokens, in open test, the chunking F measure 
achieves 91.13% and 95.45% if under-combining 
errors are not counted. We also find the hardest 
point of Chinese chunking is to identify the 
chunking boundary inside a noun-noun sequence. 
In the remainder of this paper section 2 describes 
some problems in chunking Chinese text, section 3 
discusses the reason why another type of spec is 
needed and proposes our chunking spec, section 4 
discusses the annotation of our chunking corpus, 
section 5 describes chunking model, section 6 
gives experiment results, section 7, 8 recall some 
related work and give our conclusions respectively. 
2 Problems of Chunking Chinese Text 
The purpose of Chinese chunking is to divide 
sentence into syntactically correlated parts of 
words after word segmentation and part-of-speech 
(POS) tagging. For example: 
[NP ?? /ns ?Zhuhai?] ? /u ?of? [NP ?? /a 
?solid? ??/n ?traffic? ??/n ?frame?] [VP ?/d 
?already? ? ?? ? /v ?achieve considerable 
scale ? ?/u]   ?Zhuhai has achieved considerable 
scale in solid traffic frame.? 
According to Abney?s definition, most chunks 
are modifier-head structures and non-overlapping. 
However, some syntactic structures in Chinese are 
very hard to be chunked correctly due to 
characteristics of Chinese language, for example, 
less using of function words and less inflection 
formats. Table 1 shows the most common 
structural ambiguities occurred during Chinese 
chunking. Their occurrences and distributions of 
each possible structure are also reported. As can be 
seen in Table 1, only 77% neighboring nouns can 
be grouped inside one chunk; if the left word is ??
/of? or a verb, this figure will ascend to 80% and 
94% respectively; but if the left word is an 
adjective or a numeral, it will descend to 70% and 
59% respectively; for ?n_c_n?, only 52%  are word 
level coordination. In contrast with English 
chunking, several hard problems are described in 
detail as following.  
(1) Noun-noun compounds 
Compounds formed by more than two 
neighboring nouns are very common in Chinese 
and not always all the left nouns modify the head 
of the compound. Some compounds consist of 
several shorter sub-compounds. For example: 
( ? ? /younger ??? /volunteer ? ?
/science and technology ???/service team)    
?young volunteer service team of science and 
technology? 
??? ???? and ??? ???? are two sub-
compounds and the former modifies the latter. 
But sometimes it is impossible to distinguish the 
inner structures, for example: 
??/world ??/peace ??/career  
It is impossible to distinguish whether it is {{?
? ??} ??} or {?? {?? ??}}. 
English chunking also shows such problem, and 
the common solution for English is not to identify 
their inner structure and treat them as a flat noun 
phrase. Following is an example in CoNLL2000 
shared task: 
[NP employee assistance program directors] 
(2) Coordination 
Coordination in all cases can be divided into two 
types: with conjunctions and without conjunctions. 
The former can be further divided into two 
subcategories: word-level and phrase-level 
coordinations. For example: 
{ ? ?? /policy ?? /bank ? /and ??
/commercial ? ? /bank} ? /of { ? ?
/relationship ?/and  ??/cooperation}    ?the 
relationship and cooperation between policy 
banks and commercial banks?. 
The former coordination is phrase-level and the 
latter is word-level. Unfortunately, sometimes it is 
difficult or even impossible to distinguish whether 
it is word-level or phrase-level at all, for example: 
?? /least ?? /salary ? /and ??? /living 
maintenance ?the least salary and living 
maintenance? 
It is impossible to distinguish ???? is a shared 
modifier or not. English chunking also has such 
kind of problems. The solution of CoNLL2000 is 
to leave the conjunctions outside chunks for 
phrase-level coordinations and to group the 
conjunction inside a chunk when it is word-level or 
impossibly distinguished phrase-level. For 
example: 
[NP enough food and water] 
In Chinese, some coordinate construction has no 
conjunction or punctuation inside, and also could 
not be distinguished from a modifier-head 
construction with syntactic knowledge only. For 
example: 
??/order (??/police wagon ??/caution 
light ???/alarm whistle)   ?Order the police

 n, v, a, d, m, q,  p, f , c are the POS tags of noun, verb, adjective, adverb, number, measure, preposition, localizer, 
conjunction respectively, ?_? means neighboring, ??/of? is a common auxiliary word in Chinese.  
2This statistical work is done on our test corpus whose setting is shown in Table 3. 
Table 1: The observation of several common structural ambiguities during Chinese chunking 
wagons, caution lights and alarm whistles? 
Such problem does not exist in English because 
almost all coordinations have certain conjunctions 
or punctuations between words or phrases of the 
same syntactic categories in formal English. 
(3) Structural ambiguities 
In Chinese, some structural ambiguities in 
phrase level are impossible or unnecessary to be 
distinguished during chunking. There is an 
example of ?a_n_n?: 
?? /a ?modern? ?? /n ?industry? ?? /n 
?system? 
{?? {?? ??}} or {{?? ??} ??} are 
identically acceptable. English also has such 
problem. The solution of CoNLL2000 is not to 
distinguish inner structure and group the given 
sequence as a single chunk. For example, the inner 
structure of ?[NP heavy truck production]? is ?{{heavy 
truck} production}?, whereas one reading of ?[NP 
heavy quake damage]? is ?{heavy {quake damage}}?. 
Besides, ?a_n_n?, ?m_n_n? and ?m_q_n_n? also 
have the similar problem. 
3 Chinese Chunking Spec 
As a kind of shallow parsing, the principles of 
chunking are to make chunking much more 
efficient and precise than full parsing. Obviously, 
one can shorten the length of chunks to leave 
ambiguities outside of chunks. For example, if we 
let noun-noun sequences always chunk into single 
word, those ambiguities listed in Table 1 would not 
be encountered and the performance would be 
greatly improved. In fact, there is an implicit 
requirement in chunking, no matter which 
language it is, the average length of chunks is as 
longer as possible without violating the general 
principle of chunking. So a trade-off between the 
average chunk length and the chunking 
performance exists. 
3.1 Why another type of spec is needed 
A convenient spec is to extract the lowest non-
terminal nodes from a Treebank (e.g. CTB) as 
Chinese chunked data. But there are some 
problems. The trees are designed for full parsing 
instead of shallow parsing, thus some of these 
problems listed in section 2 could not be resolved 
well in chunking. Maybe we can compile some 
rules to prune the tree or break some non-terminal 
nodes in order to properly resolve these problems 
just like CoNLL2000. However, just as (Kim Sang 
and Buchholz, 2000) noted: ?some trees are very 
complex and some annotations are inconsistent?. 
So these rules are complex, the extracted data are 
inconsistent and manual check is also needed. In 
addition, the resource of Chinese Treebank is 
limited and the extracted data is not enough for 
chunking. 
So we compile another type of chunking spec 
according to the observation from un-bracket 
corpus instead of Treebank. The only shortcoming 
is the cost of annotation, but there are some 
advantages for us to explore.  
1) It coincides with auto chunking procedure, 
and we can select proper solutions to these 
problems without constraints of the exist Treebank. 
The purpose of drafting another type of chunking 
spec is to keep chunking consistency as high as 
possible without hurting the performance of auto-
chunking in whole. 
2) Through spec drafting and text 
annotating most frequent and significant syntactic 
ambiguities could be studied, and those 
observations are in turn described in the spec 
carefully.  
3) With a proper spec and certain mechanical 
approaches, a large-scale chunked data could be 
produced without supporting from the Treebank. 
3.2 Our spec 
Our spec and chunking annotation are based on 
PK corpus2 (Yu et al 1996). The PK corpus is un-
bracketed, but in which all words are segmented 
and only one POS tag is assigned to each word. 
We define 11 chunk types that are similar with 
CoNLL2000. They are NP (noun chunk), VP (verb 
chunk), ADJP (adjective chunk), ADVP (adverb 
chunk), PP (prepositional chunk), CONJP 
(conjunction), MP (numerical chunk), TP 
(temporal chunk), SP (spatial chunk), INTJP 
(interjection) and INDP (independent chunk).  
During spec drafting we try to find a proper 
chunk spec to solve these problems by two ways: 
either merging neighboring chunks into one chunk 
or shortening them. Besides those structural 
ambiguities, we also extend boundary of the 
chunks with minor structural ambiguities in order 
to make the chunks close to the constituents. 
3.2.1 Shortening 
The auxiliary ??/of? is one of the most frequent 
words in Chinese and used to connect a pre-
modifier with its nominal head. However the left 
boundary of such a ? -construction is quite 
complicated: almost all kinds of preceding clauses, 
phrases and words can be combined with it to form 
such a pre-modifier, and even one ?-construction 
can embed into another. So we definitely leave it 
outside any chunk. Similarly, conjunctions, ??
/and?, ?? /or? and ?? /and? et al, are also left 
outside any chunk no matter they are word-level or

phrase-level coordinations. For instances, the 
examples in Section 2 are chunked as ?[NP ??? 
??] ? [NP?? ??] ? [NP ??] ?  [NP?
?]? and ?[ADJP ??] [NP ??]  ?  [NP ??
?]? 
3.2.2 Extending 
(1) NP 
Similar with the shared task of CoNLL2000, 
we define noun compound that is formed by a 
noun-sequence: ?a_n_n?, ?m_n_n? or ?m_q_n_n?, 
as one chunk, even if there are sub-compounds, 
sub-phrase or coordination relations inside it. For 
instances, ?[NP ?? ??? ?? ???]?, 
?[NP ?? ?? ??]?, ?[VP??] [NP?? ?
? ???]?, ?[NP ?? ?? ??] and ?[NP ?
? ?? ??]? are grouped into single chunks 
respectively. 
However, it does not mean that we blindly bind 
all neighboring nouns into a flat NP. If those 
neighboring nouns are not in one constituent or 
cross the phrase boundary, they will be chunked 
separately, such as following two examples in 
Table 1: ?[VP?] [NP ?] [NP??]? and ?[ADJP
??] ?/u [NP ??] [NP ??]?. So our solution 
does not break the grammatical phrase structure in 
a given sentence. 
With this chunking strategy, we not only 
properly resolved these problems, but also get 
longer chunks. Longer chunks can make 
successive parsing easier based on chunking. For 
example, if we chunked the sentence as: 
[NP ??] ? [NP ?? ??] [NP ??] [VP ? 
???? ?]  ?/w 
There would be three possible syntactic trees 
which are difficult to be distinguished: 
1a) {{ [NP ??] ? { [NP ?? ??] [NP ?
?]}} [VP ? ????]} 
1b) {{{ [NP ??] ? [NP ?? ??]} [NP ?
?]}  [VP ? ????]} 
1c) {{ [NP ??] ? [NP ?? ??]} { [NP ?
?]  [VP ? ????]}} 
Whereas with above chunking strategy of our 
spec, there is only one syntactic tree remained: 
{{[NP ??] ? [NP ?? ?? ??]} [VP ?  
???? ?]}  ?/w 
Another reason of the chunking strategy is that 
for some NLP applications such as IR, IE or QA, it 
is unnecessary to analyze these ambiguities at the 
early stage of text analysis. 
(2) PP 
Most PP consists of only the preposition itself 
because the right boundary of a preposition phrase 
is hard to identify or far from the preposition. But 
certain prepositional phrases in Chinese are formed 
with a frame-like construction, such as [PP ?/p 
?at? ??/f ?middle?], [PP ?/p ??/f ?top?], etc. 
Statistics shows that more than 90% of those 
frame-like PPs are un-ambiguous, and others 
commonly have certain formal features such as an 
auxiliary ?  or a conjunction immediately 
following the localizer. Table 2 shows the statistic 
result. Thus with those observations, those frame-
like constructions could be chunked as PP. The 
length of such kind of PP frames is restricted to be 
at most two words inside in order to keep the 
distribution of chunk length more even and the 
chunking annotation more consistent.  
 
Pattern1 No.of occurrence Ratio as a chunk 
p_*_f 45 93.33% 
P_*_*_f 36 97.22% 
*_f 40 92.50% 
*_*_f 9 77.78%

 This statistical work is also done on our test 
corpus and ?*? means a wildcard for a POS tag. 
Table 2: The ration of grouping these patterns 
as a chunk without any ambiguity  
(3) SP 
Most spatial chunks consist of only the 
localizer(with POS tag ?/s? or ?/f?). But if the 
spatial phrase is in the beginning of a sentence, or 
there is a punctuation (except ???) in front of it, 
then the localizer and its preceding words could be 
chunked as a SP. And the number of words in front 
of the localizer is also restricted to at most two for 
the same reason. 
(4) VP 
Commonly, a verb chunk VP is a pre-modifier 
verb construction, or a head-verb with its following 
verb-particles which form a morphologically 
derived word sequence. The pre-modifier is 
formed by adverbial phrases and/or auxiliary verbs. 
In order to keep the annotation consistent those 
verb particles and auxiliary verbs could be found in 
a closed list respectively only. Post-modifiers of a 
verb such as object and complement should be 
excluded in a verb chunk. 
We find that although a head verb groups more 
than one preceding adverbial phrases, auxiliary 
verbs and following verb-particles into one VP, its 
chunking performance is still high. For example: 
[CONJP ??/c ?if?] [VP ??/d ?lately? 
?/d ?not? ?/v ?can? ??/v ?build? ?/v 
?up?] [NP ??/n ?diplomat ??/n ?relation?] 
?If we could not build up the foreign relations 
soon? 
3.3 Spec Comparison 
We compare our spec with the Treebank-derived 
spec, named as S1, which is to extract the lowest 
non-terminal nodes from CTB as chunks from the 
aspect of the solutions of these problems in section 
2. Noun-noun compound and the coordination 
which has no conjunction are chunked identically 
in both specs. But for others, there are different. In 
S1, the conjunctions of phrase-level coordination 
are outside of chunks and the ones of word-level 
are inside a chunk, all adjective or numerical 
modifiers are separate from noun head. According 
to S1, the example in 3.2.1 should be chunked as 
following. 
[ADJP ???] [NP ??] ? [NP??] [NP ?
?] ? [NP ?? ?  ??] 
But these phrases that are impossible to 
distinguish inner structures during the early stage 
of text analysis are hard to be chunked and would 
cause some inconsistency. ?[ADJP ??] [NP ??] 
?  [NP ???]? or ?[ADJP ??] [NP ?? ? ?
??]?, ?[ADJP ??] [NP ??] [NP ??]? or 
?[ADJP ??] [NP ?? ??]?, are hard to make 
decisions with S1.  
In addition, with our spec outside words are only 
punctuations, structural auxiliary ? ? /of?, or 
conjunctions, whereas with S1, outside words are 
defined as all left words after lowest non-terminal 
extraction. 
4 Chunking Annotation 
Four graduate students of linguistics were 
assigned to annotate manually the PK corpus with 
the proposed chunking spec. Many discussions 
between authors and those annotators were 
conducted in order to define a better chunking spec 
for Chinese. Through the spec drafting and text 
annotating most significant syntactic ambiguities 
in Chinese, such as those structural ambiguities 
discussed in section 2 and 3, have been studied, 
and those observations are carefully described in 
the spec in turn.  
Consistency control is another important issue 
during annotation. Besides the common methods: 
manual checking, double annotation, post 
annotation checking, we explored a new 
consistency measure to help us find the potential 
inconsistent annotations, which is hinted by 
(Kenneth and Ryszard. 2000), who defined 
consistency gain as a measure of a rule in learning 
from noisy data.  
The consistency of an annotated corpus in whole 
could be divided down into consistency of each 
chunk. If the same chunks appear in the same 
context, they should be identically annotated. So 
we define the consistency of one special chunk as 
the ratio of identical annotation in the same context.

))(,(1cons(S)  (2) 
Where P represents a pattern of the chunk (POS 
or/and lexical sequence), context(P) represents the 
needed context to annotate this chunk, N represents 
the number of chunks in the whole corpus S. 
In order to improve the efficiency we also 
develop a semi-automatic tool that not only check 
mechanical errors but also detect those potential 
inconsistent annotations. For example, one inputs a 
POS pattern: ?a_n_n?, and an expected annotation 
result: ?B-NP_I-NP_E-NP3?, the tool will list all 
the consistent and inconsistent sentences in the 
annotated text respectively. Based on the output 
one can revise those inconsistent results one by one, 
and finally the consistency of the chunked text will 
be improved step by step. 
5 Chunking Model 
After annotating the corpus, we could use 
various learning algorithms to build the chunking 
model. In this paper, HMM is selected because not 
only its training speed is fast, but also it has 
comparable performance (Xun and Huang, 2000). 
Automatic chunking with HMM should conduct 
the following two steps. 1) Identify boundaries of 
each chunk. It is to assign each word a chunk mark, 
named M, which contains 5 classes: B, I, E, S (a 
single word chunk) and O (outside all chunks). 2) 
Tag the chunk type, named X, which contains 11 
types defined in Section 3.  
So each word will be tagged with two tags: M 
and X (the words excluding from any chunk only 
have M). So the result after chunking is a sequence 
of triples (t, m, x), where t, m, x represent POS tag, 
chunk mark and chunk type respectively. All the 
triples of a chunk are combined as an item ni, 
which also could be named as a chunk rule. Let W 
as the word segmentation result of a given sentence, 
T as POS tagging result and C (C= n1 n2?nj) as the 
chunking result. The statistical chunking model 
could be described as following:

In order to improve the performance we use N-
fold error correction (Wu, 2004) technique to 
reduce the error rate and TBL is used to learn the 
error correction rules based on the output of HMM. 
6 Data and Evaluation 
The performance of chunking is commonly 
measured with three figures: precision (P), recall 
(R) and F measure that are defined in CoNLL2000. 
Besides these, we also use two other measurements 
to evaluate the performance of bracketing and 
labeling respectively: RCB(ratio of crossing 
brackets), that is the percentage of the found 
brackets which cross the correct brackets; 
LA(labeling accuracy), that is the percentage of the 
found chunks which have the correct labels.

The average length (ALen) of chunks for each 
type is the average number of tokens in each chunk 
of given type. The overall average length is the 
average number of tokens in each chunk. To be 
more disinterested, outside tokens (including 
outside punctuations) are also concerned and each 
of them is counted as one chunk.

Table 4:The overall performance of chunking 
As can be seen, the performance of open test 
doesn?t drop much. For open test, HMM achieves 
6.9% F improvement, 3.4% RCB reduction on 
baseline; error correction gets another 2.7% F 
improvement, 0.3% RCB reduction. Labeling 
accuracy is so high even with the baseline, which 
indicates that the hard point of chunking is to 
identify the boundaries of each chunk.  
Table 5 shows the performance of each type of 
chunks respectively. NP and VP amount to 
approximately 76% of all chunks, so their 
chunking performance dominates the overall 
performance. Although we extend VP and PP, their 
performances are much better than overall. The 
performance of INDP can arrive 99% although it is 
much longer than other types. Because its surface 
evidences are clear and complete owing to its 
definition: the meta-data of a document, all the 
descriptions inside a pair of parenthesis, and also 
certain fixed phrases which do not act as a 
syntactic constituent in a sentence. From the 
relative lower performance of NP, but the most 
part of all chunks, we can conclude that the hardest 
issue of Chinese chunking is to identify boundaries 
of NPs.

Table 5:The result of each type with our spec 
All the chunking errors could be classified into 
four types: wrong labeling, under-combining, over-
combining and overlapping. Table 6 lists the 
number and percentage of each type of errors. 
Under-combining errors count about a half  
number of overall chunking errors, however it is 
not a problem in certain applications because they 
does not cross the brackets, thus there are still 
opportunities to combine them later with additional 
knowledge. If we evaluate the chunking result 
without counting those under-combining errors, the 
F score of the proposed chunker achieves 95.45%. 
Error type No.of the Errors Percentage 
Wrong labeling 22 2.56% 
Under-combine 418 48.71% 
Over-combining 339 39.51% 
Overlapping 59 6.88% 
 
Table 6:The distribution of chunking errors 
With comparison we also use some other 
learning methods, MBL(Bosch and Buchholz, 
2002), SVM(Kudoh and Matsumoto, 2001) and 
TBL to build the chunker. The features for MBL 
and SVM are the POS of current, left two and right 
two words, lexical of current, left one and right one 
word. TiMBL 4  and SVM-light 5  are used as the 
tools. For SVM, we convert the chunk marks 
BIOES to BI and the binary class SVM is used to 
classifier the chunk boundary, then some rules are 
used to identify its label. For TBL, the rule 
templates are all the possible combinations of the 
features and the initial state is that each word is a 
chunk. Table 7 shows the result. As seen, without 
error correction all these models do not perform 
well and our HMM gets the best performance.

6.2 Further applications 
The length of chunks with our spec (AoL is 1.38) 
is longer than other Treebank-derived specs (AoL 
of S1 is 1.239) and closer to the constituents of 
sentence. Thus there are several applications 
benefit from the fact, such as: 
1) The longest/full noun phrase identification. 
According to our statistics, due to including noun-
noun compounds, ?a_n_n? and ?m_n_n? inside NPs, 
65% noun chunks are already the longest/full  noun 
phrases and other 22% could become the longest 
/full noun phrases by only one next combining step. 
2) The predicate-verb identification. 
By extending the average length of VPs, the main 
verb (or predicate-verb, also called tensed verb in 
English) of a given sentence could be identified 
based on certain surface evidences with a relatively 
high accuracy. With certain definition our statistics 
based on our test set show that 84.88% of those 
main verbs are located in the first longest VPs 
among all VPs in a sentence.

7 Related Work 
For chunking spec, the CoNLL2000 shared task 
defines a program chunklink to extract chunks 
from English Treebank. (Li, 2003) defines the 
similar Treebank-derived spec for Chinese and she 
reports manual check is also needed to make data 
consistent. Part of the Sparkle project has 
concentrates on a spec based on un-bracketed 
corpus of English, Italian, French and 
German(Carroll et al, 1997). (Zhou, 2002) defines 
base phrase which is similar as chunk for Chinese, 
but his annotation and experiment are on his own 
corpus. 
For chunking algorithm, many machine learning 
(ML) methods have been applied and got 
promising results after chunking is represented as 
tagging problem, such as: SVM (Kudoh and 
Matsumoto, 2001), Memory-based (Bosch and 
Buchholz, 2002), SNoW (Li and Roth), et al. 
Some rule-base chunking (Kinyon, 2003) and 
combining rules with learning (Park and Zhang, 
2003) are also reported.  
For annotation, (Brants, 2000) reports the inter-
annotator agreement of part-of-speech annotations 
is 98.57%, the one of structural annotations is 
92.43% and some consistency measures. (Xue et 
al., 2002) also address some issues related to 
building a large-scale Chinese corpus. 
8 Conclusion 
We propose a solution of Chinese chunking with 
another type of spec that is based on un-bracketed 
corpus rather than derived from a Treebank. 
Through spec drafting and annotating, most 
significant syntactic ambiguous patterns have been 
studied, and those observations in turn have been 
described in the spec carefully. The proposed 
method of defining a chunking spec helps us find a 
proper solution for the hard problems of chunking 
Chinese. The experiments show that with our spec, 
the overall Chinese chunking F-measure achieves 
91.13% and 95.45% if under-combining errors are 
not counted.
