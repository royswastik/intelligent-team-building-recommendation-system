Abstract
This paper presents a multi-modal feature-
based system for extracting salient keywords
from transcripts of instructional videos. Specif-
ically, we propose to extract domain-specific
keywords for videos by integrating various
cues from linguistic and statistical knowledge,
as well as derived sound classes and charac-
teristic visual content types. The acquisition
of such salient keywords will facilitate video
indexing and browsing, and significantly im-
prove the quality of current video search en-
gines. Experiments on four government in-
structional videos show that 82% of the salient
keywords appear in the top 50% of the highly
ranked keywords. In addition, the audiovisual
cues improve precision and recall by 1.1% and
1.5% respectively.
1 Introduction
With recent advances in multimedia technology, the num-
ber of videos that are available to both general public and
particular individuals or organizations is growing rapidly.
This consequently creates a high demand for efficient
video searching and categorization as evidenced by the
emergence of various offerings for web video searching. 1
While videos contain a rich source of audiovisual in-
formation, text-based video search is still among the most
effective and widely used approaches. However, the qual-
ity of such text-based video search engines still lags be-
hind the quality of those that search textual information
like web pages. This is due to the extreme difficulty of
tagging domain-specific keywords to videos. How to
effectively extract domain-specific or salient keywords
1For example, see http://video.google.com and
http://video.yahoo.com
from video transcripts has thus become a critical and
challenging issue for both the video indexing and search-
ing communities.
Recently, with the advances in speech recognition
and natural language processing technologies, systems
are being developed to automatically extract keywords
from video transcripts which are either transcribed from
speech or obtained from closed captions. Most of these
systems, however, simply treat all words equally or di-
rectly ?transplant? keyword extraction techniques devel-
oped for pure text documents to the video domain without
taking specific characteristics of videos into account (M.
Smith and T. Kanade, 1997).
In the traditional information retrieval (IR) field, most
existing methods for selecting salient keywords rely pri-
marily on word frequency or other statistical informa-
tion obtained from a collection of documents (Salton and
McGill, 1983; Salton and Buckley, 1988). These tech-
niques, however, do not work well for videos for two rea-
sons: 1) most video transcripts are very short, as com-
pared to a typical text collection; and 2) it is impractical
to assume that there is a large video collection on a spe-
cific topic, due to the video production costs. As a result,
many keywords extracted from videos using traditional
IR techniques are not really content-specific, and conse-
quently, the video search results that are returned based
on these keywords are generally unsatisfactory.
In this paper, we propose a system for extracting salient
or domain-specific keywords from instructional videos
by exploiting joint audio, visual, and text cues. Specif-
ically, we first apply a text-based keyword extraction sys-
tem to find a set of keywords from video transcripts. Then
we apply various audiovisual content analysis techniques
to identify cue contexts in which domain-specific key-
words are more likely to appear. Finally, we adjust the
keyword salience by fusing the audio, visual and text cues
together, and ?discover? a set of salient keywords.
Professionally produced educational or instructional
109
videos are the main focus of this work since they are play-
ing increasingly important roles in people?s daily lives.
For the system evaluation, we used training and education
videos that are freely downloadable from various DHS
(Department of Homeland Security) web sites. These
were selected because 1) DHS has an increasing need for
quickly browsing, searching and re-purposing its learning
resources across its over twenty diverse agencies; 2) most
DHS videos contain closed captions in compliance with
federal accessibility requirements such as Section 508.
2 A Text-based Keyword Extraction
System
This section describes the text-based keyword extrac-
tion system, GlossEx, which we developed in our earlier
work (Park et al 2002). GlossEx applies a hybrid method,
which exploits both linguistic and statistical knowledge,
to extract domain-specific keywords in a document col-
lection. GlossEx has been successfully used in large-
scale text analysis applications such as document author-
ing and indexing, back-of-book indexing, and contact
center data analysis.
An overall outline of the algorithm is given below.
First, the algorithm identifies candidate glossary items by
using syntactic grammars as well as a set of entity recog-
nizers. To extract more cohesive and domain-specific
glossary items, it then conducts pre-nominal modifier
filtering and various glossary item normalization tech-
niques such as associating abbreviations with their full
forms, and misspellings or alternative spellings with their
canonical spellings. Finally, the glossary items are ranked
based on their confidence values.
The confidence value of a term T,C(T ), is defined as
C(T ) = ? ? TD(T ) + ? ? TC(T ) (1)
where TD and TC denote the term domain-specificity
and term cohesion, respectively. ? and ? are two weights
which sum up to 1. The domain specificity is further de-
fined as
TD =
?
wi?T
Pd(wi)
Pg(wi)
| T | (2)
where, | T | is the number of words in term T , pd(wi) is
the probability of word wi in a domain document collec-
tion, and pg(wi) is the probability of word wi in a general
document collection. And the term cohesion is defined as
TC = | T | ?f(T )? log10f(T )?
wi?T f(wi)
(3)
where, f(T ) is the frequency of term T , and f(wi) is the
frequency of a component word wi.
Finally, GlossEx normalizes the term confidence val-
ues to the range of [0, 3.5]. Figure 1 shows the normal-
ized distributions of keyword confidence values that we
obtained from two instructional videos by analyzing their
text transcripts with GlossEx. Superimposed on each plot
is the probability density function (PDF) of a gamma dis-
tribution (Gamma(?, ?)) whose two parameters are di-
rectly computed from the confidence values. As we can
see, the gamma PDF fits very well with the data distrib-
ution. This observation has also been confirmed by other
test videos.

3 Salient Keyword Extraction for
Instructional Videos
In this section, we elaborate on our approach for extract-
ing salient keywords from instructional videos based on
the exploitation of audiovisual and text cues.
3.1 Characteristics of Instructional Videos
Compared to general videos, professionally produced
instructional videos are usually better structured, that is,
they generally contain well organized topics and sub-
topics due to education nature. In fact, there are certain
types of production patterns that could be observed from
these videos. For instance, at the very beginning section
of the video, a host will usually give an overview of the
main topics (as well as a list of sub-topics) that are to
be discussed throughout the video. Then each individual
topic or sub-topic is sequentially presented following a
pre-designed order. When one topic is completed, some
informational credit pages will be (optionally) displayed,
followed by either some informational title pages show-
ing the next topic, or a host introduction. A relatively
long interval of music or silence that accompanies this
transitional period could usually be observed in this case.
To effectively deliver the topics or materials to an au-
dience, the video producers usually apply the following
types of content presentation forms: host narration, inter-
views and site reports, presentation slides and informa-
tion bulletins, as well as assisted content that are related
with the topic under discussion. For convenience, we call
the last two types as informative text and linkage scene
110
in this work. Figure 2 shows the individual examples of
video frames that contain narrator, informative text, and
the linkage scene.

formative text, and (c) linkage scene.
3.2 AudioVisual Content Analysis
This section describes our approach on mining the afore-
mentioned content structure and patterns for instructional
videos based on the analysis of both audio and visual in-
formation. Specifically, given an instructional video, we
first apply an audio classification module to partition its
audio track into homogeneous audio segments. Each seg-
ment is then tagged with one of the following five sound
labels: speech, silence, music, environmental sound, and
speech with music (Li and Dorai, 2004). The support
vector machine technique is applied for this purpose.
Meanwhile, a homogeneous video segmentation
process is performed which partitions the video into a
series of video segments in which each segment con-
tains content in the same physical setting. Two groups
of visual features are then extracted from each segment
so as to further derive its content type. Specifically, fea-
tures regarding the presence of human faces are first ex-
tracted using a face detector, and these are subsequently
applied to determine if the segment contains a narrator.
The other feature group contains features regarding de-
tected text blobs and sentences from the video?s text over-
lays. This information is mainly applied to determine if
the segment contains informative text. Finally, we label
segments that do not contain narrators or informative text
as linkage scenes. These could be an outdoor landscape, a
field demonstration or indoor classroom overview. More
details on this part are presented in (Li and Dorai, 2005).
The audio and visual analysis results are then inte-
grated together to essentially assign a semantic audiovi-
sual label to each video segment. Specifically, given a
segment, we first identify its major audio type by finding
the one that lasts the longest. Then, the audio and visual
labels are integrated in a straightforward way to reveal its
semantics. For instance, if the segment contains a narra-
tor while its major audio type is music, it will be tagged
as narrator with music playing. A total of fifteen possi-
ble constructs is thus generated, coming from the com-
bination of three visual labels (narrator, informative text
and linkage scene) and five sound labels (speech, silence,
music, environmental sound, and speech with music).
3.3 AudioVisual and Text Cues for Salient Keyword
Extraction
Having acquired video content structure and segment
content types, we now extract important audiovisual cues
that imply the existence of salient keywords. Specifically,
we observe that topic-specific keywords are more likely
appearing in the following scenarios (a.k.a cue context):
1) the first N1 sentences of segments that contain narra-
tor presentation (i.e. narrator with speech), or informa-
tive text with voice-over; 2) the first N2 sentences of a
new speaker (i.e. after a speaker change); 3) the question
sentence; 4) the first N2 sentences right after the ques-
tion (i.e. the corresponding answer); and 5) the first N2
sentences following the segments that contain silence, or
informative text with music. Specifically, the first 4 cues
conform with our intuition that important content sub-
jects are more likely to be mentioned at the beginning part
of narration, presentation, answers, as well as in ques-
tions; while the last cue corresponds to the transitional
period between topics. Here, N1 is a threshold which
will be automatically adjusted for each segment during
the process. Specifically, we set N1 to min(SS, 3) where
SS is the number of sentences that are overlapped with
each segment. In contrast, N2 is fixed to 2 for this work
as it is only associated with sentences.
Note that currently we identify the speaker changes
and question sentences by locating the signature charac-
ters (such as ?>>? and ???) in the transcript. However,
when this information is unavailable, numerous exist-
ing techniques on speaker change detection and prosody
analysis could be applied to accomplish the task (Chen
et al, 1998).
3.4 Keyword Salience Adjustment
Now, given each keyword (K) obtained from GlossEx,
we recalculate its salience by considering the following
three factors: 1) its original confidence value assigned by
GlossEx (CGlossEx(K)); 2) the frequency of the keyword
occurring in the aforementioned cue context (Fcue(K));
and 3) the number of component words in the keyword
(|K|). Specifically, we give more weight or incentive
(I(K)) to keywords that are originally of high confi-
dence, appear more frequently in cue contexts, and have
multiple component words. Note that if keyword K does
not appear in any cue contexts, its incentive value will be
zero.
Figure 3 shows the detailed incentive calculation steps.
Here, mode and ? denote the mode and standard devia-
tion derived from the GlossEx ?s confidence value distri-
bution. MAX CONFIDENCE is the maximum con-
fidence value used for normalization by GlossEx, which
is set to 3.5 in this work. As we can see, the three afore-
mentioned factors have been re-transformed into C(K),
F (K) and L(K), respectively. Please also note that we
111
have re-adjusted the frequency of keyword K in the cue
context if it is larger than 10. This intends to reduce the
biased influence of a high frequency. Finally, we add a
small value ? to |K| and Fcue respectively in order to
avoid zero values for F (K) and L(K). Now, we have
similar value scales for F (K) and L(K) ([1.09, 2.xx])
and C(K) ([0, 2.yy]), which is desirable.
As the last step, we boost keyword K?s original
salience CGlossEx(K) by I(K).
if (CGlossEx(K) >= mode
C(K) = CGlossEx(K)mode
else C(K) = CGlossEx(K)MAX CONFIDENCE
if ( Fcue(K) > 10)
Fcue(K) = 10 + log10(Fcue(K)? 10)
F (K) = ln(Fcue(K) + ?)
L(K) = ln(|K|+ ?)
I(K) = ? ? C(K)? F (K)? L(K)

word K appearing in cue context
4 Experimental Results
Four DHS videos were used in the experiment, which
contain diverse topics ranging from bio-terrorism history,
weapons of mass destruction, to school preparation for
terrorism. The video length also varies a lot from 30
minutes to 2 hours. Each video also contains a variety of
sub-topics. Video transcripts were acquired by extracting
the closed captions with our own application.
To evaluate system performance, we compare the key-
words generated from our system against the human-
generated gold standard. Note that for this experiment,
we only consider nouns and noun phrases as keywords.
To collect the ground truth, we invited a few human eval-
uators, showed them the four test videos, and presented
them with all candidate keywords extracted by GlossEx.
We then asked them to label all keywords that they con-
sidered to be domain-specific, which is guidelined by the
following question: ?would you be satisfied if you get this
video when you use this keyword as a search term??.
Table 1 shows the number of candidate keywords and
manually labeled salient keywords for all four test videos.
As we can see, approximately 50% of candidate key-
words were judged to be domain-specific by humans.
Based on this observation, we selected the top 50% of
highly ranked keywords based on the adjusted salience,
and examined their presence in the pool of salient key-
words for each video. As a result, an average of 82%
of salient keywords were identified within these top 50%
of re-ranked keywords. In addition, the audiovisual cues
improve precision and recall by 1.1% and 1.5% respec-
tively.

5 Conclusion and Future Work
We described a mutimodal feature-based system for ex-
tracting salient keywords from instructional videos. The
system utilizes a richer set of information cues which not
only include linguistic and statistical knowledge but also
sound classes and characteristic visual content types that
are available to videos. Experiments conducted on the
DHS videos have shown that incorporating multimodal
features for extracting salient keywords from videos is
useful.
Currently, we are performing more sophisticated ex-
periments on different ways to exploit additional audio-
visual cues. There is also room for improving the calcu-
lation of the incentive values of keywords. Our next plan
is to conduct an extensive comparison between GlossEx
and the proposed scheme.

Abstract
In this paper, we propose novel struc-
tured language modeling methods for code
mixing speech recognition by incorporat-
ing a well-known syntactic constraint for
switching code, namely the Functional
Head Constraint (FHC). Code mixing data
is not abundantly available for training
language models. Our proposed meth-
ods successfully alleviate this core prob-
lem for code mixing speech recognition
by using bilingual data to train a struc-
tured language model with syntactic con-
straint. Linguists and bilingual speakers
found that code switch do not happen be-
tween the functional head and its comple-
ments. We propose to learn the code mix-
ing language model from bilingual data
with this constraint in a weighted finite
state transducer (WFST) framework. The
constrained code switch language model is
obtained by first expanding the search net-
work with a translation model, and then
using parsing to restrict paths to those per-
missible under the constraint. We im-
plement and compare two approaches -
lattice parsing enables a sequential cou-
pling whereas partial parsing enables a
tight coupling between parsing and fil-
tering. We tested our system on a lec-
ture speech dataset with 16% embedded
second language, and on a lunch conver-
sation dataset with 20% embedded lan-
guage. Our language models with lattice
parsing and partial parsing reduce word
error rates from a baseline mixed lan-
guage model by 3.8% and 3.9% in terms
of word error rate relatively on the aver-
age on the first and second tasks respec-
tively. It outperforms the interpolated lan-
guage model by 3.7% and 5.6% in terms of
word error rate relatively, and outperforms
the adapted language model by 2.6% and
4.6% relatively. Our proposed approach
avoids making early decisions on code-
switch boundaries and is therefore more
robust. We address the code switch data
scarcity challenge by using bilingual data
with syntactic structure.
1 Introduction
In multilingual communities, it is common for
people to mix two or more languages in their
speech. A single sentence spoken by bilingual
speakers often contains the main, matrix language
and an embedded second language. This type
of linguistic phenomenon is called ?code switch-
ing? by linguists. It is increasingly important for
automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems to
recognize code switching speech as they exist in
scenarios such as meeting and interview speech,
lecture speech, and conversational speech. Code
switching is common among bilingual speakers of
Spanish-English, Hindi-English, Chinese-English,
and Arabic-English, among others. In China,
lectures, meetings and conversations with techni-
cal contents are frequently peppered with English
terms even though the general population is not
considered bilingual in Chinese and English. Un-
like the thousands and tens of thousands of hours
of monolingual data available to train, for exam-
ple, voice search engines, transcribed code switch
data necessary for training language models is
hard to come by. Code switch language modeling
is therefore an even harder problem than acoustic
modeling.
One approach for code switch speech recogni-
tion is to explicitly recognizing the code switch
points by language identification first using pho-
netic or acoustic information, before applying
speech recognizers for the matrix and embed-
ded languages (Chan et. al, 2004; Shia et. al,
907
2004; Lyu and Lyu, 2008). This approach is ex-
tremely error-prone as language identification at
each frame of the speech is necessary and any er-
ror will be propagated in the second speech recog-
nition stage leading to fatal and irrecoverable er-
rors.
Meanwhile, there are two general approaches to
solve the problem of lack of training data for lan-
guage modeling. In a first approach, two language
models are trained from both the matrix and em-
bedded language separately and then interpolated
together (Vu et. al, 2012; Chan et. al, 2006). How-
ever, an interpolated language model effectively
allows code switch at all word boundaries without
much of a constraint. Another approach is to adapt
the matrix language language model with a small
amount of code switch data (Tsai et. al, 2010; Yeh
et. al, 2010; Bhuvanagiri and Kopparapu, 2010;
Cao et. al, 2010). The effectiveness of adapta-
tion is also limited as positions of code switch-
ing points are not generalizable from the limited
data. Significant progress in speech recognition
has been made by using deep neural networks for
acoustic modeling and language model. However,
improvement thus gained on code switch speech
recognition remains very small. Again, we pro-
pose that syntactic constraints of the code switch-
ing phenomenon can help improve performance
and model accuracy. Previous work of using part-
of-speech tags (Zhang et. al, 2008; Vu et al 2012)
and our previous work using syntactic constraints
(Li and Fung, 2012, 2013) have made progress
in this area. Part-of-speech is relatively weak in
predicting code switching points. It is generally
accepted by linguists that code switching follows
the so-called Functional Head Constraint, where
words on the nodes of a syntactic sub tree must
follow the language of that of the headword. If the
headword is in the matrix language then none of
its complements can switch to the embedded lan-
guage.
In this work, we propose two ways to incorpo-
rate the Functional Head Constraint into speech
recognition and compare them. We suggest two
approaches of introducing syntactic constraints
into the speech recognition system. One is to ap-
ply the knowledge sources in a sequential order.
The acoustic model and a monolingual language
model are used first to produce an intermediate
lattice, then a second pass choose the best result
using the syntactic constraints. Another approach
uses tight coupling. We propose using structured
language model (Chelba and Jelinek, 2000) to
build the syntactic structure incrementally.
Following our previous work, we suggest in-
corporating the acoustic model, the monolingual
language model and a translation model into a
WFST framework. Using a translation model al-
lows us to learn what happens when a language
switches to another with context information. We
will motivate and describe this WFST framework
for code switching speech recognition in the next
section. The Functional Head Constraint is de-
scribed in Section 3. The proposed code switch
language models and speech recognition coupling
is described in Section 4. Experimental setup and
results are presented in Section 5. Finally we con-
clude in Section 6.
2 Code Switch Language Modeling in a
WFST Framework
As code switch text data is scarce, we do not have
enough data to train the language model for code
switch speech recognition. We propose instead to
incorporate language model trained in the matrix
language with a translation model to obtain a code
switch language model. We propose to integrate a
bilingual acoustic model (Li et. al, 2011) and the
code switch language model in a weighted finite
state transducer framework as follows.
Suppose X denotes the observed code switch
speech vector, w

matrix language, the hypothesis transcript v

where P (X|v

is the language model in the mixed language.
Our code switch language model is obtained
from a translation model P (v

Instead of word-to-word translation, the trans-
duction of the context dependent lexicon trans-
fer is constrained by previous words. Assume the

There are C-level and H-level search networks
in the WFST framework. The C-level search net-
work is composed of the universal phone model
P , the context model C, the lexicon L, and the
grammar G
N = P ? C ? L ?G (3)
The H-level search network is composed of the
state model H , the phoneme model P , the context
model C, the lexicon L, and the grammar G
N = H ? P ? C ? L ?G (4)
The C-level requires less memory then the H-level
search network. We propose to use a weighted fi-
nite state transducer framework incorporating the
bilingual acoustic model P , the context model C,
the lexicon L, and the code switching language
models G
CS
into a C-level search network for
mixed language speech recognition. The output
of the recognition result is in the mixed language
after projection pi(G
CS
).

The WFST implementation to obtain the code

is code-switched to the embedded lan-

a chunk to be code switched to the embedded lan-
guage trained on parallel data. The reconstruction
model generates word sequence from chunk se-
quences and operates in the opposite direction to
the segmentation model.
3 Functional Head Constraint
Many linguistics (Abney 1986; Belazi et. al, 1994;
Bhatt 1994) have discovered the so-called Func-
tional Head Constraint in code switching. They
have found that code switches between a func-
tional head (a complementizer, a determiner, an
inflection, etc.) and its complement (sentence,
noun-phrase, verb-phrase) do not happen in natu-
ral speech. In addition, the Functional Head Con-
straint is language independent.
In this work, we propose to investigate and
incorporate the Functional Head Constraint into
code switching language modeling in a WFST
framework. Figure 1 shows one of the Functional
Head Constraint examples. Functional heads are
909
the roots of the sub trees and complements are part
of the sub trees. Actual words are the leaf nodes.
According to the Functional Head Constraint, the
leave nodes of a sub tree must be in either the
matrix language or embedded language, following
the language of the functional head. For instance,
the third word ???/something? is the head of
the constituents ???/very ???/important ?
?/something?. These three constituent words
cannot be switched. Thus, it is not permissible
to code switch in the constituent. More precisely,
the language of the constituent is constrained to be
the same as the language of the headword. In the
following sections, we describe the integration of
the Functional Head Constraint and the language
model.
We have found this constraint to be empirically
sound as we look into our collected code mixing
speech and language data. The only violation of
the constraint comes from rare cases of borrowed
words such as brand names with no translation in
the local, matrix language. Borrowed words are
used even by monolingual speakers so they are in
general part of the matrix language lexicon and
require little, if any, special treatment in speech
recognition.
In the following sections, we describe the inte-
gration of Functional Head Constraint and the lan-
guage model.
4 Code Switching Language Modeling
with Functional Head Constraint
We propose two approaches of language model-
ing with Functional Head Constraint: 1) lattice-
parsing and sequential-coupling (Chapplerler et.
al, 1999); 2) partial-parsing and tight-coupling
(Chapplerler et. al, 1999). The two approaches
will be described in the followed sections.
4.1 Sequential-coupling by Lattice-based
Parsing
In this first approach, the acoustic models, the
code switch language model and the syntactic con-
straint are incorporated in a sequential order to
progressively constrain the search. The acoustic
models and the matrix language model are used
first to produce an intermediate output. The in-
termediate output is a lattice in which word se-
quences are compactly presented. Lattice-based
parsing is used to expand the word lattice gener-
ated from the first decoding step according to the
Functional Head Constraint.
We have reasons to use word lattice instead
of N-best hypothesis. The number of hypothesis
of word lattice is larger than N-best hypothesis.
Moreover, different kinds of errors correspond to
the language model would be observed if N-best
list is extracted after the first decoding step. The
second pass run over the N-best list will prevent
the language model with Functional Head Con-
straint from correcting the errors. In order to ob-
tain a computational feasible number of hypothe-
ses without bias to the language model in the first
decoding step, word lattice is used as the interme-
diate output of the first decoding step.
A Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar (PCFG)
parser is trained on Penn Treebank data. The
PCFG parser is generalized to take the lattice gen-
erated by the recognizer as the input. Figure 2 il-
lustrates a word lattice which is a compact repre-
sentation of the hypothesis transcriptions of a an
input sentence. All the nodes of the word-lattice
are ordered by increasing depth.
A CYK table is obtained by associating the arcs
with their start and end states in the lattice instead
of their sentence position and initialized all the
cells in the table corresponding to the arcs (Chap-
plerler et. al, 1999). Each cell C
k,j
of the ta-
ble is filled by a n-tuple of the non-terminal A,
the length k and the starting position of the word
sequence w
j
...w
j+k
if there exists a PCFG rule
A? w
j
...w
j+k
, where A is a non-terminal which
parse sequences of words w
j
...w
j+k
. In order to
allow all hypothesis transcriptions of word lattice
to be taken into account, multiple word sequences
of the same length and starting point are initialized
in the same cell. Figure 2 mapped the word lattice
of the example to the table, where the starting node
label of the arc is the column index and the length
of the arc is the row index.
The sequential-coupling by lattice-parsing con-
sists of the standard cell-filling and the self-filling
steps. First, the cells C
k,j
and C
i?k,j+k
are com-
bined to produce a new interpretation for cell C
i,j
. In order to handle the unary context-free produc-
tion A ? B and update the cells after the stan-
dard cell-filling, a n-tuple of A, i and j is added
for each n-tuple of the non-terminal B, the length
i and the start j in the cell C
i,j
. The parse trees
extracted are associated with the input lattice from
the table starting from the non-terminal label of
the top cell. After the parse tree is obtained, we re-

cursively enumerate all its subtrees. Each subtree
is able to code-switch to the embedded language
with a translation probability P
l
(v?
l
|w
l
).
The lattice parsing operation consists of the an
encoding of a given word sequence along with
a parse tree (W,T ) and a sequence of elemen-
tary model actions. In order to obtain a correct
probability assignment P (W,T ) one simply as-
sign proper conditional probabilities to each tran-
sition in the weighted finite states.
The probability of a parse T of a word sequence
WP (W,T ) can be calculated as the product of the
probabilities of the subtrees.
P (W,T ) =

...w
k
is the first k words in the
sentence, and (W
k
, T
k
) is the word-and-parse k-
prefix. The probability of the n-tuple of the non-
terminal A, the length i and the starting position j
is the probability of the subtree corresponding to
A parsing throughout the sequence w
j
...w
j+i?1
.
The probability of the partial parsing is the product
of probabilities of the subtree parses it is made of.
The probability of an n-tuple is the maximum over
the probabilities of probable parsing path.
The N most probable parses are obtained during
the lattice-parsing.
The probability of a sentence is computed by
adding on the probability of each new context-free
rule in the sentences.
4.2 Tight-coupling by Incremental Parsing
To integrate the acoustic models, language model
and the syntactic constraint in time synchronous
decoding, an incremental operation is used in this
approach. The final word-level probability as-
signed by our model is calculated using the acous-
tic models, the matrix language model, the struc-
tured language model and the translation model.
The structured language model uses probabilistic
parameterization of a shift-reduce parse (Chelba
and Jelinek, 2000). The tight-coupled language
model consists of three transducers, the word pre-
dictor, the tagger and the constructor. As shown
in Figure 3, W
k
= w0...wk is the first k words of
the sentence, T
k
contains only those binary sub-
trees whose leaves are completely included inW
k
,
excluding w
0
=<s>. Single words along with
their POS tag can be regarded as root-only trees.
The exposed head h
k
is a pair of the headword
of the constituent W
k
and the non-terminal label.
The exposed head of single words are pairs of the
words and their POS tags.
Given the word-and-parse (k-1)-prefix
W
k?1
T
k?1
, the new word w
k
is predicted by
the word-predictor P (w
k
|W
k?1
T
k?1
). Taking
the word-and-parse k ? 1-prefix and the next
word as input, the tagger P (t
k
|w
k
,W
k?1
T
k?1
)
gives the POS tag t
k
of the word w
k
. Constructor
P (p
k
i
|W
k
T
k
) assigns a non-terminal label to the
constituent W
k+1
. The headword of the newly
built constituent is inherited from either the
headword of the constituent W
k
or the next word
w
k+1
.

The probability of a parse tree T P (W,T ) of a

denotes the i th constructor action carried
out at position k in the word string.
The probability models of word-predictor, tag-
ger and constructor are initialized from the Upenn
Treebank with headword percolation and bina-
rization. The headwords are percolated using a
context-free approach based on rules of predict-
ing the position of the headword of the constituent.
The approach consists of three steps. First a parse
tree is decomposed to phrase constituents. Then
the headword position is identified and filled in
with the actual word percolated up from the leaves
of the tree recursively.
Instead of the UPenn Treebank-style, we use a
more convenient binary branching tree. The parse
trees are binarized using a rule-based approach.
The probability models of the word-predictor,
tagger and constructor are trained in a maximiza-
tion likelihood manner. The possible POS tag as-
signments, binary branching parse, non-terminal
labels and the head-word annotation for a given
sentence are hidden. We re-estimate them using
EM algorithm.
Instead of generating only the complete parse,
all parses for all the subsequences of the sen-
tence are produced. The headwords of the subtrees
are code switched to the embedded language with
a translation probability P
l
(v?
l
|w
l
) as well as the
leaves.
4.3 Decoding by Translation
Using either lattice parsing or partial parsing, a
two-pass decoding is needed to recognize code
switch speech. A computationally feasible first
pass generates an intermediate result so that the
language model with Functional Head constraint
can be used in the second pass. The first decoding
pass composes of the transducer of the universal
phoneme model P , the transducerC from context-
dependent phones to context-independent phones,
the lexicon transducer L which maps context-
independent phone sequences to word strings and
the transducer of the language model G. A T3 de-
coder is used in the first pass.
ASR

= P ? C ? L ?G (15)
Instead of N-best list, word lattice is used as the
intermediate output of the first decoding step.
The language model G
CS
of the transducer in
the second pass is improved from G by compos-
ing with the translation model P
l
(v?
l
|w
l
). Finally,
the recognition transducer is optimized by deter-
mination and minimization operations.

5 Experiments
5.1 Experimental Setup
The bilingual acoustic model used for our mixed
language ASR is trained from 160 hours of speech
from GALE Phase 1 Chinese broadcast conver-
sation, 40 hours of speech from GALE Phase 1
English broadcast conversation, and 3 hours of
in-house nonnative English data. The acoustic
features used in our experiments consist of 39
components (13MFCC, 13MFCC, 13MFCC us-
ing cepstral mean normalization), which are an-
alyzed at a 10msec frame rate with a 25msec win-
dow size. The acoustic models used throughout
our paper are state-clustered crossword tri-phone
HMMs with 16 Gaussian mixture output densi-
ties per state. We use the phone set consists of
21 Mandarin standard initials, 37 Mandarin finals,
6 zero initials and 6 extended English phones. The
pronunciation dictionary is obtained by modify-
ing Mandarin and English dictionaries using the
phone set. The acoustic models are reconstructed

by decision tree tying. We also collected two
speech databases with Chinese to English code
switching - namely, 20 hours of lecture speech cor-
pus (Data 1) and 3 hours of lunch conversation
corpus (Data 2). 18 hours of Data 1 is used for
acoustic model adaptation and 1 hour of data are
used as the test set (Test 1). 2 hours of Data 2 con-
taining 2389 utterances is used to adapt the acous-
tic model and 280 utterances are used as the test
set (Test 2). To train the parser, we use Chinese
Treebank Version 5.0 which consists of 500 thou-
sand words and use the standard data split (Petrov
and Klein, 2007).
For the language models, transcriptions of 18
hours of Data 1 are trained as a baseline mixed
language model for the lecture speech domain.
250,000 sentences from Chinese speech confer-
ence papers, power point slides and web data
are used for training a baseline Chinese matrix
language model for the lecture speech domain
(LM 1). Transcriptions of 2 hours of Data 2 are
used as the baseline mixed language model in the
lunch conversation domain. 250,000 sentences of
the GALE Phase 1 Chinese conversational speech
transcriptions are used to train a Chinese ma-
trix language model (LM 2). 250,000 of GALE
Phase 1 English conversational speech transcrip-
tion are used to train the English embedded lan-
guage model (LM 3). To train the bilingual trans-
lation model, the Chinese Gale Phase 1 conversa-
tional speech transcriptions are used to generate
a bilingual corpus using machine translation. For
comparison, an interpolated language model for
the lunch conversation domain is trained from in-
terpolating LM 2 with LM 3. Also for comparison,
an adapted language model for lecture speech is
trained from LM 1 and transcriptions of 18 hours
of Data 1. An adapted language mode l for conver-
sation is trained from LM 2 and 2 hours of Data 2.
The size of the vocabulary for recognition is 20k
words. The perplexity of the baseline language
model trained on the code switching speech tran-
scription is 236 on the lecture speech and 279 on
the conversation speech test sets.
5.2 Experimental Results
Table 1 reports precision, recall and F-measure
of code switching point in the recognition results
of the baseline and our proposed language mod-
els. Our proposed code switching language mod-
els with functional head constraint improve both
precision and recall of the code switching point
detection on the code switching lecture speech and
lunch conversation 4.48%. Our method by tight-
coupling increases the F-measure by 9.38% rela-
tively on the lecture speech and by 6.90% rela-
tively on the lunch conversation compared to the
baseline adapted language model.
The Table 2 shows the word error rates (WERs)
of experiments on the code switching lecture
speech and Table 3 shows the WERs on the code
switching lunch conversations. Our proposed code
switching language model with Functional Head
Constraints by sequential-coupling reduces the
WERs in the baseline mixed language model by
3.72% relative on Test 1, and 5.85% on Test 2. Our
method by tight-coupling also reduces WER by
2.51% relative compared to the baseline language
model on Test 1, and by 4.57% on Test 2. We
use the speech recognition scoring toolkit (SCTK)
developed by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology to compute the significance lev-
els, which is based on two-proportion z-test com-
paring the difference between the recognition re-
sults of our proposed approach and the baseline.
All the WER reductions are statistically signifi-
cant. For our reference, we also compare the per-
formance of using Functional Head Constraint to
that of using inversion constraint in (Li and Fung,
2012, 2013) and found that the present model re-
duces WER by 0.85% on Test 2 but gives no im-
provement on Test 1. We hypothesize that since

Test 1 has mostly Chinese words, the proposed
method is not as advantageous compared to our
previous work. Another future direction is for us
to improve the lattice parser as we believe it will
lead to further improvement on the final result of
our proposed method.
6 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose using lattice parsing and
partial parsing to incorporate a well-known syn-
tactic constraint for code mixing speech, namely
the Functional Head Constraint, into a continu-
ous speech recognition system. Under the Func-
tional Head Constraint, code switch cannot occur
between the functional head and its complements.
Since code mixing speech data is scarce, we pro-
pose to instead learn the code mixing language
model from bilingual data with this constraint.
The constrained code switching language model
is obtained by first expanding the search network
with a translation model, and then using parsing to
restrict paths to those permissible under the con-
straint. Lattice parsing enables a sequential cou-
pling of parsing then constraint filtering whereas
partial parsing enables a tight coupling between
parsing and filtering. A WFST-based decoder
then combines a bilingual acoustic model and the
proposed code-switch language model in an inte-
grated approach. Lattice-based parsing and partial
parsing are used to provide the syntactic structure
of the matrix language. Matrix words at the leave
nodes of the syntax tree are permitted to switch to
the embedded language if the switch does not vio-
late the Functional Head Constraint. This reduces
the permissible search paths from those expanded
by the bilingual language model. We tested our
system on a lecture speech dataset with 16% em-
bedded second language, and on a lunch conversa-
tion dataset with 20% embedded second language.
Our language models with lattice parsing and par-
tial parsing reduce word error rates from a baseline
mixed language model by 3.72% to 3.89% rela-
tive in the first task, and by 5.85% to 5.97% in
the second task. They are reduced from an inter-
polated language model by 3.69% to 3.74%, and
by 5.46% to 5.77% in the first and second task re-
spectively. WER reductions from an adapted lan-
guage model are 2.51% to 2.63%, and by 4.47%
to 4.74% in the two tasks. The F-measure for code
switch point detection is improved from 0.64 by
the interpolated model to 0.68, and from 0.67 by
the adapted model to 0.70 by our method. Our
proposed approach avoids making early decisions
on code-switch boundaries and is therefore more
robust. Our approach also avoids the bottleneck of
code switch data scarcity by using bilingual data
with syntactic structure. Moreover, our method re-
duces word error rates for both the matrix and the
embedded language.
