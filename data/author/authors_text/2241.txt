Abstract 
A method for mapping linguistic descrip-
tions in plain XML into semantically rich 
RDF/OWL is outlined and demonstrated. 
Starting with Simons?s (2003) original 
proof of concept of this method, we extend 
his Semantic Interpretation Language (SIL) 
for creating metaschemas to carry out the 
mapping, employ the General Ontology for 
Linguistic Description (GOLD) of Farrar 
and Langendoen (2003) as the target se-
mantic schema, and make use of SeRQL, 
an RDF-aware search engine. This data 
migration effort is in keeping with the vi-
sion of a Semantic Web; it is part of an ef-
fort to build a ?community of practice? 
around semantically rich linguistic re-
sources. 
1 Introduction 
Machine-readable structured linguistic docu-
ments (comparative word lists, lexicons, annotated 
texts, audio and audio-video recordings aligned 
with transcriptions (possibly annotated), gram-
matical descriptions, etc.) are being made available 
in a wide variety of formats on the Web. Until re-
cently, the linguistics community has not been par-
ticularly concerned about the ease with which 
those structures can be accessed by other users, nor 
about the comparability of the structures that can 
be accessed. Now that community is beginning to 
realize that XML encoding provides relatively 
straightforward access to the intended structures 
and at the same time insures that the documents 
will continue be accessible for the foreseeable fu-
ture.  
However, XML encoding by itself does not in-
sure comparability. To achieve that goal, the com-
munity must either adopt standards for encoding 
particular structures, or methods need to be devel-
oped for interpreting structures that are differently 
encoded. This paper reports on an effort to do the 
latter: to migrate XML documentation of linguistic 
structure to a semantically interoperable format. 
One of the most compelling reasons to do so is to 
enable intelligent search: the ability to query 
documents based on their semantics, rather than on 
strings of characters that may occur in them or on 
their document syntax. Facilitating intelligent 
searching is also one of the major goals of the Se-
mantic Web. We are making the first steps towards 
a Semantic Web for linguistics by showing how to 
migrate a significant amount of language resources 
to a format that makes them semantically compa-
rable. 
2 Background 
The work reported in this paper was carried out 
as part of the Electronic Metastructure for Endan-
gered Language Data (EMELD) project 
[emeld.org] (NSF grant 0094934) and the Data-
Driven Linguistic Ontology project (NSF grant 
0411348). One of the objectives of the EMELD 
project is the ?formulation and promulgation of 
best practice in linguistic markup of texts and lexi-
con.? Underlying this objective is the goal of en-
suring that the digital language documentation 
produced by linguists will be truly portable in the 
sense of Bird and Simons (2003): that it will tran-
scend computer environments, scholarly communi-
ties, domains of application, and the passage of 
time. The project was undertaken on the basis of 
the following principles: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
1. 
2. 
3. 
XML markup provides the best format for 
the interchange and archiving of endangered 
language description and documentation. 
No single schema or set of schemas for 
XML markup can be imposed on all lan-
guage resources. 
The resources must nevertheless be compa-
rable for searching, drawing inferences, etc.  
Simons (2003) points out the conflict between 
the second and third principles, and describes the 
following set of actions for reconciling them. 
Develop a community consensus on shared 
ontologies of linguistic concepts that can 
serve as the basis for interoperation. 
Define the semantics of any particular 
markup schema by mapping its elements and 
attributes to the concepts in the shared on-
tology that they represent. 
Map each individual language resource onto 
its (partial) semantic interpretation by apply-
ing the mapping of its markup schema. 
Perform queries and other knowledge-based 
operations across resources over these se-
mantic interpretations rather than the origi-
nal XML documents. 
The EMELD project has already begun work on 
the first of these action items, the creation of a 
sharable ontology for language documentation and 
description, a General Ontology for Linguistic De-
scription (GOLD) [emeld.org/gold] (Farrar and 
Langendoen, 2003), which is intended to be 
grounded in a suitable upper ontology such as 
SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001) or DOLCE (Ma-
solo et al, 2002). GOLD is itself being written in 
OWL, the Ontology Web Language (McGuinness 
and van Harmelen, 2004), for use in Semantic Web 
applications. Simons (2003, 2004) also provides a 
?proof of concept? for an implementation of the 
remaining three action items as follows. 
Beginning with three dictionaries that used 
similar but distinct markup based on the 
Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines 
(Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard, 2002), 
Simons created mappings from their differ-
ent markup schemas to a common semantics 
as defined by an RDF Schema (Brickley and 
Guha, 2004). Such a semantic schema pro-
vides a ?formal definition ... of the concepts 
in a particular domain, including types of re-
sources that exist, the properties that can re-
late pairs of resources, and the properties 
that can describe a single resource in terms 
of literal values? (Simons, 2004). This map-
ping he called a metaschema, a formal defi-
nition of how the elements and attributes of 
a markup schema are to be interpreted in 
terms of the concepts of the semantic 
schema. He called the ?language? for writing 
metaschemas (defined via an XML DTD) a 
Semantic Interpretation Language (SIL).  
Simons performed the semantic interpreta-
tion operation in a two-step process using 
XSLT, first to create an interpreter for a par-
ticular metaschema and then to apply it 
against a source document to yield the RDF 
document (repository) that is its semantic in-
terpretation. 
Simons then loaded the RDF repositories 
into a Prolog system to create a merged da-
tabase of RDF triples and used Prolog?s in-
ference engine to query the semantic inter-
pretations. 
Simons (2003) describes this implementation as 
providing a semantics of markup, rather than as 
devising yet another markup language for seman-
tics. As such, it is in the spirit of efforts such as 
Sperberg-McQueen et al (2000), who define the 
meaning of markup as the set of inferences li-
censed by it. However, their model does not pro-
vide for the general comparison of documents. It is 
also in the spirit of the proposal for a Linguistic 
Annotation Framework (LAF) under development 
by Working Group 1-1 of ISO TC 37 SC 4 
[www.tc37sc4.org] (Ide and Romary, 2003; Ide, 
Romary and de la Clergerie, 2003), but differs 
from it in some significant ways. For example, our 
strategy does not require that the source annota-
tions be mapped to an XML ?pivot format?. On the 
other hand, the LAF does not require that the 
source annotations be in XML to begin with. The 
?data categories? of the LAF correspond to the 
concepts in GOLD; however the ?creation of an 
ontology of annotation classes and types? is not yet 
part of the LAF (Ide, Romary and de la Clergerie 
2003). Moreover, the LAF data model is confined 
to feature structures, whereas GOLD plans to offer 
feature structures as one of several data structuring 
alternatives. Finally, through its connection with 
an upper ontology, GOLD will also be related to 
the ?rest of the world?, whereas the LAF ontology 
is apparently intended for linguistic structure only. 
3 Goals of this paper 
In this paper we extend Simons? proof of con-
cept for the use of metaschemas in the following 
ways. 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
GOLD itself is used as the semantic schema. 
SIL is extended to include the ability to map 
the content of designated elements and at-
tributes in source documents to the semantic 
schema, not just the markup itself. 
We devise metaschemas for lexicons that 
use distinct XML markup schemas: one of 
the lexicons that Simons (2003) originally 
used, for Sikaiana (Solomon Islands) with 
about 3000 entries; a Hopi (Arizona) dic-
tionary with about 30,000 entries, for which 
Kenneth Hill?s original encoding using a 
proprietary and no longer supported data-
base program was converted to XML by 
Lewis and Gonzalez; and a Potawatomi 
(Great Lakes region, US and Canada) lexi-
con being created by Laura Buszard-
Welcher using the EMELD FIELD tool. 
The Prolog query engine is replaced by 
SeRQL, an SQL-like query language for 
Sesame, an RDF database program (Broek-
stra, Kampman and van Harmelen 2002; 
User Guide for Sesame 2004). It is our in-
tention to couple Sesame with an inference 
engine that reads OWL documents, such as 
Racer (Haarslev and Moller 2001). 
In carrying out the migration of such language 
resources to the Semantic Web, we are guided by 
the principle of preserving the original analyses as 
much as possible. At the same time, since the mi-
grated resources are to be rendered mutually inter-
operable and transparent to the tools that are de-
signed to work over them, the migration process 
has the potential to greatly increase the precision 
of the original analyses, to reveal inconsistencies 
in them, and ultimately to result in enriched re-
sources. For example, the comparison of two de-
scriptions of the same language that has been made 
possible by migration could reveal errors in one or 
the other. Similarly, a single resource could be 
checked for consistency with accumulated linguis-
tic knowledge represented in an ontology. The mi-
gration process thus provides two sources of new 
knowledge. First is the knowledge brought in from 
the document interpretation process itself, i.e. by 
the linguist, not necessarily the one who performed 
the original analysis. Second when the migrated 
documents are added to the knowledge base, new 
inferences can be automatically generated based on 
the general knowledge of linguistics captured in 
the ontology. The type of new knowledge gener-
ated is however constrained, for example, by the 
type of search to be done over the resulting knowl-
edge base (see section 6). 
However the migration process can also skew or 
misinterpret the intentions underlying the original 
documentation. To minimize this risk, the migra-
tion tools should be as non-intrusive as possible. 
Even so, some steps are necessary to add structure 
where structure is lacking in the original XML 
documentation and to interpret the meaning of the 
original elements where their meanings are unde-
fined or unclear. For the ontology the implication 
is that theory-laden concepts either should be 
avoided or less encumbered alternatives should be 
made available.  
4 GOLD 
An important guiding principle used in the con-
struction of GOLD is to distinguish between those 
concepts that represent the content of linguistic 
data and those that pertain to the structuring of 
those data (cf. Ide and Romary 2003 who also dis-
tinguish between data content and data structure). 
A particular entry in a lexicon, for example, is a 
data structure used to organize lexical data in a 
particular fashion. Entries usually contain actual 
data instances, e.g., the Hopi word nahalayvi?yma 
or its phonological properties. The process of data 
migration is made much easier if a separation be-
tween data and data structure is upheld in the se-
mantic schema. 
4.1 Data content 
Linguistic data content includes linguistic ex-
pressions, the physical manifestations of language, 
also known as ?morphs?, or simply ?forms?, which 
may be written, spoken or signed. In GOLD, writ-
ten linguistic expressions are represented as 
ORTHOGRAPHICEXPRESSION with the subclasses 
ORTHOGRAPHICPART, ORTHOGRAPHICWORD, and 
ORTHOGRAPHICSENTENCE. These are defined as 
special types of strings. In order to analyze linguis-
tic data further, abstract counterparts of linguistic 
expressions are proposed called LINGUISTICUNIT. 
The abstract units are the main objects of interest 
in formal linguistics. In some theories, the various 
subclasses of LINGUISTICUNIT correspond to 
?morphemes?, ?constituents?, or ?constructions?. No 
assumptions are made about whether these have 
any mental significance, e.g. whether they are un-
derlying forms. The class hierarchy for 
LINGUISTICUNIT is presented in Farrar, Lewis and 
Langendoen (2002), and can be viewed in GOLD 
using Prot?g? 2.0 [protege.stanford.edu]. 
The LINGUISTICUNIT hierarchy is organized ac-
cording to how its components are realized as 
forms, and not according to their formal linguistic 
features, which are theory specific. So, for exam-
ple, LEXICALUNIT is simply a formal unit that can 
appear in isolation in its realized form, and not 
necessarily something that can be a constituent of 
larger syntactic constructions. The methodology 
leaves open the question of whether, for example, 
a SUBLEXICALUNIT can also be a phrasal constitu-
ent, as appears to be the case with CLITIC. Yet an-
other alternative would be to organize LINGUISTIC-
UNIT according to semantic features, e.g., a 
SUBLEXICALUNIT would be something which usu-
ally represents a grammaticized notion. But, since 
this varies from language to language, a different 
taxonomy would be needed for every type of lan-
guage encountered. To sum up, adhering to strictly 
formal features necessitates theory-specific tax-
onomies, while adhering to semantic features leads 
to language-specific taxonomies. Instead a neutral 
approach is taken in which LINGUISTICUNIT is or-
ganized according to how instances are realized as 
linguistic expressions. 
ORTHOGRAPHICEXPRESSION is related to LIN-
GUISTICUNIT by the predicate REALIZES. The par-
ticular sort of LINGUISTICUNIT is further defined 
according to what kinds of attributes it can take. 
So, a MORPHOSYNTACTICUNIT has attributes of 
the sort MORPHOSYNTACTICATTRIBUTE. Instances 
of particular attributes are PASTTENSE, SINGULAR-
NUMBER, and PROGRESSIVEASPECT. The class of 
attributes pertaining to linguistic units parallels 
other kinds of non-linguistic attributes such as 
SHAPEATTRIBUTE and PHYSICALSTATE. 
There are several varieties of attributes which 
linguists find useful for language description, in-
cluding phonological and semantic features. Se-
mantic attributes contrast with morphosyntactic 
attributes in that the former correspond to the no-
tional characteristics of linguistic form that have 
some manifestation in the grammar. 
4.2 Data structures 
A linguistic data structure is defined as an ab-
stract information container which provides a way 
to package elements of linguistic data. The two 
main types of data structures contained in GOLD 
at the moment are LEXICALITEM and FEATURE-
STRUCTURE. Our characterization of LEXICALITEM 
extends that of Bell and Bird (2000). At a mini-
mum, a LEXICALITEM should contain an instance 
of LEXICALUNIT or of SUBLEXICALUNIT. Special 
relations are given in GOLD which pertain only to 
data structures, e.g., HASLEXICALUNIT relates a 
LEXICALITEM to a LEXICALUNIT. Instances of 
LEXICALITEM typically include glosses either in 
the same language in the case of a monolingual 
lexicon, or in some other language in the case of a 
bilingual lexicon. Glosses are simply instances of 
ORTHOGRAPHICEXPRESSION related to the entry 
via the relation GLOSS. Entries relate to one an-
other via relations such as SYNONYMOF and 
ANTONYMOF. 
If a LEXICALITEM contains extensive morpho-
logical information, we may represent this in the 
form of a FEATURESTRUCTURE. The FEATURE-
STRUCTURE class is part of a more extensive set of 
data structures known as a FEATURESYSTEM (Lan-
gendoen and Simons, 1995; Maxwell, Simons and 
Hayashi, 2002). A FEATURESPECIFICATION is a 
data structure that contains a subclass and an in-
stance of MORPHOSYNTACTICATTRIBUTE (i.e. an 
ordered pair), for example, [TENSE: PASTTENSE]. 
The implementation of the FEATURESYSTEM con-
struct allows for recursive FEATURESPECIFICA-
TIONs in which, for example, a subclass of 
MORPHOSYNTACTICATTRIBUTE is paired with an 
instance of FEATURESTRUCTURE. 
One criticism that could be raised against the in-
clusion of data structures in a semantic resource 
such as GOLD is that they are superfluous. Why 
not simply leave it up to the source markup to de-
scribe the elements of data structure, e.g., in the 
form of an XML Schema? This is certainly a rea-
sonable criticism, since excluding data structures 
from GOLD would make the ontological model-
ling process much simpler. However, they are in-
cluded because we envision that subsequent appli-
cations will need to be able to reason, not only 
about the data itself, but also about how it is struc-
tured. For example, it might be necessary to com-
pare elements of a LEXICALITEM to that of 
FEATURESTRUCTURE. This is actually an essential 
step in achieving the vision of the Semantic Web, 
namely, constraining the source data in such a way 
as to preserve structure where structure is defined 
and to enrich structure where structure is left un-
specified. 
5 Semantic Interpretation Language 
The Semantic Interpretation Language (SIL) was 
originally created to define the meaning of the 
elements and attributes declared in an XML 
markup schema, as well as the relationships be-
tween them. An SIL metaschema is an XML 
document that formally maps the elements and 
attributes of an XML encoded resource to concepts 
in an OWL ontology or an RDF Schema. Further-
more, the metaschema formally interprets the 
original markup structure by declaring what the 
dominance and linking relations in the XML 
document structure represent. For example, con-
sider the extract from the Hopi lexicon shown in 
Figure 1. 
The dominance relation between the elements 
<MSI> (for ?morphosyntactic information?) and 
<POS> (for ?part of speech?) in the original XML 
is implicitly something like ?has?. This can be 
made more explicit by mapping it to HAS-
MORPHOSYNTACTICPROPERTY, a formally defined 
relation in the ontology. This relation is formally 
defined in the ontology by specifying its signature, 
i.e. what kinds of arguments it can take. Thus, a 
better defined, more exact, relationship between 
elements of markup is achieved. 
<Lexeme id="L3"> 
 <Headword>naheva</Headword> 
 <MSI> 
  <POS> 
<Feature name = "type">vt 
</Feature> 
  </POS> 
Figure 1. Extract from Hopi Lexicon 
SIL has been extended to formalize the resolu-
tion of content in addition to markup. For example, 
the semantics of the gram vt in the XML structure 
<POS>vt</POS> can be specified via a mapping 
to the ontology as an instance of VERB-
TRANSITIVE, in addition to defining the semantics 
of the POS element itself. 
An SIL metaschema, as described in detail in 
Simons (2004), is an XML document built from 
metaschema directives, which are essentially proc-
essing instructions expressed as XML elements. 
Directives like resource, property, lit-
eral and translate generate elements of the 
resulting semantic interpretation. Part of the SIL 
DTD is shown in Figure 2. 
<!ELEMENT metaschema (namespace+, 
(interpret | ignore)+)> 
<!ELEMENT namespace (#PCDATA)> 
<!ATTLIST namespace prefix CDATA 
#REQUIRED> 
<!ELEMENT interpret (resource | 
translate | property | 
literal)*> 
<!ATTLIST interpret markup CDATA 
#REQUIRED> 
<!ELEMENT resource (property | 
translate | literal | embed)*> 
<!ATTLIST resource concept CDATA 
#REQUIRED> 
<!ELEMENT property (resource | 
resourceRef | embed)> 
<!ATTLIST property concept CDATA 
#REQUIRED> 
<!ELEMENT translate EMPTY> 
<!ATTLIST translate concept CDATA 
#REQUIRED mapping CDATA 
#REQUIRED> 
Figure 2. SIL DTD fragment 
The interpret directive performs the pri-
mary mapping function from markup elements of 
the input resource to the enriched output, as dem-
onstrated in Figure 3. The tag <form> is inter-
preted as a LINGUISTICFORM, specifically as an 
ORTHOGRAPHICREPRESENTATION of that form. 
Input document: 
<form>ahali</form> 
Metaschema directive: 
<interpret markup="form"> 
<property concept = 
"gold:form"> 
<resource concept = 
"gold:LinguisticForm"> 
<literal concept = 
"gold:orthographicRepre
sentation"/> 
</resource> 
</property> 
</interpret> 
Interpretation (output): 
<gold:form> 
<gold:LinguisticForm> 
<gold:orthographicRepresen
tation>ahali 
</gold:orthographicRepresen
tation> 
</gold:LinguisticForm> 
</gold:form> 
Figure 3. Example interpretation of an element 
Of primary importance to the interpretation of 
content is the translate directive, as shown in 
Figure 4. In this example, the tag <Feature 
name="type">, embedded within <POS>, is 
interpreted as referencing a morphosyntactic prop-
erty, the value of which is content interpretable by 
the terminology set identified by the reference 
Hopi/Hopi_pos_mapping.xml. A terminol-
ogy set contains a simple mapping between terms 
used in the source document and the names of the 
equivalent concepts in the ontology. SIL can han-
dle both one-to-one terminology mappings (e.g., 
mapping from the tag vt to the concept VERB-
TRANSITIVE) as well as one-to-many mappings 
(e.g. mapping from 1sg to a property bundle of 
FIRSTPERSON and SINGULARNUMBER). 
Input document: 
<POS> 
<Feature name = "type">vt 
</Feature> 
</POS> 
Metaschema directive: 
<interpret markup = "POS/ 
Feature[@name='type']"> 
<translate concept = 
"gold:property" mapping = 
"Hopi/Hopi_pos_mapping.xml"/> 
</interpret> 
Interpretation (output): 
<gold:property rdf:resource = 
"emeld.org/gold#VerbTransitive"/> 
Figure 4. Example interpretation of content  
SIL is designed to allow interoperability be-
tween resources by mapping the different struc-
tures and content of markup in the source docu-
ments onto the same set of ontological concepts. 
This is demonstrated by comparing the trans-
formed output for Hopi shown in Figure 4 with the 
transformed output for Sikaiana in Figure 5. Note 
that the inputs are different but the outputs are the 
same. 
Input document: 
<pos>Verbt</pos> 
Metaschema directive: 
<interpret markup="pos"> 
<translate concept = 
"gold:property" mapping = 
"SKY/SKY_pos_mapping.xml"/> 
</interpret> 
Interpretation (output): 
<gold:property rdf:resource = 
"emeld.org/gold#VerbTransitive"/> 
Figure 5. Transformed Sikaiana <pos> 
The SIL only guarantees interoperability when 
comparable semantic resources are employed in 
the mapping. If an entire group relies on a common 
semantic schema, e.g. GOLD, a ?community of 
practice? is formed. This in turn facilitates intelli-
gent search across converted resources. 
Currently, writing an SIL metaschema is done 
entirely by hand. We are in the process, however, 
of developing two tools to automate the process. 
The first tool will allow the user to define the rela-
tionship between the terminology used within a 
resource with relevant GOLD concepts. The sec-
ond tool will define the structural mapping rela-
tionship between the resource and a given meta-
structure. The first tool, named Alchemy, presents 
the user with a drag-and-drop interface in which 
the user defines the terms used within her resource 
by associating them with one or more GOLD con-
cepts. The relationship between any given term 
and relevant GOLD concepts can be complex, with 
one-to-one or one-to-many relationships being al-
lowed, and the relationships themselves can be of 
any of a number of types: SameAs, KindOf, etc. 
We are in the process of building this tool, embed-
ded within an systems developer toolkit accompa-
nying GOLD. 
The second as of yet unnamed tool is still in the 
early design stages. This tool will allow the user to 
first define the type of resource she is converting 
(lexicon, interlinear text, grammar, etc.), and will 
then lead her through a series of questions that de-
fine the structure by associating it with a meta-type 
definition for the particular resource type. The tool 
will require a precise and well-defined ?semantics 
of linguistic structure?, a conceptual space of lin-
guistic structural types that will be included in 
GOLD, but is still in the process of being defined. 
The final output of this tool, in association with an 
Alchemy-defined terminology set, will be an SIL 
metaschema. 
6 Querying Resources 
In this section, we discuss the general issue of 
searching over linguistic descriptions on the Web, 
and the current state of our effort to do so using 
SeRQL (see section 3 item 4) over the RDF reposi-
tories for Sikaiana, Hopi and Potawatomi gener-
ated by the metaschemas from their XML-encoded 
lexicons. 
6.1 Dimensions of search over linguistic de-
scriptions 
As mentioned in section 1 above, one of the 
most compelling reasons to migrate XML docu-
mentation to a semantically interoperable format is 
to enable intelligent search. For the linguistics 
community, we envision several parameters of 
search over semantically interoperable linguistic 
documentation. Search may be performed accord-
ing to: 
? level of analysis (phonetic, morphosyntactic, 
discourse) 
? typological dimension (including language 
type) 
? intent of search (for exploring some particu-
lar language, or for language comparison) 
? kind of results desired (which data structure 
to return) 
Search also varies according to degree of diffi-
culty, that is, whether search requires the assis-
tance of an inferencing engine or not. Direct 
search is defined as search over explicitly repre-
sented data, i.e. instance data in the knowledge 
space. This includes the simple string matching of 
conventional search engines. But since the search 
will be carried out using the enriched RDF frame-
work, direct search is not limited to string match-
ing in the original XML. An example of direct 
search is to find all data that includes a reference to 
instances of some grammatical category (e.g., 
PASTTENSE). Boolean searching with direct search 
is also possible, e.g., searching for cases of port-
manteau morphemes, expressed in our framework 
as two or more MORPHOSYNTACTICATTRIBUTES 
associated with some LINGUISTICUNIT. 
Indirect search goes beyond direct search by 
making use of inferences based on the structuring 
of the concepts in an ontology. For example the 
concept of PLURALNUMBER means ?two or more?, 
the concept of DUALNUMBER means ?exactly two?, 
and the concept of MULTALNUMBER means ?three 
or more?. A direct search for PLURALNUMBER will 
miss those instances represented as DUALNUMBER 
and MULTALNUMBER, whereas an indirect search 
will find them. 
6.2 Some SeRQL queries 
In Figure 6, we give the SeRQL query (omitting 
using namespace) for the orthographic forms 
for all the lexical items specified as having the 
GOLD concept PROGRESSIVEASPECT in the three 
lexicons. This query returned 1135 results, all from 
Hopi.  
select distinct R 
from {LI} <gold:meaning> {} 
<gold:grammar> {} 
<gold:property> 
{<gold:ProgressiveAspect>}, 
{LI} <gold:form> {} 
<gold:orthographicRepresenta
tion> {R} 
Figure 6. SeRQL query for 
PROGRESSIVEASPECT forms 
Next, the query in Figure 7 returns all the gram-
matical properties of lexical items categorized as 
NOUNs in each of the lexicons. There were 21 re-
sults from Hopi, 3 from Sikaiana and 6 from 
Potawatomi; an example for each language is 
given in Figure 8. The fact that certain items 
categorized as NOUNs in Sikaiana are also 
categorized as VERBs indicates that those items 
have both classifications. In Figure 9, we give the 
SeRQL query for all such items; 61 results were 
obtained. 
select distinct P, LC 
from {LI} <gold:meaning> {} 
<gold:grammar> {MSI} 
<gold:property> 
{<gold:Noun>}; 
<gold:property> {P}, 
{LI} <gold:languageCode> {LC} 
where P != <gold:Noun> 
Figure 7. SeRQL query for attributes of NOUNs 
Hopi: AUGMENTATIVE 
Sikaiana: VERB 
Potawatomi: INANIMATE 
Figure 8. Sample results of query in Figure 7 
select distinct LI 
from {LI} <gold:meaning> {} 
<gold:grammar> {} 
<gold:property> {<gold:Noun>}; 
<gold:property> {<gold:Verb>} 
Figure 9. SeRQL query for all lexical items 
marked as both NOUN and VERB 
Finally in Figure 10, we give a query used to 
find the parts of speech that are common to entries 
in the Hopi and Sikaiana lexicons. Four results 
were returned, NOUN, VERB, ADJECTIVE and 
NUMERAL. 
select distinct P 
from {LI} <gold:meaning> {} 
<gold:grammar> {} 
<gold:property> {P},  
{LI2} <gold:meaning> {} 
<gold:grammar> {} 
<gold:property> {P},  
{LI} <gold:languageCode> {LC}, 
{LI2} <gold:languageCode> 
{LC2} 
where LC = "HOP" AND LC2 = "SKY" 
Figure 10. SeRQL query for common parts of 
speech in two lexicons 
More complex queries that take advantage of the 
structure of the ontology are also possible, for ex-
ample to find all the verbs in the lexicons regard-
less of whether they have been tagged as transitive 
verbs, intransitive verbs, or simply as verbs. With 
further development of the method described here, 
much more elaborate queries over much larger lin-
guistic data repositories will be possible. This re-
sult, we hope, will encourage much more wide-
spread distribution of language resources on the 
Web and the creation of a large community of 
practice that uses those resources for research, 
teaching, and language revitalization efforts.
