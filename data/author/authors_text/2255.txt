Abstract 
We present a new approach to paratactic 
content aggregation in the context of 
generating hypertext summaries of OLAP 
and data mining discoveries. Two key 
properties make this approach innovative 
and interesting: (1) it encapsulates 
aggregation inside the sentence planning 
component, and (2) it relies on a domain 
independent algorithm working on a data 
structure that abstracts from lexical and 
syntactic knowledge. 
1 Research context: hypertext 
executive summary generation for 
intelligent decision-support 
In this paper, we present a new approach to 
content aggregation in Natural Nanguage 
Generation (NLG). This approach has been 
developed for the NLG system HYSSOP 
(HYpertext Summary System of On-line 
analytical Processing) which summarizes OLAP 
(On-Line Analytical Processing) and Data 
Mining discoveries into an hypevtext report. 
HYSSOP is itself part of the Intelligent 
Decision-Support System (IDSS) MATRIKS 
(Multidimensional Ana lys i s  and Textual 
Reporting for Insight Knowledge Search), which 
aims to provide a comprehensive knowledge 
discovery environment through seamless 
integration of data warehousing, OLAP, data 
mining, expert system and NLG technologies. 
1.1 The MATRIKS intelligent decision- 
support system 
The architecture of MATRIKS is given in Fig. 
1. It extends previous cutting-edge environments 
for Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) 
such as DBMiner (Han et al 1997) by the 
integration of: 
? a data warehouse hypercube exploration 
expert system allowing automation and 
expertise legacy of dimensional data 
warehouse xploration strategies developed 
by human data analyst using OLAP queries 
and data mining tools; 
? an hypertext executive summary generator 
reporting data hypercube exploration insights 
in the most concise and familiar way: a few 
web pages of natural language. 
These two extensions allow an IDSS to be used 
directly by decision makers without constant 
mediation of a data analyst. 
1.2 The HYSSOP natural language 
hypertext summary generator 
To our knowledge, the development of 
HYSSOP is pioneer work in coupling OLAP 
and data mining with natural language 
generation, Fig. 2. We view such coupling as a 
synergetic fit with tremendous potential for a 
wide range of practical applications. In a 
nutshell', while NLG is the only technology able 
to completely fulfill the reporting needs of 
i See Favero (2000) for further justification for this 
view, as well as for details on the motivation and 
technology underlying MATRIKS. 
124 
OLAP and data mining, these two technologies 
are reciprocally the only ones able to completely 
fulfill the content determination needs of a key 
NLG application sub-class: textual 
summarization ofquantitative data.

Generators that summarize large amount of 
quantitative data by a short natural anguage text 
(such as ANA (Kukich 1988), GOSSIP 
(Carcagno and Iordanskaja 1993), PLANDoc 
(McKeown, Kukich and Shaw 1994) among 
others) generally perform content determination 
by relying on a fixed set of domain-dependent 
heuristic rules. Such an approach suffers from 
two severe limitations that prevent it from 
reporting the most interesting content from an 
underlying database: 
o it does not scale up for analytical contexts 
with high dimensionality and which take into 
account the .hi-smrical.:.e~olution .,of data 
through time; such complex context would 
require a combinatorially explosive number 
of summary content determination heuristic 
rules; 
o it can only select facts whose class have been 
thought ahead by the rule base author, while 
in most cases, it is its very unexpectedness 
that makes a fact interesting to report;

Fig. 2 - The architecture of HYSSOP 
CLAP and data mining are the two technologies 
that emerged to tackle precisely these two 
issues: for OLAP, efficient search in a high 
dimensionality, historical data search space, and 
for data mining, automatic discovery in such 
spaces, of hitherto unsuspected regularities or 
singularities. In the MATRIKS architecture, 
heuristic rules are not used to define content 
worth reporting in a data warehouse xecutive 
summary. Instead, they are used to guide the 
process of searching the warehouse for 
unexpected facts using OLAP and data mining 
operators. 
A data warehouse hypercube xploration expert 
system encapsulates such rules in its knowledge 
base to perform content determination. An 
example outPUt of such expert system, and input 
tO HYSSOP, is ,given in Fig. 3:. the data cells 
selected for inclusion in the output textual 
summary are passed along with their CLAP 
context and the data mining annotations that 
justify their relevance. One output generated by 
HYSSOP from this input is given in Fig. 4. and 
Fig. 5.

(Sarawagi, Agrawal and Megiddo, 1998). The part inside the bold sub-frame is the input to the 
sentence planner 
Last year, the most atypical sales variations from one month to the next occurred for: 
? Birch Beer with a 42% national increase from September to October; 
? Diet Soda with a 40% decrease in the Eastern region from July to August. 
At the next level of idiosyncrasy came: 
? Cola "s Colorado sales, falling 40% from July to August and then a further 32% from September to October; 
? again Diet Soda Eastern sales, falling 33% from September to October. 
Less aberrant but still notably atypical were: 
? again nationwide Birch Beer sales'-12% from June to July and -10% from November to December; 
? Cola's 11% fall from July to August in the Central region and 30% dive in Wisconsin from August to 
September; 
? Diet Soda sales" 19% increase in the Southern region from July to August, followed by its two opposite 
regional variations from August to September, +10% in the East but -17% in the West; 
. national Jolt Cola sales' +6._% from August to September. 
To know what makes one of these variations unusual in the context of this year's sales, click on it. 
Fig. 4 - Example of HYSSOP front-page output 
The 40% decrease in Diet Soda sales was very atypical mostly due to the combination of the two following facts. 
? across the rest of the regions, the July to August average variation for that product was 9% increase, 
o over the rest of the year, the average monthly decrease in Eastern sales for that product was only 7%." 
o across the rest of the product line, the Eastern sales variations from July to August was 2%

The architecture of HYSSOP is given in Fig. 2. Robin 1997), while surface syntactic realization 
HYSSOP is entirely implemented in LIFE (Ait- follows the approach described in (Favero and 
Kaci and Lincoln. 198.9), a languagethat .extends.. ..... Robin.,2000b),:- H?-SSOP~-makes -two innovative 
Prolog with functional programming, arityless 
feature structure unification and hierarchical 
type constraint inheritance. For content 
realization, HYSSOP relies on feature structure 
unification. Lexicalization is inspired from the 
approach described in (Elhadad, McKeown and 
contributions to NLG research: one to hypertext 
content planning presented in (Favero and 
Robin 2000a) and one to content aggregation 
presented in the rest of this paper. 
2 Research focus: content  aggregat ion  
126 
in natural language generation 
Natural language generation system is 
traditionally decomposed in the following 
subtasks: content determination, discourse-level 
content organization, sentence-level content 
organization, lexical content realization and 
grammatical content realization. The first three 
......................... subtasks together ate_often=referred toas.Jzontent 
planning, and the last two together as linguistic 
realization. This separation is now fairly 
standard and most implementations encapsulate 
each task in a separate module (Robin 1995), 
(Reiter 1994). 
Another generation subtask that has recently 
received much attention is content aggregation. 
However, there is still no consensus on the exact 
scope of aggregation and on its precise relation 
with the five standard generation tasks listed 
above. To avoid ambiguity, we define 
aggregation here as: grouping several content 
units, sharing various semantic features, inside 
a single linguistic structure, in such a way that 
the shared features are maximally factored out 
and minimally repeated in the generated text. 
Defined as above, aggregation is essentially a
key subtask of sentence planning. As such, 
aggregation choices are constrained by 
discourse planning decisions and they in turn 
constrain lexical choices. 
In HYSSOP, aggregation is carried out by the 
sentence planner in three steps: 
1. content factorization, which is performed on 
a tabular data structure called a Factorization 
Matrix (FM) ; 
2. generation from the FM of a discourse tree 
representing the hypertext plan to pass down 
to the lexicalizer; 
3. top-down traversal of the discourse tree to 
detect content units with shared features 
occurring in non-adjacent sentences and 
2.1 Content faetorization i,iHYSSOP 
The key properties of the factorization matrix 
that sets it apart from previously proposed ata 
structures on which to perform aggregation are 
that: 
? it fully abstracts from lexical and syntactic 
information; 
q. ~...it. focuses, on, two =types,:ofAnformation. kept
separate in most generators, (1) the semantic 
features of each sentence constituent 
(generally represented only before 
lexicalization), and (2) the linear precedence 
constraints between them (generally 
represented only late during syntactic 
realization); 
? it visually captures the interaction between 
the two, which underlies the factorization 
phenomenon at the core of aggregation. 
In HYSSOP, the sentence planner eceives as 
input from the discourse planner an FM 
representing the yet unaggregated content to be 
conveyed, together with an ordered list of 
candidate semantic dimensions to consider for 
outermost factoring. The pseudo-code of 
HYSSOP's aggregation algorithm is given in 
Fig. 10. We now illustrate this algorithm on the 
input example FM that appears inside the bold 
sub-frame of the overall HYSSOP input given in 
Fig. 3. For this example, we assume that the 
discourse planner directive is to factor out first 
the exception dimension, followed by the 
product dimension, i.e., FactoringStrategy = 
\[except,product\]. This example illustrates the 
mixed initiative choice of the aggregation 
strategy: part of it is dictated by the discourse 
planner to ensure that aggregation will not 
adversely affect the high-level textual 
organization that it carefully planned. 
The remaining part, in our example factoring 
along the place and time dimensions, is left to 
annotate them as anaphora. 
Such annotations are then used by the 
lexicalizer to choose the appropriate cue word to 
insert near or in place of the anaphoric item. 
- : : - : .  : the:initiative.~f'~the:-sentence pla n r. The. first 
step of HYSSOP's aggregation algorithm is to 
shift the priority dimension D of the factoring 
strategy to the second leftmost column of the 
FM. The second step is to sort the FM rows in 
(increasing or decreasing) order of their D cell 
values. The third step is to horizontally slice the 
127 
? FM into row groups withidentical D cellvalues. 
The fourth step is to merge these identical cells 
and annotate the merged cell with the number of 
cells that it replaced. The FM resulting from 
these four first steps on the input FM inside the 
bold sub-frame of Fig. 3 using exception as 
factoring dimension is given in Fig. 6. 
? The fifth step consists,.,oPreetlrsi~vely'eaHingthe 
entire aggregation algorithm inside each row 
group on the sub-FM to the right of D, using the 
remaining dimensions of the factoring strategy. 
Let us now follow one such recursive call: the 
one on the sub-FM inside a bold sub-frame in 
Fig. 6 to the right of the exception column in the 
third row group. The result of the first four 
aggregation steps of this recursive call is given 
in Fig. 7. This time it is the product dimension 
that has been left-shifted and that provided the 
basis for row sorting, row grouping and cell 
merging. Further recursive calls are now 
triggered. These calls are different from the 
preceding ones, however, in that at this point all 
the input constraints provided by the discourse 
planner have already been satisfied. It is thus 
now up to the sentence planner to choose along 
which dimension to perform the next 
factorization step. In the current 
implementation, the column with the lowest 
number of distinct values is always chosen. In 
our example, this translates as factoring along 
the time dimension for some row groups and 
along the space dimension for the others. The 
result of the recursive aggregation call on the 
sub-FM inside the bold frame of Fig. 7 is given 
in Fig. 8. In this case, factoring occurred along 
the time dimension. The fully aggregated FM 
resulting from all the recursive calls is given in 
Fig. 9. Note how the left to right embedding of 
its cells reflects exactly the left to right 
embedding of the phrases in the natural 
language summary of Fig. 4 generated from it. 
2.2 Cue word generation in HYSSOP 
Once content factorization is completed, the 
sentence planner builds in two passes the 
discourse tree that the lexicalizer expects as 
input. In the first pass. the sentence planner 
patterns the recursive structure of the tree (that 
itself-prefigures the output-text linguistic 
constituent structure) after the left to right and 
narrowing embedding of  sub-matrices inside the 
FM.

3 Related work in content aggregation 
The main previous works on content 
aggregation are due to: 
o (Dalianis 1995, 1996), whose ASTROGEN 
system generates natural language 
paraphrases of formal software specification 
for validation purposes; 
(Huang and Fiedler 1997), whose PROVERB 
system generates natural language 
mathematical proofs from a theorem prover 
reasoning trace; 
(Robin and McKeown, 1996), whose 
STREAK system generates basketball game 
summaries from a semantic network 
130 
representing the key game statistics and their 
historical context; 
(Shaw 1998), whose CASPER discourse and 
sentence planner has been used both in the 
PLANDoc system that generates 
telecommunication equipment installation 
plan documentation from an expert system 
trace and the MAGIC system that generates 
extracted from a dimensional data warehouse 
hypercube. In contrast, he other systems all take 
as input either a semantic network extracted 
from a knowledge base or a pre-linguistic 
representation f the text to generate such as 
Meteer's text structure (Meteer 1992) or 
Jackendoffs semantic structure (Jackendoff 
1985). Such natural language processing 
ICU 
measurements. 
In this section, we briefly compare these 
research efforts with ours along four 
dimensions: (1) the definition of aggregation 
and the scope of the aggregation task 
implemented in the generator, (2) the type of 
representation the generator takes as input and 
the type of output ext that it produces, (3) the 
generator's architecture and the localization of 
the aggregation task within it, and (4) the data 
structures and algorithms used to implement 
aggregation. 
3.1 Definition of the aggregation task 
The definition of aggregation that we gave at the 
beginning of previous ection is similar to those 
provided by Dalianis and Huang, although it 
focuses on common feature factor izat ion to 
insure aggregation remains a proper  subset of 
sentence planning. By viewing aggregation only 
as a process of combining clauses, Shaw's 
definition is more restrictive. In our view, 
aggregation is best handled prior to commit o 
specific syntactic categories and the same 
abstract process, such the algorithm of Fig. 10, 
can be used to aggregate content units inside 
linguistic constituents of any syntactic ategory 
(clause, nominal, prepositional phrases, 
adjectival phrases, etc.). In terms of aggregation 
task coverage, HYSSOP focuses on paratactic 
forms of  aggregation. In contrast, ASTROGEN, 
PROVERB and STREAK also

perform 
aggregation.

representation and generated 
A second characteristic that sets HYSSOP apart 
from other generators perfornfing aggregation is 
the nature of its input: a set of data cells 
generation task and hide important issues that 
come up in real life applications for which raw 
data is often the only available input. In terms of 
output, HYSSOP differs from most other 
systems in that it generates hypertext instead of 
linear text. It thus tackles the content 
aggregation problem in a particularly demanding 
application requiring the generator to 
simultaneously start from raw data, produce 
hypertext output and enforce conciseness 
constraints. 
3.3 Generation architecture and 
aggregation localization 
While its overall architecture is a conventional 
pipeline, HYSSOP is unique in encapsulating all
aggregation processing in the sentence planner 
and carrying it out entirely on a deep semantic 
representation. I  contrast, most other systems 
distribute aggregation over several processing 
components and across several levels of internal 
representations: deep semantic, thematic and 
even surface syntactic for some of them. 
3.4 Data structures and algorithms for 
aggregation 
All previous approaches to aggregations relied 
on rules that included some domain-specific 
semantic or lexical information. In contrast, the 
aggregation algorithm used by HYSSOP is 
domain independent since it relies only on (1) 
generic matrix row and column shuffling 
operations, and (2) on a generic similarity

4 Conclusion 
We presented a new approach to content 
aggregation i the context of a very challenging 
and practical generation application: 
summarizing OLAP and data mining discoveries

as a few linked web pages of  fluent and concise 
natural language. We believe that the key 
contribution to our work is to show the 
feasibility to perform effective paratactic 
aggregation:

component ( he sentence planner)

This is a first success towards the development 
of a plug-in content aggregation component for 
text generation, reusable across application 
domains. In future work, we intend to 
empirically evaluate the summaries generated by 
HYSSOP.
