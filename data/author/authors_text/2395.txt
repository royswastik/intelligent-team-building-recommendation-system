Abstract
This paper evaluates the translation quality
of machine translation systems for 8 lan-
guage pairs: translating French, German,
Spanish, and Czech to English and back.
We carried out an extensive human evalua-
tion which allowed us not only to rank the
different MT systems, but also to perform
higher-level analysis of the evaluation pro-
cess. We measured timing and intra- and
inter-annotator agreement for three types of
subjective evaluation. We measured the cor-
relation of automatic evaluation metrics with
human judgments. This meta-evaluation re-
veals surprising facts about the most com-
monly used methodologies.
1 Introduction
This paper presents the results for the shared trans-
lation task of the 2007 ACL Workshop on Statistical
Machine Translation. The goals of this paper are
twofold: First, we evaluate the shared task entries
in order to determine which systems produce trans-
lations with the highest quality. Second, we analyze
the evaluation measures themselves in order to try to
determine ?best practices? when evaluating machine
translation research.
Previous ACL Workshops on Machine Transla-
tion were more limited in scope (Koehn and Monz,
2005; Koehn and Monz, 2006). The 2005 workshop
evaluated translation quality only in terms of Bleu
score. The 2006 workshop additionally included a
limited manual evaluation in the style of NIST ma-
chine translation evaluation workshop. Here we ap-
ply eleven different automatic evaluation metrics,
and conduct three different types of manual evalu-
ation.
Beyond examining the quality of translations pro-
duced by various systems, we were interested in ex-
amining the following questions about evaluation
methodologies: How consistent are people when
they judge translation quality? To what extent do
they agree with other annotators? Can we im-
prove human evaluation? Which automatic evalu-
ation metrics correlate most strongly with human
judgments of translation quality?
This paper is organized as follows:
? Section 2 gives an overview of the shared task.
It describes the training and test data, reviews
the baseline system, and lists the groups that
participated in the task.
? Section 3 describes the manual evaluation. We
performed three types of evaluation: scoring
with five point scales, relative ranking of trans-
lations of sentences, and ranking of translations
of phrases.
? Section 4 lists the eleven different automatic
evaluation metrics which were also used to
score the shared task submissions.
? Section 5 presents the results of the shared task,
giving scores for each of the systems in each of
the different conditions.
? Section 6 provides an evaluation of the dif-
ferent types of evaluation, giving intra- and
136
inter-annotator agreement figures for the man-
ual evaluation, and correlation numbers for the
automatic metrics.
2 Shared task overview
This year?s shared task changed in some aspects
from last year?s:
? We gave preference to the manual evaluation of
system output in the ranking of systems. Man-
ual evaluation was done by the volunteers from
participating groups and others. Additionally,
there were three modalities of manual evalua-
tion.
? Automatic metrics were also used to rank the
systems. In total eleven metrics were applied,
and their correlation with the manual scores
was measured.
? As in 2006, translation was from English, and
into English. English was again paired with
German, French, and Spanish. We additionally
included Czech (which was fitting given the lo-
cation of the WS).
Similar to the IWSLT International Workshop on
Spoken Language Translation (Eck and Hori, 2005;
Paul, 2006), and the NIST Machine Translation
Evaluation Workshop (Lee, 2006) we provide the
shared task participants with a common set of train-
ing and test data for all language pairs. The major
part of data comes from current and upcoming full
releases of the Europarl data set (Koehn, 2005).
2.1 Description of the Data
The data used in this year?s shared task was similar
to the data used in last year?s shared task. This year?s
data included training and development sets for the
News Commentary data, which was the surprise out-
of-domain test set last year.
The majority of the training data for the Spanish,
French, and German tasks was drawn from a new
version of the Europarl multilingual corpus. Addi-
tional training data was taken from the News Com-
mentary corpus. Czech language resources were
drawn from the News Commentary data. Additional
resources for Czech came from the CzEng Paral-
lel Corpus (Bojar and Z?abokrtsky?, 2006). Overall,
there are over 30 million words of training data per
language from the Europarl corpus and 1 million
words from the News Commentary corpus. Figure 1
provides some statistics about the corpora used this
year.
2.2 Baseline system
To lower the barrier of entrance to the competition,
we provided a complete baseline MT system, along
with data resources. To summarize, we provided:
? sentence-aligned training corpora
? development and dev-test sets
? language models trained for each language
? an open source decoder for phrase-based SMT
called Moses (Koehn et al, 2006), which re-
places the Pharaoh decoder (Koehn, 2004)
? a training script to build models for Moses
The performance of this baseline system is similar
to the best submissions in last year?s shared task.
2.3 Test Data
The test data was again drawn from a segment of
the Europarl corpus from the fourth quarter of 2000,
which is excluded from the training data. Partici-
pants were also provided with three sets of parallel
text to be used for system development and tuning.
In addition to the Europarl test set, we also col-
lected editorials from the Project Syndicate web-
site1, which are published in all the five languages
of the shared task. We aligned the texts at a sentence
level across all five languages, resulting in 2,007
sentences per language. For statistics on this test set,
refer to Figure 1.
The News Commentary test set differs from the
Europarl data in various ways. The text type are ed-
itorials instead of speech transcripts. The domain is
general politics, economics and science. However, it
is also mostly political content (even if not focused
on the internal workings of the European Union) and
opinion.
2.4 Participants

increase over last year?s shared task where submis-
sions were received from 14 groups from 11 insti-
tutions. Of the 11 groups that participated in last
year?s shared task, 6 groups returned this year.
This year, most of these groups follow a phrase-
based statistical approach to machine translation.
However, several groups submitted results from sys-
tems that followed a hybrid approach.
While building a machine translation system is a
serious undertaking we hope to attract more new-
comers to the field by keeping the barrier of entry
as low as possible. The creation of parallel corpora
such as the Europarl, the CzEng, and the News Com-
mentary corpora should help in this direction by pro-
viding freely available language resources for build-
ing systems. The creation of an open source baseline
system should also go a long way towards achieving
this goal.
For more on the participating systems, please re-
fer to the respective system description in the pro-
ceedings of the workshop.
3 Human evaluation
We evaluated the shared task submissions using both
manual evaluation and automatic metrics. While
automatic measures are an invaluable tool for the
day-to-day development of machine translation sys-
tems, they are an imperfect substitute for human
assessment of translation quality. Manual evalua-
tion is time consuming and expensive to perform,
so comprehensive comparisons of multiple systems
are rare. For our manual evaluation we distributed
the workload across a number of people, including
participants in the shared task, interested volunteers,
and a small number of paid annotators. More than
100 people participated in the manual evaluation,
with 75 of those people putting in at least an hour?s
worth of effort. A total of 330 hours of labor was in-
vested, nearly doubling last year?s all-volunteer ef-
fort which yielded 180 hours of effort.
Beyond simply ranking the shared task submis-
sions, we had a number of scientific goals for the
manual evaluation. Firstly, we wanted to collect
data which could be used to assess how well au-
tomatic metrics correlate with human judgments.
Secondly, we wanted to examine different types of
manual evaluation and assess which was the best.
A number of criteria could be adopted for choos-
ing among different types of manual evaluation: the
ease with which people are able to perform the task,
their agreement with other annotators, their reliabil-
ity when asked to repeat judgments, or the number
of judgments which can be collected in a fixed time
period.
There are a range of possibilities for how human
139
evaluation of machine translation can be done. For
instance, it can be evaluated with reading compre-
hension tests (Jones et al, 2005), or by assigning
subjective scores to the translations of individual
sentences (LDC, 2005). We examined three differ-
ent ways of manually evaluating machine translation
quality:
? Assigning scores based on five point adequacy
and fluency scales
? Ranking translated sentences relative to each
other
? Ranking the translations of syntactic con-
stituents drawn from the source sentence
3.1 Fluency and adequacy
The most widely used methodology when manually
evaluatingMT is to assign values from two five point
scales representing fluency and adequacy. These
scales were developed for the annual NIST Machine
Translation Evaluation Workshop by the Linguistics
Data Consortium (LDC, 2005).
The five point scale for adequacy indicates how
much of the meaning expressed in the reference
translation is also expressed in a hypothesis trans-
lation:
5 = All
4 = Most
3 = Much
2 = Little
1 = None
The second five point scale indicates how fluent
the translation is. When translating into English the
values correspond to:
5 = Flawless English
4 = Good English
3 = Non-native English
2 = Disfluent English
1 = Incomprehensible
Separate scales for fluency and adequacy were
developed under the assumption that a translation
might be disfluent but contain all the information
from the source. However, in principle it seems that
people have a hard time separating these two as-
pects of translation. The high correlation between
people?s fluency and adequacy scores (given in Ta-
bles 17 and 18) indicate that the distinction might be
false.

Figure 2: In constituent-based evaluation, the source
sentence was parsed, and automatically aligned with
the reference translation and systems? translations
Another problem with the scores is that there are
no clear guidelines on how to assign values to trans-
lations. No instructions are given to evaluators in
terms of how to quantify meaning, or how many
grammatical errors (or what sort) separates the dif-
ferent levels of fluency. Because of this many judges
either develop their own rules of thumb, or use the
scales as relative rather than absolute. These are
borne out in our analysis of inter-annotator agree-
ment in Section 6.
3.2 Ranking translations of sentences
Because fluency and adequacy were seemingly diffi-
cult things for judges to agree on, and because many
people from last year?s workshop seemed to be using
them as a way of ranking translations, we decided to
try a separate evaluation where people were simply
140
asked to rank translations. The instructions for this
task were:
Rank each whole sentence translation
from Best to Worst relative to the other
choices (ties are allowed).
These instructions were just as minimal as for flu-
ency and adequacy, but the task was considerably
simplified. Rather than having to assign each trans-
lation a value along an arbitrary scale, people simply
had to compare different translations of a single sen-
tence and rank them.
3.3 Ranking translations of syntactic
constituents
In addition to having judges rank the translations
of whole sentences, we also conducted a pilot
study of a new type of evaluation methodology,
which we call constituent-based evaluation. In our
constituent-based evaluation we parsed the source
language sentence, selected constituents from the
tree, and had people judge the translations of those
syntactic phrases. In order to draw judges? attention
to these regions, we highlighted the selected source
phrases and the corresponding phrases in the transla-
tions. The corresponding phrases in the translations
were located via automatic word alignments.
Figure 2 illustrates the constituent based evalu-
ation when applied to a German source sentence.
The German source sentence is parsed, and vari-
ous phrases are selected for evaluation. Word align-
ments are created between the source sentence and
the reference translation (shown), and the source
sentence and each of the system translations (not
shown). We parsed the test sentences for each of
the languages aside from Czech. We used Cowan
and Collins (2005)?s parser for Spanish, Arun and
Keller (2005)?s for French, Dubey (2005)?s for Ger-
man, and Bikel (2002)?s for English.
The word alignments were created with Giza++
(Och and Ney, 2003) applied to a parallel corpus
containing 200,000 sentence pairs of the training
data, plus sets of 4,007 sentence pairs created by
pairing the test sentences with the reference transla-
tions, and the test sentences paired with each of the
system translations. The phrases in the translations
were located using techniques from phrase-based
statistical machine translation which extract phrase
pairs fromword alignments (Koehn et al, 2003; Och
and Ney, 2004). Because the word-alignments were
created automatically, and because the phrase ex-
traction is heuristic, the phrases that were selected
may not exactly correspond to the translations of the
selected source phrase. We noted this in the instruc-
tions to judges:
Rank each constituent translation from
Best to Worst relative to the other choices
(ties are allowed). Grade only the high-
lighted part of each translation.
Please note that segments are selected au-
tomatically, and they should be taken as
an approximate guide. They might in-
clude extra words that are not in the actual
alignment, or miss words on either end.
The criteria that we used to select which con-
stituents were to be evaluated were:
? The constituent could not be the whole source
sentence
? The constituent had to be longer three words,
and be no longer than 15 words
? The constituent had to have a corresponding
phrase with a consistent word alignment in
each of the translations
The final criterion helped reduce the number of
alignment errors.
3.4 Collecting judgments
We collected judgments using a web-based tool.
Shared task participants were each asked to judge
200 sets of sentences. The sets consisted of 5 sys-
tem outputs, as shown in Figure 3. The judges
were presented with batches of each type of eval-
uation. We presented them with five screens of ade-
quacy/fluency scores, five screens of sentence rank-
ings, and ten screens of constituent rankings. The
order of the types of evaluation were randomized.
In order to measure intra-annotator agreement
10% of the items were repeated and evaluated twice
by each judge. In order to measure inter-annotator
agreement 40% of the items were randomly drawn
from a common pool that was shared across all

annotators so that we would have items that were
judged by multiple annotators.
Judges were allowed to select whichever data set
they wanted, and to evaluate translations into what-
ever languages they were proficient in. Shared task
participants were excluded from judging their own
systems.
Table 2 gives a summary of the number of judg-
ments that we collected for translations of individ-
ual sentences. Since we had 14 translation tasks and
four different types of scores, there were 55 differ-
ent conditions.2 In total we collected over 81,000
judgments. Despite the large number of conditions
we managed to collect more than 1,000 judgments
for most of them. This provides a rich source of data
for analyzing the quality of translations produced by
different systems, the different types of human eval-
uation, and the correlation of automatic metrics with
human judgments.3
2We did not perform a constituent-based evaluation for
Czech to English because we did not have a syntactic parser
for Czech. We considered adapting our method to use Bojar
(2004)?s dependency parser for Czech, but did not have the time.
3The judgment data along with all system translations are
available at http://www.statmt.org/wmt07/
4 Automatic evaluation
The past two ACL workshops on machine trans-
lation used Bleu as the sole automatic measure of
translation quality. Bleu was used exclusively since
it is the most widely used metric in the field and
has been shown to correlate with human judgments
of translation quality in many instances (Dodding-
ton, 2002; Coughlin, 2003; Przybocki, 2004). How-
ever, recent work suggests that Bleu?s correlation
with human judgments may not be as strong as pre-
viously thought (Callison-Burch et al, 2006). The
results of last year?s workshop further suggested that
Bleu systematically underestimated the quality of
rule-based machine translation systems (Koehn and
Monz, 2006).
We used the manual evaluation data as a means of
testing the correlation of a range of automatic met-
rics in addition to Bleu. In total we used eleven
different automatic evaluation measures to rank the
shared task submissions. They are:

? Bleu (Papineni et al, 2002)?Bleu is currently
the de facto standard in machine translation
evaluation. It calculates n-gram precision and
a brevity penalty, and can make use of multi-
ple reference translations as a way of capturing
some of the allowable variation in translation.
We use a single reference translation in our ex-
periments.
? GTM (Melamed et al, 2003)?GTM general-
izes precision, recall, and F-measure to mea-
sure overlap between strings, rather than over-
lap between bags of items. An ?exponent? pa-
rameter which controls the relative importance
of word order. A value of 1.0 reduces GTM to
ordinary unigram overlap, with higher values
emphasizing order.4
? Translation Error Rate (Snover et al, 2006)?
4The GTM scores presented here are an F-measure with a
weight of 0.1, which counts recall at 10x the level of precision.
The exponent is set at 1.2, which puts a mild preference towards
items with words in the correct order. These parameters could
be optimized empirically for better results.
TER calculates the number of edits required to
change a hypothesis translation into a reference
translation. The possible edits in TER include
insertion, deletion, and substitution of single
words, and an edit which moves sequences of
contiguous words.
? ParaEval precision and ParaEval recall (Zhou
et al, 2006)?ParaEval matches hypothesis and
reference translations using paraphrases that
are extracted from parallel corpora in an unsu-
pervised fashion (Bannard and Callison-Burch,
2005). It calculates precision and recall using a
unigram counting strategy.
? Dependency overlap (Amigo? et al, 2006)?
This metric uses dependency trees for the hy-
pothesis and reference translations, by comput-
ing the average overlap between words in the
two trees which are dominated by grammatical
relationships of the same type.
? Semantic role overlap (Gime?nez and Ma`rquez,
2007)?This metric calculates the lexical over-
lap between semantic roles (i.e., semantic argu-
ments or adjuncts) of the same type in the the
hypothesis and reference translations. It uni-
formly averages lexical overlap over all seman-
tic role types.
143
? Word Error Rate over verbs (Popovic and Ney,
2007)?WER? creates a new reference and a
new hypothesis for each POS class by extract-
ing all words belonging to this class, and then
to calculate the standardWER.We show results
for this metric over verbs.
? Maximum correlation training on adequacy and
on fluency (Liu and Gildea, 2007)?a lin-
ear combination of different evaluation metrics
(Bleu, Meteor, Rouge, WER, and stochastic it-
erative alignment) with weights set to maxi-
mize Pearson?s correlation with adequacy and
fluency judgments. Weights were trained on
WMT-06 data.
The scores produced by these are given in the ta-
bles at the end of the paper, and described in Sec-
tion 5. We measured the correlation of the automatic
evaluation metrics with the different types of human
judgments on 12 data conditions, and report these in
Section 6.
5 Shared task results
The results of the human evaluation are given in Ta-
bles 9, 10, 11 and 12. Each of those tables present
four scores:
? FLUENCY and ADEQUACY are normalized ver-
sions of the five point scores described in Sec-
tion 3.1. The tables report an average of the
normalized scores.5
? RANK is the average number of times that a
system was judged to be better than any other
system in the sentence ranking evaluation de-
scribed in Section 3.2.
? CONSTITUENT is the average number of times
that a system was judged to be better than any
other system in the constituent-based evalua-
tion described in Section 3.3.
There was reasonably strong agreement between
these four measures at which of the entries was the
best in each data condition. There was complete
5Since different annotators can vary widely in how they as-
sign fluency and adequacy scores, we normalized these scores
on a per-judge basis using the method suggested by Blatz et al
(2003) in Chapter 5, page 97.

While we consider the human evaluation to be
primary, it is also interesting to see how the en-
tries were ranked by the various automatic evalua-
tion metrics. The complete set of results for the auto-
matic evaluation are presented in Tables 13, 14, 15,
and 16. An aggregate summary is provided in Table
4. The automatic evaluation metrics strongly favor
the University of Edinburgh, which garners 41% of
the top-ranked entries (which is partially due to the
fact it was entered in every language pair). Signif-
icantly, the automatic metrics disprefer SYSTRAN,
which was strongly favored in the human evaluation.
6 Meta-evaluation
In addition to evaluating the translation quality of
the shared task entries, we also performed a ?meta-
evaluation? of our evaluation methodologies.
6.1 Inter- and Intra-annotator agreement
We measured pairwise agreement among annotators
using the kappa coefficient (K) which is widely used
in computational linguistics for measuring agree-
ment in category judgments (Carletta, 1996). It is
defined as
K =
P (A)? P (E)
1? P (E)
where P (A) is the proportion of times that the an-
notators agree, and P (E) is the proportion of time
that they would agree by chance. We define chance
agreement for fluency and adequacy as 15 , since they
are based on five point scales, and for ranking as 13
Evaluation type P (A) P (E) K
Fluency (absolute) .630 .2 .537
Adequacy (absolute) .574 .2 .468
Fluency (relative) .690 .333 .535
Adequacy (relative) .696 .333 .544
Sentence ranking .749 .333 .623
Constituent ranking .825 .333 .738
Constituent ranking .842 .333 .762
(w/identical constituents)
Table 6: Kappa coefficient values for intra-annotator
agreement for the different types of manual evalua-
tion
since there are three possible out comes when rank-
ing the output of a pair of systems: A > B, A = B,
A < B.
For inter-annotator agreement we calculated
P (A) for fluency and adequacy by examining all
items that were annotated by two or more annota-
tors, and calculating the proportion of time they as-
signed identical scores to the same items. For the
ranking tasks we calculated P (A) by examining all
pairs of systems which had been judged by two or
more judges, and calculated the proportion of time
that they agreed that A > B, A = B, or A < B.
For intra-annotator agreement we did similarly, but
gathered items that were annotated on multiple oc-
casions by a single annotator.
Table 5 gives K values for inter-annotator agree-
ment, and Table 6 gives K values for intra-annoator
agreement. These give an indication of how often
different judges agree, and how often single judges
are consistent for repeated judgments, respectively.
The interpretation of Kappa varies, but according to
Landis and Koch (1977) 0??.2 is slight, .21??.4
is fair, .41??.6 is moderate, .61??.8 is substantial
and the rest almost perfect.
The K values for fluency and adequacy should
give us pause about using these metrics in the fu-
ture. When we analyzed them as they are intended to
be?scores classifying the translations of sentences
into different types?the inter-annotator agreement
was barely considered fair, and the intra-annotator
agreement was only moderate. Even when we re-
assessed fluency and adequacy as relative ranks the
agreements increased only minimally.

constituent ranksentence rankfluency+adequacy scoring
Figure 4: Distributions of the amount of time it took
to judge single sentences for the three types of man-
ual evaluation
The agreement on the other two types of man-
ual evaluation that we introduced were considerably
better. The both the sentence and constituent ranking
had moderate inter-annotator agreement and sub-
stantial intra-annotator agreement. Because the con-
stituent ranking examined the translations of short
phrases, often times all systems produced the same
translations. Since these trivially increased agree-
ment (since they would always be equally ranked)
we also evaluated the inter- and intra-annotator
agreement when those items were excluded. The
agreement remained very high for constituent-based
evaluation.
6.2 Timing
We used the web interface to collect timing infor-
mation. The server recorded the time when a set of
sentences was given to a judge and the time when
the judge returned the sentences. We divided the
time that it took to do a set by the number of sen-
tences in the set. The average amount of time that it
took to assign fluency and adequacy to a single sen-
tence was 26 seconds.6 The average amount of time
it took to rank a sentence in a set was 20 seconds.
The average amount of time it took to rank a high-
lighted constituent was 11 seconds. Figure 4 shows
the distribution of times for these tasks.
6Sets which took longer than 5 minutes were excluded from
these calculations, because there was a strong chance that anno-
tators were interrupted while completing the task.
These timing figures are promising because they
indicate that the tasks which the annotators were the
most reliable on (constituent ranking and sentence
ranking) were also much quicker to complete than
the ones that they were unreliable on (assigning flu-
ency and adequacy scores). This suggests that flu-
ency and adequacy should be replaced with ranking
tasks in future evaluation exercises.
6.3 Correlation between automatic metrics and
human judgments
To measure the correlation of the automatic metrics
with the human judgments of translation quality we
used Spearman?s rank correlation coefficient ?. We
opted for Spearman rather than Pearson because it
makes fewer assumptions about the data. Impor-
tantly, it can be applied to ordinal data (such as the
fluency and adequacy scales). Spearman?s rank cor-
relation coefficient is equivalent to Pearson correla-
tion on ranks.
After the raw scores that were assigned to systems
by an automatic metric and by one of our manual
evaluation techniques have been converted to ranks,
we can calculate ? using the simplified equation:
? = 1?
6
?
d2i
n(n2 ? 1)
where di is the difference between the rank for
systemi and n is the number of systems. The pos-
sible values of ? range between 1 (where all systems
are ranked in the same order) and?1 (where the sys-
tems are ranked in the reverse order). Thus an auto-
matic evaluation metric with a higher value for ? is
making predictions that are more similar to the hu-
man judgments than an automatic evaluation metric
with a lower ?.
Table 17 reports ? for the metrics which were
used to evaluate translations into English.7. Table
7 summarizes the results by averaging the correla-
tion numbers by equally weighting each of the data
conditions. The table ranks the automatic evalua-
tion metrics based on how well they correlated with
human judgments. While these are based on a rela-
tively few number of items, and while we have not
performed any tests to determine whether the dif-
ferences in ? are statistically significant, the results
7The Czech-English conditions were excluded since there
were so few systems
146
are nevertheless interesting, since three metrics have
higher correlation than Bleu:
? Semantic role overlap (Gime?nez and Ma`rquez,
2007), which makes its debut in the proceed-
ings of this workshop
? ParaEval measuring recall (Zhou et al, 2006),
which has a model of allowable variation in
translation that uses automatically generated
paraphrases (Callison-Burch, 2007)
? Meteor (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) which also
allows variation by introducing synonyms and
by flexibly matches words using stemming.
Tables 18 and 8 report ? for the six metrics which
were used to evaluate translations into the other lan-
guages. Here we find that Bleu and TER are the
closest to human judgments, but that overall the cor-
relations are much lower than for translations into
English.
7 Conclusions
Similar to last year?s workshop we carried out an ex-
tensive manual and automatic evaluation of machine
translation performance for translating from four
European languages into English, and vice versa.
This year we substantially increased the number of
automatic evaluation metrics and were also able to
nearly double the efforts of producing the human
judgments.
There were substantial differences in the results
results of the human and automatic evaluations. We
take the human judgments to be authoritative, and
used them to evaluate the automatic metrics. We
measured correlation using Spearman?s coefficient
and found that three less frequently used metrics
were stronger predictors of human judgments than
Bleu. They were: semantic role overlap (newly in-
troduced in this workshop) ParaEval-recall and Me-
teor.
Although we do not claim that our observations
are indisputably conclusive, they again indicate that
the choice of automatic metric can have a signifi-
cant impact on comparing systems. Understanding
the exact causes of those differences still remains an
important issue for future research.

This year?s evaluation also measured the agree-
ment between human assessors by computing the
Kappa coefficient. One striking observation is
that inter-annotator agreement for fluency and ad-
equacy can be called ?fair? at best. On the other
hand, comparing systems by ranking them manually
(constituents or entire sentences), resulted in much
higher inter-annotator agreement.

Abstract
This paper analyzes the translation qual-
ity of machine translation systems for 10
language pairs translating between Czech,
English, French, German, Hungarian, and
Spanish. We report the translation quality
of over 30 diverse translation systems based
on a large-scale manual evaluation involv-
ing hundreds of hours of effort. We use the
human judgments of the systems to analyze
automatic evaluation metrics for translation
quality, and we report the strength of the cor-
relation with human judgments at both the
system-level and at the sentence-level. We
validate our manual evaluation methodol-
ogy by measuring intra- and inter-annotator
agreement, and collecting timing informa-
tion.
1 Introduction
This paper presents the results the shared tasks of the
2008 ACL Workshop on Statistical Machine Trans-
lation, which builds on two past workshops (Koehn
andMonz, 2006; Callison-Burch et al, 2007). There
were two shared tasks this year: a translation task
which evaluated translation between 10 pairs of Eu-
ropean languages, and an evaluation task which ex-
amines automatic evaluation metrics.
There were a number of differences between this
year?s workshop and last year?s workshop:
? Test set selection ? Instead of creating our test
set by reserving a portion of the training data,
we instead hired translators to translate a set of
newspaper articles from a number of different
sources. This out-of-domain test set contrasts
with the in-domain Europarl test set.
? New language pairs ? We evaluated the qual-
ity of Hungarian-English machine translation.
Hungarian is a challenging language because it
is agglutinative, has many cases and verb con-
jugations, and has freer word order. German-
Spanish was our first language pair that did not
include English, but was not manually evalu-
ated since it attracted minimal participation.
? System combination ? Saarland University
entered a system combination over a number
of rule-based MT systems, and provided their
output, which were also treated as fully fledged
entries in the manual evaluation. Three addi-
tional groups were invited to apply their system
combination algorithms to all systems.
? Refined manual evaluation ? Because last
year?s study indicated that fluency and ade-
quacy judgments were slow and unreliable, we
dropped them from manual evaluation. We re-
placed them with yes/no judgments about the
acceptability of translations of shorter phrases.
? Sentence-level correlation ? In addition to
measuring the correlation of automatic evalu-
ation metrics with human judgments at the sys-
tem level, we also measured how consistent
they were with the human rankings of individ-
ual sentences.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 gives an overview of the shared
70
translation task, describing the test sets, the mate-
rials that were provided to participants, and a list of
the groups who participated. Section 3 describes the
manual evaluation of the translations, including in-
formation about the different types of judgments that
were solicited and how much data was collected.
Section 4 presents the results of the manual eval-
uation. Section 5 gives an overview of the shared
evaluation task, describes which automatic metrics
were submitted, and tells how they were evaluated.
Section 6 presents the results of the evaluation task.
Section 7 validates the manual evaluation methodol-
ogy.
2 Overview of the shared translation task
The shared translation task consisted of 10 language
pairs: English to German, German to English, En-
glish to Spanish, Spanish to English, English to
French, French to English, English to Czech, Czech
to English, Hungarian to English, and German to
Spanish. Each language pair had two test sets drawn
from the proceedings of the European parliament, or
from newspaper articles.1
2.1 Test data
The test data for this year?s task differed from previ-
ous years? data. Instead of only reserving a portion
of the training data as the test set, we hired people
to translate news articles that were drawn from a va-
riety of sources during November and December of
2007. We refer to this as the News test set. A total
of 90 articles were selected, 15 each from a variety
of Czech-, English-, French-, German-, Hungarian-
and Spanish-language news sites:2
Hungarian: Napi (3 documents), Index (2),
Origo (5), Ne?pszabadsa?g (2), HVG (2),
Uniospez (1)
Czech: Aktua?lne? (1), iHNed (4), Lidovky (7),
Novinky (3)
French: Liberation (4), Le Figaro (4), Dernieres
Nouvelles (2), Les Echos (3), Canoe (2)
1For Czech news editorials replaced the European parlia-
ment transcripts as the second test set, and for Hungarian the
newspaper articles was the only test set.
2For more details see the XML test files. The docid tag
gives the source and the date for each document in the test set,
and the origlang tag indicates the original source language.
Original source language avg. BLEU
Hungarian 8.8
German 11.0
Czech 15.2
Spanish 17.3
English 17.7
French 18.6
Table 1: Difficulty of the test set parts based on the
original language. For each part, we average BLEU
scores from the Edinburgh systems for 12 language
pairs of the shared task.
Spanish: Cinco Dias (7), ABC.es (3), El Mundo (5)
English: BBC (3), Scotsman (3), Economist (3),
Times (3), New York Times (3)
German: Financial Times Deutschland (3), Su?d-
deutsche Zeitung (3), Welt (3), Frankfurter All-
gemeine Zeitung (3), Spiegel (3)
The translations were created by the members of
EuroMatrix consortium who hired a mix of profes-
sional and non-professional translators. All trans-
lators were fluent or native speakers of both lan-
guages, and all translations were proofread by a na-
tive speaker of the target language. All of the trans-
lations were done directly, and not via an intermedi-
ate language. So for instance, each of the 15 Hun-
garian articles were translated into Czech, English,
French, German and Spanish. The total cost of cre-
ating the 6 test sets consisting of 2,051 sentences
in each language was approximately 17,200 euros
(around 26,500 dollars at current exchange rates, at
slightly more than 10c/word).
Having a test set that is balanced in six differ-
ent source languages and translated across six lan-
guages raises some interesting questions. For in-
stance, is it easier, when the machine translation sys-
tem translates in the same direction as the human
translator? We found no conclusive evidence that
shows this. What is striking, however, that the parts
differ dramatically in difficulty, based on the orig-
inal source language. For instance the Edinburgh
French-English system has a BLEU score of 26.8 on
the part that was originally Spanish, but a score of on
9.7 on the part that was originally Hungarian. For
average scores for each original language, see Ta-
ble 1.
71
In order to remain consistent with previous eval-
uations, we also created a Europarl test set. The
Europarl test data was again drawn from the tran-
scripts of EU parliamentary proceedings from the
fourth quarter of 2000, which is excluded from the
Europarl training data. Our rationale behind invest-
ing a considerable sum to create the News test set
was that we believe that it more accurately repre-
sents the quality of systems? translations than when
we simply hold out a portion of the training data
as the test set, as with the Europarl set. For in-
stance, statistical systems are heavily optimized to
their training data, and do not perform as well on
out-of-domain data (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007).
Having both the News test set and the Europarl test
set alows us to contrast the performance of systems
on in-domain and out-of-domain data, and provides
a fairer comparison between systems trained on the
Europarl corpus and systems that were developed
without it.
2.2 Provided materials
To lower the barrier of entry for newcomers to the
field, we provided a complete baseline MT system,
along with data resources. We provided:
? sentence-aligned training corpora
? language model data
? development and dev-test sets
? Moses open source toolkit for phrase-based sta-
tistical translation (Koehn et al, 2007)
The performance of this baseline system is similar
to the best submissions in last year?s shared task.
The training materials are described in Figure 1.
2.3 Submitted systems
We received submissions from 23 groups from 18
institutions, as listed in Table 2. We also eval-
uated seven additional commercial rule-based MT
systems, bringing the total to 30 systems. This is
a significant increase over last year?s shared task,
where there were submissions from 15 groups from
14 institutions. Of the 15 groups that participated in
last year?s shared task, 11 groups returned this year.
One of the goals of the workshop was to attract sub-
missions from newcomers to the field, and we are
please to have attracted many smaller groups, some
as small as a single graduate student and her adviser.
The 30 submitted systems represent a broad
range of approaches to statistical machine transla-
tion. These include statistical phrase-based and rule-
based (RBMT) systems (which together made up the
bulk of the entries), and also hybrid machine trans-
lation, and statistical tree-based systems. For most
language pairs, we assembled a solid representation
of the state of the art in machine translation.
In addition to individual systems being entered,
this year we also solicited a number of entries which
combined the results of other systems. We invited
researchers at BBN, Carnegie Mellon University,
and the University of Edinburgh to apply their sys-
tem combination algorithms to all of the systems
submitted to shared translation task. We designated
the translations of the Europarl set as the develop-
ment data for combination techniques which weight
each system.3 CMU combined the French-English
systems, BBN combined the French-English and
German-English systems, and Edinburgh submitted
combinations for the French-English and German-
English systems as well as a multi-source system
combination which combined all systems which
translated from any language pair into English for
the News test set. The University of Saarland also
produced a system combination over six commercial
RBMT systems (Eisele et al, 2008). Saarland gra-
ciously provided the output of these systems, which
we manually evaluated alongside all other entries.
For more on the participating systems, please re-
fer to the respective system descriptions in the pro-
ceedings of the workshop.
3 Human evaluation
As with last year?s workshop, we placed greater em-
phasis on the human evaluation than on the auto-
matic evaluation metric scores. It is our contention
that automatic measures are an imperfect substitute
for human assessment of translation quality. There-
fore, rather than select an official automatic eval-
uation metric like the NIST Machine Translation
Workshop does (Przybocki and Peterson, 2008), we
define the manual evaluation to be primary, and use
3Since the performance of systems varied significantly be-
tween the Europarl and News test sets, such weighting might
not be optimal. However this was a level playing field, since
none of the individual systems had development data for the
News set either.

the human judgments to validate automatic metrics.
Manual evaluation is time consuming, and it re-
quires a monumental effort to conduct it on the
scale of our workshop. We distributed the work-
load across a number of people, including shared
task participants, interested volunteers, and a small
number of paid annotators. More than 100 people
participated in the manual evaluation, with 75 peo-
ple putting in more than an hour?s worth of effort,
and 25 putting in more than four hours. A collective
total of 266 hours of labor was invested.
We wanted to ensure that we were using our anno-
tators? time effectively, so we carefully designed the
manual evaluation process. In our analysis of last
year?s manual evaluation we found that the NIST-
style fluency and adequacy scores (LDC, 2005) were
overly time consuming and inconsistent.4 We there-
fore abandoned this method of evaluating the trans-
lations.
We asked people to evaluate the systems? output
in three different ways:
? Ranking translated sentences relative to each
other
? Ranking the translations of syntactic con-
stituents drawn from the source sentence
? Assigning absolute yes or no judgments to the
translations of the syntactic constituents.
The manual evaluation software asked for re-
peated judgments from the same individual, and had
multiple people judge the same item, and logged the
time it took to complete each judgment. This al-
lowed us to measure intra- and inter-annotator agree-
ment, and to analyze the average amount of time it
takes to collect the different kinds of judgments. Our
analysis is presented in Section 7.
3.1 Ranking translations of sentences
Ranking translations relative to each other is a rela-
tively intuitive and straightforward task. We there-
fore kept the instructions simple. The instructions
for this task were:
4It took 26 seconds on average to assign fluency and ade-
quacy scores to a single sentence, and the inter-annotator agree-
ment had a Kappa of between .225?.25, meaning that annotators
assigned the same scores to identical sentences less than 40% of
the time.
Rank each whole sentence translation
from Best to Worst relative to the other
choices (ties are allowed).
Ranking several translations at a time is a variant
of force choice judgments where a pair of systems
is presented and an annotator is asked ?Is A better
than B, worse than B, or equal to B.? In our exper-
iments, annotators were shown five translations at a
time, except for the Hungarian and Czech language
pairs where there were fewer than five system sub-
missions. In most cases there were more than 5 sys-
tems submissions. We did not attempt to get a com-
plete ordering over the systems, and instead relied
on random selection and a reasonably large sample
size to make the comparisons fair.

3.2 Ranking translations of syntactic
constituents
We continued the constituent-based evaluation that
we piloted last year, wherein we solicited judgments
about the translations of short phrases within sen-
tences rather than whole sentences. We parsed the
source language sentence, selected syntactic con-
stituents from the tree, and had people judge the
translations of those syntactic phrases. In order to
draw judges? attention to these regions, we high-
lighted the selected source phrases and the corre-
sponding phrases in the translations. The corre-
sponding phrases in the translations were located via
automatic word alignments.
Figure 2 illustrates how the source and reference
phrases are highlighted via automatic word align-
ments. The same is done for sentence and each
of the system translations. The English, French,
German and Spanish test sets were automatically
parsed using high quality parsers for those languages
(Bikel, 2002; Arun and Keller, 2005; Dubey, 2005;
Bick, 2006).
The word alignments were created with Giza++
(Och and Ney, 2003) applied to a parallel corpus
containing the complete Europarl training data, plus
sets of 4,051 sentence pairs created by pairing the
test sentences with the reference translations, and
the test sentences paired with each of the system
translations. The phrases in the translations were
located using standard phrase extraction techniques
(Koehn et al, 2003). Because the word-alignments
were created automatically, and because the phrase
extraction is heuristic, the phrases that were selected
may not exactly correspond to the translations of the
selected source phrase. We noted this in the instruc-
tions to judges:
Rank each constituent translation from
Best to Worst relative to the other choices
(ties are allowed). Grade only the high-
lighted part of each translation.
Please note that segments are selected au-
tomatically, and they should be taken as
an approximate guide. They might in-
clude extra words that are not in the actual
alignment, or miss words on either end.
76
The criteria that we used to select which con-
stituents to evaluate were:
? The constituent could not be the whole source
sentence
? The constituent had to be longer three words,
and be no longer than 15 words
? The constituent had to have a corresponding
phrase with a consistent word alignment in
each of the translations
The final criterion helped reduce the number of
alignment errors, but may have biased the sample
to phrases that are more easily aligned.
3.3 Yes/No judgments for the translations of
syntactic constituents
This year we introduced a variant on the constituent-
based evaluation, where instead of asking judges
to rank the translations of phrases relative to each
other, we asked them to indicate which phrasal trans-
lations were acceptable and which were not.
Decide if the highlighted part of each
translation is acceptable, given the refer-
ence. This should not be a relative judg-
ment against the other system translations.
The instructions also contained the same caveat
about the automatic alignments as above. For each
phrase the judges could click on ?Yes?, ?No?, or
?Not Sure.? The number of times people clicked on
?Not Sure? varied by language pair and task. It was
selected as few as 5% of the time for the English-
Spanish News task to as many as 12.5% for the
Czech-English News task.
3.4 Collecting judgments
We collected judgments using a web-based tool that
presented judges with batches of each type of eval-
uation. We presented them with five screens of sen-
tence rankings, ten screens of constituent rankings,
and ten screen of yes/no judgments. The order of the
types of evaluation were randomized.
In order to measure intra-annotator agreement
10% of the items were repeated and evaluated twice
by each judge. In order to measure inter-annotator
agreement 40% of the items were randomly drawn
from a common pool that was shared across all
annotators so that we would have items that were
judged by multiple annotators.
Judges were allowed to select whichever data set
they wanted, and to evaluate translations into what-
ever languages they were proficient in. Shared task
participants were excluded from judging their own
systems.
In addition to evaluation each language pair indi-
vidually, we also combined all system translations
into English for the News test set, taking advantage
of the fact that our test sets were parallel across all
languages. This allowed us to gather interesting data
about the difficulty of translating from different lan-
guages into English.
Table 3 gives a summary of the number of judg-
ments that we collected for translations of individ-
ual sentences. We evaluated 14 translation tasks
with three different types of judgments for most of
them, for a total of 46 different conditions. In to-
tal we collected over 75,000 judgments. Despite the
large number of conditions we managed to collect
between 1,000?2,000 judgments for the constituent-
based evaluation, and several hundred to several
thousand judgments for the sentence ranking tasks.
4 Translation task results
Tables 4, 5, and 6 summarize the results of the hu-
man evaluation of the quality of the machine trans-
lation systems. Table 4 gives the results for the man-
ual evaluation which ranked the translations of sen-
tences. It shows the average number of times that
systems were judged to be better than or equal to
any other system. Table 5 similarly summarizes
the results for the manual evaluation which ranked
the translations of syntactic constituents. Table 6
shows how many times on average a system?s trans-
lated constituents were judged to be acceptable in
the Yes/No evaluation. The bolded items indicate
the system that performed the best for each task un-
der that particular evaluate metric.
Table 7 summaries the results for the All-English
task that we introduced this year. Appendix C gives
an extremely detailed pairwise comparison between
each of the systems, along with an indication of
whether the differences are statistically significant.
The highest ranking entry for the All-English task
77
was the University of Edinburgh?s system combina-
tion entry. It uses a technique similar to Rosti et
al. (2007) to perform system combination. Like the
other system combination entrants, it was tuned on
the Europarl test set and tested on the News test set,
using systems that submitted entries to both tasks.
The University of Edinburgh?s system combi-
nation went beyond other approaches by combin-
ing output from multiple languages pairs (French-
English, German-English and Spanish-English),
resulting in 37 component systems. Rather
than weighting individual systems, it incorporated
weighted features that indicated which language the
system was originally translating from. This entry
was part of ongoing research in multi-lingual, multi-
source translation. Since there was no official multi-
lingual system combination track, this entry should
be viewed only as a contrastive data point.
We analyzed the All-English judgments to see
which source languages were preferred more often,
thinking that this might be a good indication of how
challenging it is for current MT systems to trans-
late from each of the languages into English. For
this analysis we collapsed all of the entries derived
from one source language into an equivalence class,
and judged them against the others. Therefore, all
French systems were judged against all German sys-
tems, and so on. We found that French systems were
judged to be better than or equal to other systems
69% of the time, Spanish systems 64% of the time,
German systems 47% of the time, Czech systems
39% of the time, and Hungarian systems 29% of the
time.
We performed a similar analysis by collapsing the
RBMT systems into one equivalence class, and the
other systems into another. We evaluated how well
these two classes did on the sentence ranking task
for each language pair and test set, and found that
RBMT was a surprisingly good approach in many
of the conditions. RBMT generally did better on the
News test set and for translations into German, sug-
gesting that SMT?s forte is in test sets where it has
appropriate tuning data and for language pairs with
less reordering than between German and English.

Table 7: The average number of times that each
system was judged to be better than or equal to all
other systems in the sentence ranking task for the
All-English condition. The subscript indicates the
source language of the system.
5 Shared evaluation task overview
The manual evaluation data provides a rich source
of information beyond simply analyzing the qual-
ity of translations produced by different systems. In
particular, it is especially useful for validating the
automatic metrics which are frequently used by the
machine translation research community. We con-
tinued the shared task which we debuted last year,
by examining how well various automatic metrics
correlate with human judgments.
In addition to examining how well the automatic
evaluation metrics predict human judgments at the
system-level, this year we have also started to mea-
sure their ability to predict sentence-level judg-
ments.
The automatic metrics that were evaluated in this
year?s shared task were the following:
? Bleu (Papineni et al, 2002)?Bleu remains the
de facto standard in machine translation eval-
uation. It calculates n-gram precision and a
brevity penalty, and can make use of multi-
ple reference translations as a way of capturing
some of the allowable variation in translation.
We use a single reference translation in our ex-
periments.
? Meteor (Agarwal and Lavie, 2008)?Meteor
measures precision and recall for unigrams and
applies a fragmentation penalty. It uses flex-
ible word matching based on stemming and
WordNet-synonymy. A number of variants are
investigated here: meteor-baseline and meteor-
ranking are optimized for correlation with ad-
equacy and ranking judgments respectively.
mbleu and mter are Bleu and TER computed
using the flexible matching used in Meteor.
? Gimenez and Marquez (2008) measure over-
lapping grammatical dependency relationships
(DP), semantic roles (SR), and discourse repre-
sentations (DR). The authors further investigate
combining these with other metrics including
TER, Bleu, GTM, Rouge, and Meteor (ULC
and ULCh).
? Popovic and Ney (2007) automatically eval-
uate translation quality by examining se-
quences of parts of speech, rather than
words. They calculate Bleu (posbleu) and
F-measure (pos4gramFmeasure) by matching
part of speech 4grams in a hypothesis transla-
tion against the reference translation.
In addition to the above metrics, which scored
the translations on both the system-level5 and the
sentence-level, there were a number of metrics
which focused on the sentence-level:
? Albrecht and Hwa (2008) use support vector re-
gression to score translations using past WMT
manual assessment data as training examples.
The metric uses features derived from target-
side language models and machine-generated
translations (svm-pseudo-ref) as well as refer-
ence human translations (svm-human-ref).
? Duh (2008) similarly used support vector ma-
chines to predict an ordering over a set of
5We provide the scores assigned to each system by these
metrics in Appendix A.
80
system translations (svm-rank). Features in-
cluded in Duh (2008)?s training were sentence-
level BLEU scores and intra-set ranks com-
puted from the entire set of translations.
? USaar?s evaluation metric (alignment-prob)
uses Giza++ to align outputs of multiple sys-
tems with the corresponding reference transla-
tions, with a bias towards identical one-to-one
alignments through a suitably augmented cor-
pus. The Model4 log probabilities in both di-
rections are added and normalized to a scale
between 0 and 1.
5.1 Measuring system-level correlation
To measure the correlation of the automatic metrics
with the human judgments of translation quality at
the system-level we used Spearman?s rank correla-
tion coefficient ?. We converted the raw scores as-
signed each system into ranks. We assigned a rank-
ing to the systems for each of the three types of man-
ual evaluation based on:
? The percent of time that the sentences it pro-
duced were judged to be better than or equal to
the translations of any other system.
? The percent of time that its constituent transla-
tions were judged to be better than or equal to
the translations of any other system.
? The percent of time that its constituent transla-
tions were judged to be acceptable.
We calculated ? three times for each automatic met-
ric, comparing it to each type of human evaluation.
Since there were no ties ? can be calculated using
the simplified equation:
? = 1 ?
6
?
d2i
n(n2 ? 1)
where di is the difference between the rank for
systemi and n is the number of systems. The pos-
sible values of ? range between 1 (where all systems
are ranked in the same order) and?1 (where the sys-
tems are ranked in the reverse order). Thus an auto-
matic evaluation metric with a higher value for ? is
making predictions that are more similar to the hu-
man judgments than an automatic evaluation metric
with a lower ?.

5.2 Measuring consistency at the sentence-level
Measuring sentence-level correlation under our hu-
man evaluation framework was made complicated
by the fact that we abandoned the fluency and ad-
equacy judgments which are intended to be abso-
lute scales. Some previous work has focused on
developing automatic metrics which predict human
ranking at the sentence-level (Kulesza and Shieber,
2004; Albrecht and Hwa, 2007a; Albrecht and Hwa,
2007b). Such work generally used the 5-point flu-
ency and adequacy scales to combine the transla-
tions of all sentences into a single ranked list. This
list could be compared against the scores assigned
by automatic metrics and used to calculate corre-
lation coefficients. We did not gather any absolute
scores and thus cannot compare translations across
different sentences. Given the seemingly unreliable
fluency and adequacy assignments that people make
even for translations of the same sentences, it may
be dubious to assume that their scoring will be reli-
able across sentences.
The data points that we have available consist of a
set of 6,400 human judgments each ranking the out-
put of 5 systems. It?s straightforward to construct a
ranking of each of those 5 systems using the scores

Table 9: Average system-level correlations for the
automatic evaluation metrics on translations into
French, German and Spanish
assigned to their translations of that sentence by the
automatic evaluation metrics. When the automatic
scores have been retrieved, we have 6,400 pairs of
ranked lists containing 5 items. How best to treat
these is an open discussion, and certainly warrants
further thought. It does not seem like a good idea
to calculate ? for each pair of ranked list, because
5 items is an insufficient number to get a reliable
correlation coefficient and its unclear if averaging
over all 6,400 lists would make sense. Furthermore,
many of the human judgments of 5 contained ties,
further complicating matters.
Therefore rather than calculating a correlation co-
efficient at the sentence-level we instead ascertained
how consistent the automatic metrics were with the
human judgments. The way that we calculated con-
sistency was the following: for every pairwise com-
parison of two systems on a single sentence by a per-
son, we counted the automatic metric as being con-
sistent if the relative scores were the same (i.e. the
metric assigned a higher score to the higher ranked
system). We divided this by the total number of pair-
wise comparisons to get a percentage. Because the
systems generally assign real numbers as scores, we
excluded pairs that the human annotators ranked as
ties.

lations directions into English and out of English6
For the into English direction the Meteor score with
its parameters tuned on adequacy judgments had
the strongest correlation with ranking the transla-
tions of whole sentences. It was tied with the com-
bined method of Gimenez and Marquez (2008) for
the highest correlation over all three types of human
judgments. Bleu was the second to lowest ranked
overall, though this may have been due in part to the
fact that we were using test sets which had only a
single reference translation, since the cost of creat-
ing multiple references was prohibitively expensive
(see Section 2.1).
In the reverse direction, for translations out of En-
glish into the other languages, Bleu does consider-
ably better, placing second overall after the part-of-
speech variant on it proposed by Popovic and Ney
(2007). Yet another variant of Bleu which utilizes
Meteor?s flexible matching has the strongest corre-
lation for sentence-level ranking. Appendix B gives
a break down of the correlations for each of the lan-
6Tables 8 and 9 exclude the Spanish-English News Task,
since it had a negative correlation with most of the automatic
metrics. See Tables 19 and 20.

guage pairs and test sets.
Tables 10 and 11 report the consistency of the au-
tomatic evaluation metrics with human judgments
on a sentence-by-sentence basis, rather than on the
system level. For the translations into English the
ULC metric (which itself combines many other met-
rics) had the strongest correlation with human judg-
ments, correctly predicting the human ranking of a
each pair of system translations of a sentence more
than half the time. This is dramatically higher than
the chance baseline, which is not .5, since it must
correctly rank a list of systems rather than a pair. For
the reverse direction meteor-ranking performs very
strongly. The svn-rank which had the lowest over-
all correlation at the system level does the best at
consistently predicting the translations of syntactic
constituents into other languages.
7 Validation and analysis of the manual
evaluation
In addition to scoring the shared task entries, we also
continued on our campaign for improving the pro-
cess of manual evaluation.
7.1 Inter- and Intra-annotator agreement
We measured pairwise agreement among annotators
using the kappa coefficient (K) which is widely used
in computational linguistics for measuring agree-
ment in category judgments (Carletta, 1996). It is
defined as
K =
P (A) ? P (E)
1 ? P (E)
Evaluation type P (A) P (E) K
Sentence ranking .578 .333 .367
Constituent ranking .671 .333 .506
Constituent (w/identicals) .678 .333 .517
Yes/No judgments .821 .5 .642
Yes/No (w/identicals) .825 .5 .649
Table 12: Kappa coefficient values representing the
inter-annotator agreement for the different types of
manual evaluation
Evaluation type P (A) P (E) K
Sentence ranking .691 .333 .537
Constituent ranking .825 .333 .737
Constituent (w/identicals) .832 .333 .748
Yes/No judgments .928 .5 .855
Yes/No (w/identicals) .930 .5 .861
Table 13: Kappa coefficient values for intra-
annotator agreement for the different types of man-
ual evaluation
where P (A) is the proportion of times that the an-
notators agree, and P (E) is the proportion of time
that they would agree by chance. We define chance
agreement for ranking tasks as 13 since there are
three possible outcomes when ranking the output of
a pair of systems: A > B, A = B, A < B, and for
the Yes/No judgments as 12 since we ignored those
items marked ?Not Sure?.
For inter-annotator agreement we calculated
P (A) for the yes/no judgments by examining all
items that were annotated by two or more annota-
tors, and calculating the proportion of time they as-
signed identical scores to the same items. For the
ranking tasks we calculated P (A) by examining all
pairs of systems which had been judged by two or
more judges, and calculated the proportion of time
that they agreed that A > B, A = B, or A < B.
For intra-annotator agreement we did similarly, but
gathered items that were annotated on multiple oc-
casions by a single annotator.
Table 12 givesK values for inter-annotator agree-
ment, and Table 13 gives K values for intra-
annotator agreement. These give an indication of
how often different judges agree, and how often sin-
gle judges are consistent for repeated judgments, re-
83
spectively. The interpretation of Kappa varies, but
according to Landis and Koch (1977), 0?.2 is slight,
.2? .4 is fair, .4? .6 is moderate, .6? .8 is substan-
tial and the rest almost perfect. The inter-annotator
agreement for the sentence ranking task was fair, for
the constituent ranking it was moderate and for the
yes/no judgments it was substantial.7 For the intra-
annotator agreement K indicated that people had
moderate consistency with their previous judgments
on the sentence ranking task, substantial consistency
with their previous constituent ranking judgments,
and nearly perfect consistency with their previous
yes/no judgments.
These K values indicate that people are able to
more reliably make simple yes/no judgments about
the translations of short phrases than they are to
rank phrases or whole sentences. While this is an
interesting observation, we do not recommend do-
ing away with the sentence ranking judgments. The
higher agreement on the constituent-based evalua-
tion may be influenced based on the selection cri-
teria for which phrases were selected for evalua-
tion (see Section 3.2). Additionally, the judgments
of the short phrases are not a great substitute for
sentence-level rankings, at least in the way we col-
lected them. The average correlation coefficient be-
tween the constituent-based judgments with the sen-
tence ranking judgments is only ? = 0.51. Tables
19 and 20 give a detailed break down of the cor-
relation of the different types of human judgments
with each other on each translation task. It may
be possible to select phrases in such a way that the
constituent-based evaluations are a better substitute
for the sentence-based ranking, for instance by se-
lecting more of constituents from each sentence, or
attempting to cover most of the words in each sen-
tence in a phrase-by-phrase manner. This warrants
further investigation. It might also be worthwhile to
refine the instructions given to annotators about how
to rank the translations of sentences to try to improve
their agreement, which is currently lower than we
would like it to be (although it is substantially bet-
ter than the previous fluency and adequacy scores,
7Note that for the constituent-based evaluations we verified
that the high K was not trivially due to identical phrasal trans-
lations. We excluded screens where all five phrasal translations
presented to the annotator were identical, and report both num-
bers.

ual evaluation
which had a K < .25 in last year?s evaluation).
7.2 Timing
We used the web interface to collect timing infor-
mation. The server recorded the time when a set of
sentences was given to a judge and the time when
the judge returned the sentences. It took annotators
an average of 18 seconds per sentence to rank a list
of sentences.8 It took an average of 10 seconds per
sentence for them to rank constituents, and an av-
erage of 8.5 seconds per sentence for them to make
yes/no judgments. Figure 3 shows the distribution
of times for these tasks.
These timing figures indicate that the tasks which
the annotators were the most reliable on (yes/no
judgments and constituent ranking) were also much
quicker to complete than the ones they were less re-
liable on (ranking sentences). Given that they are
faster at judging short phrases, they can do propor-
tionally more of them. For instance, we could collect
211 yes/no judgments in the same amount of time
that it would take us to collect 100 sentence ranking
judgments. However, this is partially offset by the
fact that many of the translations of shorter phrases
are identical, which means that we have to collect
more judgments in order to distinguish between two
systems.
8Sets which took longer than 5 minutes were excluded from
these calculations, because there was a strong chance that anno-
tators were interrupted while completing the task.
84
7.3 The potential for re-usability of human
judgments
One strong advantage of the yes/no judgments over
the ranking judgments is their potential for reuse.
We have invested hundreds of hours worth of effort
evaluating the output of the translation systems sub-
mitted to this year?s workshop and last year?s work-
shop. While the judgments that we collected pro-
vide a wealth of information for developing auto-
matic evaluation metrics, we cannot not re-use them
to evaluate our translation systems after we update
their parameters or change their behavior in anyway.
The reason for this is that altered systems will pro-
duce different translations than the ones that we have
judged, so our relative rankings of sentences will no
longer be applicable. However, the translations of
short phrases are more likely to be repeated than the
translations of whole sentences.
Therefore if we collect a large number of yes/no
judgments for short phrases, we could build up a
database that contains information about what frag-
mentary translations are acceptable for each sen-
tence in our test corpus. When we change our sys-
tem and want to evaluate it, we do not need to man-
ually evaluate those segments that match against the
database, and could instead have people evaluate
only those phrasal translations which are new. Ac-
cumulating these judgments over time would give
a very reliable idea of what alternative translations
were allowable. This would be useful because it
could alleviate the problems associated with Bleu
failing to recognize allowable variation in translation
when multiple reference translations are not avail-
able (Callison-Burch et al, 2006). A large database
of human judgments might also be useful as an
objective function for minimum error rate training
(Och, 2003) or in other system development tasks.
8 Conclusions
Similar to previous editions of this workshop we car-
ried out an extensive manual and automatic evalua-
tion of machine translation performance for trans-
lating from European languages into English, and
vice versa. One important aspect in which this year?s
shared task differed from previous years was the in-
troduction of an additional newswire test set that
was different in nature to the training data. We
also added new language pairs to our evaluation:
Hungarian-English and German-Spanish.
As in previous years we were pleased to notice an
increase in the number of participants. This year we
received submissions from 23 groups from 18 insti-
tutions. In addition, we evaluated seven commercial
rule-based MT systems.
The goal of this shared-task is two-fold: First we
want to compare state-of-the-art machine translation
systems, and secondly we aim to measure to what
extent different evaluation metrics can be used to as-
sess MT quality.
With respect to MT quality we noticed that the in-
troduction of test sets from a different domain did
have an impact on the ranking of systems. We ob-
served that rule-based systems generally did better
on the News test set. Overall, it cannot be con-
cluded that one approach clearly outperforms other
approaches, as systems performed differently on the
various translation tasks. One general observation is
that for the tasks where statistical combination ap-
proaches participated, they tended to score relatively
high, in particular with respect to Bleu.
With respect to measuring the correlation between
automated evaluation metrics and human judgments
we found that using Meteor and ULCh (which uti-
lizes a variety of metrics, including Meteor) resulted
in the highest Spearman correlation scores on aver-
age, when translating into English. When translat-
ing from English into French, German, and Spanish,
Bleu and posbleu resulted in the highest correlations
with human judgments.
Finally, we investigated inter- and intra-annotator
agreement of human judgments using Kappa coef-
ficients. We noticed that ranking whole sentences
results in relatively low Kappa coefficients, mean-
ing that there is only fair agreement between the as-
sessors. Constituent ranking and acceptability judg-
ments on the other hand showmoderate and substan-
tial inter-annotator agreement, respectively. Intra-
annotator agreement was substantial to almost per-
fect, except for the sentence ranking assessment
where agreement was only moderate. Although it
is difficult to draw exact conclusions from this, one
might wonder whether the sentence ranking task is
simply too complex, involving too many aspects ac-
cording to which translations can be ranked.
The huge wealth of the data generated by this
85
workshop, including the human judgments, system
translations and automatic scores, is available at
http://www.statmt.org/wmt08/ for other
researchers to analyze.

Table 20: Correlation of automatic evaluation metrics with the three types of human judgments for transla-
tion into other languages
94
C Pairwise system comparisons by human judges
The following tables show pairwise comparisons between systems for each language pair, test set, and
manual evaluation type. The numbers in each of the tables? cells indicate the percent of that the system in
that column was judged to be better than the system in that row. Bolding indicates the winner of the two
systems. The difference between 100 and the sum of the complimentary cells is the percent of time that the
two systems were judged to be equal.
Because there were so many systems and data conditions the significance of each pairwise comparison
needs to be quantified. We applied the Sign Test to measure which comparisons indicate genuine differ-
ences (rather than differences that are attributable to chance). In the following tables ? indicates statistical
significance at p <= 0.05 and ? indicates statistical significance at p <= 0.01, according to the Sign Test.
