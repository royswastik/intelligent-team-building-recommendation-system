Recent years have shown a surge in interest in 
temporal database systems, which allow users to 
store time-dependent intbrmation. We present 
a novel controlled natural anguage interface to 
temporal databases, based on translating nat- 
ural language questions into SQL/Telnporal, a 
temporal database query language. The syn- 
tactic analysis is done using the Type-Logical 
Grammar framework, highlighting its utility not; 
only as a theoretical fralnework but also as a 
practical tool. The semantic analysis is done 
using a novel theory of the semantics of tempo- 
ral questions, focusing on the role of temporal 
preposition phrases rather than the more tradi- 
tional focus on tense and aspect. Our transla- 
tion method is considerably simpler than pre- 
vious attempts in this direction. We present a 
prototype software implementation. 
1 I n t roduct ion  
Traditionally, database management systems 
were designed to store snapshot information, 
valid at a particular moment of time (state). 
Itowever, many applications require handling 
dynamic time-dependent information, pertain- 
ing not only to the present, but also to the 
past and future. Adding temporal support 
to databases has proved to be a surprisingly

thorny issue (Tansel et el., 1993). A re- 
cent drive to consolidate research efforts has 
led to the design of a consensus temporal 
data model and associated temporal database 
query language, SQL/Temporal, an extension 
of the popular Structured Query Language 
(SQL) (Snodgrass, 2000). 1 SQL/?J)enlpora\] rep- 
resents a significant improvement over standard 
SQL in allowing programmers to express tem- 
poral queries (Snodgrass, 2000). Since tempo- 
ral database (TI)B) implementations are still 
in their infancy (Boehlen, 1995), there is lit- 
tle practical experience with SQL/Temporal; let 
alone experience of non-expert users. However, 
it; is our belief that such users are bound to find 
the expression of complex temporal queries in 
SQL/Temporal to be extremely difficult. 
In an attempt o counter this problem, we 
present a translation method from controlled 
natural anguage (NL) to SQL/Temporal. Fol- 
lowing the standard pipeline architecture of 
such methods, translation is done via an inter- 
mediate meaning representation language illus- 
trated in Figure 1. NL questions are first parsed 
using a grammar in the Type Logical Gram- 
mar (TLG) framework (Carpenter, 1998; Mor- 
rill, 1.998). Simultaneously with parsing, the NL 
question is translated into a formula of a for- 
mal language called Lane, (Toman, 11.996), based 
on the interval operators of (Allen, 1983). The 
translation is based on an independently moti- 
vated novel semantics of sentences modified by 
temporal Preposition Ph, rases (PPs) (Pratt and 
Francez 1997; 2000, Nelken and Francez 1999). 
The constructed LAno. formula is then trans- 
tThrough continued design, SQL/Temporal has 
evolved from predecessor versions named TSQL2 (Snod- 
grass, 1.995) and ATSQL2 (Boehlen et el., 1996). It is 
expected to be incorporated within the new version of 
SQL named SQL3.

subsequently submitted to a. l)rototyl)e TI)B im- 
plementation for eva.luation. Finally, the TI)B's 
answer is 1)resented to the user. 
Figure 1: The tr~nslation pipeline 
We have implemented this method as a pro- 
totype software tool, called Q IYEI~TY, (allnost) 
an acronym lbr "Querying with 15'nglish, of l~cla- 
rio'hal Temporal Databases". Parsing and trans- 
la.tion to I,Alle,, is done using the TLG Theo- 
rem Prover (C~u:penter, 1999). The trmlslation 
from \['allen to SQL/Temporal is done using an 
adaptation of a tempera.1 logic (Ti,) to Aq'SQL2 
translator of (Boehlen et al, 1996). The result- 
lag query is submitted to a prototype TI)B im- 
plementation, calle(l Timel)\]} (Steiner, 1{)97). 
T'he different modules are COul)led into an inte- 
grated system iml)lemented in Sicstus 1)rolog on 
a. UNIX platform with a WW\?-l)ased gral)hi-- 
caJ fi'ont-end. We discuss some of the directions 
required in order to turn the system fi:om a. re- 
search prototype to a working tool. 
2 Related  work  
There is voluminous litera.ture on the design 
of Nil, interfaces to general (non-tenq)oral) 
databa.ses (see (lYrrault and Grosz, \]988; 
Col)estake and Jones, 1990; Androutsopoulos et
al ,  1995) for surveys) and by now their main 
a,:lva.ntages and disadvantages are well under- 
stood. Much less work has been devoted to 
the design of Nil, interfa.ces to TDBs (C'lifford, 
1990; Hinrichs, 1988) or other computer sys- 
t(.'nls involving a temporal dimension (Crouch 
and l)ulnm.n, 71993). ()f lYa, rticular relevance 
is (Androutsopoulos, 1996), who presents a lin- 
guistically motivated translation method fi'om 
NL queries into TSQL2 using a.n ltl)SG (Pol- 
la, rd and Sag, 1.994) grammar and a TL as an 
intermediate representation language. Our al)- 
1)l:oach shares many characte.ristics with (An- 
d routsopoulos, 1996), but there also important 
difl'erences, which we point out throughout the 
paper. 
\?e I)egin our presentation of the. translation 
method with a brief overview of the T\])I}, as its 
structure determines many of the deign choices 
ta.lw.n in devising the translation method. 
3 The  TDB 
A TDB is a two-sorted tirst-oMer structure. 
The domain consists of a Data Do'main, D, and 
a Temporal Domain of intervals, 7'/, detined 
as follows. Let Tp 1)e a. set (of time points) 
with a discrete linear order without endl)oints, 
<._ .7'1 is defined as the set of pairs : 7) = 
Z,)la _< b c Tu{-oo ,  oo}}. a rdational 
database schema is a set, of single-sorted pred- 
icate symbols (H,1,..., l~k). Given a relational 
database schelna p, a Tl)l} schema p' is the sol; 
3/  of two-sorted predicate sylnbols (l?11,..., \]~), 
where the sort of /?~ is D aritv(l~i) x TI. A 
TI)13 instance of schema f is a set of relations 
R\[ C l) arity(l{i) X 7), where each R~ is finite. 
For instance, assume a database schema p 
consisting era  single binary predicate symbol 
'work, storing lbr each elnployee the department 
ill which she is employed. The Tl)l} schema 
p' consists of the relation wo'rk', called a valid- 
ti'mc state table, which adds a. temporal argu- 
nlent 1;o the original relation, caJled the valid- 
time of the table. '\['he temporal argument can 
be used to store the history (and 1)erhaps even 
future plans) of departments in which eml)loyees 
are employed. Following a. suggestion of (An- 
droutsopoulos, 1996), we also include relations 
mal)l)ing names of ca.lendricat i ems to tempo- 
ral intervals in p'. For instance, we store a. rela- 
tion year  / ma.l)l)ing the year 2000 to the interval 
\[71. \].2(100-3 J. 12.2000\] (which in turn is n lappe(t 
to an element of 7)). 
We now describe the translation process. 
4 The  t rans la t ion  process  
The translation 1)recess a.ccepts input NL ques- 
tions in a controlled subset of Nil,. Restrict- 
ing inl)ut language in this way enables e\[l'ective 
processing of a sufficiently rich fragment while 
avoiding many of the well-know problems of un- 
restricted NI,. We use a formal grammar in the 
TLG framework. Our grammar is specially de- 
signed for use with ~ particular TDB schema. 
Future work will allow easier configuration of 
the grammar with respect o the schema. 
Our grammar is based on work on all inde- 
pendently motivated theory of the semantics of 
telnt)orality. Most of the research in this tield 
(see (Steedman, 1997) for a survey) has rocllsed 
on the issues of tense a.nd aspect. \~e ha.ndle 
tense, but purposefully not aspect, which plays 
1077 
an import,~nt role in (Androutsol)oulos , 1996). 
Aspect, which is used to retlect speal~ers' tempo- 
ral viewpoint with respect o reported situations 
is an imi)ortant facet of NL temporality. How- 
ever, its relevance to TDBs is questionable, as it 
is unlikely that a realistic TDI3 would actually 
encode such subjective viewpoints. Moreover, 
handling aspect requires postulating a more 
complex data model. For instance, (Androut- 
sopoulos, 1996) augments tile TDB model with 
event-like "occurrence klentifiers", and adds a.n 
additional argument to temt)oral relations indi- 
cating whether a given event has cuhninated or 
not. While such devices may perhaps be linguis- 
tically justified, it is unclear whether the TDI3 
community would adopt such augmentations of 
the model. 
Instead, following (Pratt and Vrancez, 2000; 
Nelken and Francez, 1999) our focus is on sen- 
tences modified by temporal PPs. These PPs 
are analyzed as variants of standard general- 
ized quantifiers (Barwise and Cooper, 1981), 
in which qnantification is over: time. Using 
this framework, we handle questions that re- 
fer explicitly to the temporal (timension (e.g. 
When/during which year . . . )  as well as ques- 
tions in which temporality is hnplied by the 
TI)B context (e.g. Did Mary work in marketing?, 
Which employees worked in marketing?). We ban- 
(lie both clausal a.nd phrasal teml)ora\] Pl)s (e.g. 
after John worked in R&D, during every year). J\n 
important strength of this semantic theory is 
that it; allows for arbitrary iteration of PPs (e.g. 
one month during every year until 1992). In ad- 
dition, our grammar also handles qua.ntific~tion 
over individuals (e.g. some employee), coordina- 
tion and negation. 
input questions are parsed using a lexicalized 
type-logical grammar. Lexical items are ass(> 
elated with a syntactic ategory and a higher- 
order lambda-term representing its semantics. 
Taking advantage of 'I'LG's elegantly tight cou- 
pling of syntax and semantics, parsing and con- 
struction of a semantic representation i the 
form of an LAl le n Ibrmula proceed silnultane- 
onsly, in a bottom-up fashion. \?e have found 
using TLG to be advantageous over a feature- 
structure based formalism (such as IIPSG as 
in (A ndroutsopoulos, 1996)), since formula con- 
struction is an integral part of the l)arslng and 
does not require complex ad-hoc manipulations 
of feature structures. 
Using a particular grammar helps reduce 
some of the ambiguity inherent in unrestricted 
NL. For instance, whereas in general a preposi- 
tion such as at is ambiguous between a tempo- 
ral and a locative interpretation, the choice of 
the coml)lement NP relative to a given schema- 
induced grammar deterministically fixes the in- 
terpretation. As another example, whereas it- 
erating several temporal PPs (e.g. during some 
month every year) opens up exponential seep- 
ing possibilities, some choices are eliminated by 
world knowledge, which is encoded in the gram- 
mar (e.g. every year must have higher scope than 
some month since months are included in years 
and not vice-versa). In cases of remaining ambi- 
guity, Cite user is presented with all Cite distinct 
possibilities. Future work will allow the user: to 
lnalce informed choices between different possi- 
ble readings, e.g. by presenting him with NL 
l)ara.phrases of the alternatives. 
\?e translate NI, questions into \],All(',,,- i f ' ire 
main reason for: not translating directly to 
SQl,/Temporal is that the \]atter is not closed 
\['or sub-formulae, i.e. a sub-formula of a well- 
formed query is not necessarily well-formed. 
Since LAne, "is closed for" sub-formulae, composi- 
tionally constructing formulae while parsing in 
a bottom-u 1)fashion becomes much easier. 
I, An~, is defined as follows (Toman, 1996). 
I,et p be the database schema (1~, . . . ,  I~t,.). l,et: 
L ::=/~,~(x, I)ILA LI~LI~x.LI~I.LIx = yllc~J 
where x ,y  are variables over D, x is a vector 
of such variables, l, J are varlet)los or constants 
over T\], and (r is one of the operators: precedes, 
meets, overlaps, equals, contains. LAlien is de- 
fined as tile set of' \[brmulae p E L that con- 
Lain at most one free variable over TI. The 
answer to a formula 90 relative to a TDB D is 
{x, l l> ~ :(x,  :)}. 
To illustrate, consider the NL question: 
During which years did Mary work in marketing? 
'File I ,Alle n representation for" it is constructed in
a bottom-up nla, nnel'. The meaning representa- 
tion of the main clause Mary worked in marketing 
is constructed as: 
A J  _ /) 
In this formula, I denotes a Reichenbachian- 
like reference time, J denotes a time interval

Abstract
Unification grammars are known to be Turing-
equivalent; given a grammar   and a word  , it is
undecidable whether   	 . In order to ensure
decidability, several constraints on grammars, com-
monly known as off-line parsability (OLP) were
suggested. The recognition problem is decidable for
grammars which satisfy OLP. An open question is
whether it is decidable if a given grammar satisfies
OLP. In this paper we investigate various definitions
of OLP, discuss their inter-relations and show that
some of them are undecidable.
1 Introduction
Context-free grammars are considered to lack the
expressive power needed for modelling natural lan-
guages. Unification grammars have originated as an
extension of context-free grammars, the basic idea
being to augment the context-free rules with fea-
ture structures (FSs) in order to express additional
information. Today, several variants of unification
grammars exist, some of which do not necessarily
assume an explicit context-free backbone.
The recognition problem (also known as the
membership problem), for a grammar   and a string
 , is whether 
  	 . The parsing problem, for
a grammar   and a string  , is to deliver all parse
trees that   induces on  , determining what struc-
tural descriptions are assigned by   to  . The rest
of this paper is concerned with recognition.
Unification grammars have the formal power of
Turing machines, thus the recognition problem for
them is undecidable. In order to ensure decidability
of the recognition problem, a constraint called off-
line parsability (OLP) was suggested. The recog-
nition problem is decidable for OLP grammars.
There exist several variants of OLP in the literature
(Pereira and Warren, 1983; Johnson, 1988; Haas,
1989; Torenvliet and Trautwein, 1995; Shieber,
1992; Wintner and Francez, 1999; Kuhn, 1999).
Some variants of OLP were suggested without
recognizing the existence of all other variants. In
this paper we make a comparative analysis of the
different OLP variants for the first time. Some re-
searchers (Haas, 1989; Torenvliet and Trautwein,
1995) conjecture that some of the OLP variants are
undecidable (it is undecidable whether a grammar
satisfies the constraint), although none of them gives
any proof of it. There exist some variants of OLP
for which decidability holds, but these conditions
are too restrictive; there is a large class of non-OLP
grammars for which parsing termination is guaran-
teed. Our main contribution is to show proofs of
undecidability for three OLP definitions.
Section 2 defines the basic concepts of our for-
malism. Section 3 discusses the different OLP defi-
nitions. Section 4 gives an analysis of several OLP
definitions and the inter-relations among them. Sec-
tion 5 proves the undecidability of three of the OLP
conditions.
2 Preliminaries
The following definitions are based on Francez
and Wintner (In preperation) and Carpenter (1992).
Grammars are defined over a finite set FEATS of fea-
tures, a finite set ATOMS of atoms, and a finite set
CATS of categories. A multi-rooted feature struc-
ture (MRS) is a pair  	 where    
