Abstract 
The main purpose of this paper is the ex-
ploitation and application of an audio and 
video bimodal corpus of the Chinese lan-
guage in broadcasting. It deals with the 
designation of the size and structure of 
speech samples according to radio and 
television program features. Secondly, it 
discusses annotation method of broadcast 
speech with achievements made and sug-
gested future improvements. Finally, it 
presents an attempt to describe the distri-
bution of annotated items in our corpus. 
1 Introduction 
Since the year of 2002, we?ve been engaged in 
setting up the Media Language Corpus aimed to 
provide the language resources for the research-
ers who are interested in broadcasting and televi-
sion media language, for teachers and for re-
searchers of presentation art. Up till now, we 
have established a 50 million word text corpus 
involving 40 million word television program 
text corpora and 10 million word radio program 
text corpora with 10 million annotated word cor-
pora. The work of this paper is to introduce a 
ten-hour segmented and prosodic labeled broad-
cast audio & video bimodal corpus that we built 
just now. 
Section 2 of this paper describes a method for 
selection of radio and television programs to re-
cord according to program features on radio and 
television stations. Recording conditions are pro-
posed to record a quality spoken language corpus. 
Section 3 is dedicated to annotation methods. 
Section 4 shows the distribution of syllables, ini-
tials, finals and tones etc. Finally, section 5 con-
tains the conclusion and outlines of our future 
work in this field. 
2 Corpus Information 
2.1 Corpus metadata 
First of all, we have to select radio and television 
programs to record. Since a broadcast bimodal 
corpus should represent the real life usages of 
spoken language in radio and television, the dif-
ferences between radio and television, the differ-
ences between central and local televisions, and 
the categories of programs should all together be 
taken into account during the process of collect-
ing. The followings are the framework (.wav 
files & .mpeg files matched with .txt files) of 
head information (metadata) of broadcast audio 
& video bimodal corpus that has been collected:

 2.2 Corpus structure 
The purpose of building the broadcast spoken 
language corpus is to provide the service for the 
research of broadcast spoken language, esp. for 
the contrastive studies of the prosodic features of 
different genres of broadcast language. Hence, 
the selections of samples of the corpus mainly 
involve monologues, dialogues or both. As the 
performing forms of radio and television pro-
grams are getting more and more diverse, it is 
very difficult to decide whether a program is a 
monologue or dialogue, because these two gen-
res of programs often co-occur in one program. 
Furthermore, these kinds of programs are in-
creasing their share of radio and television pro-
grams. Consequently, this kind of program is 
most frequent in the corpus. Table 1 displays the 
structural framework of the broadcast audio and 
video bimodal corpus.

2.3 Recording & management information 
All the recorded data are over the programs on 
radio and TV, that is, it is recorded directly from 
radio and TV programs by Pinnacle PCTV pro 
card to connect cable TV with our recording 
computers. The recorded speech data are saved 
as 22 kHz and 16bit, Windows PCM waveform, 
the video data are saved as MPEG or WMV for-
mat file by Ulead VideoStudio in a post-
processing step. Every program or segment of 
programs is composed of three parts: *.wav 
data, *.txt data, and *.mpeg/.wmv data. 
Zhao Shixia et al(2000) pointed out that the 
structure of a speech corpus consists of synchro-
nized objects (text files, wav files, and annotated 
prosodic files), arranged in deep hierarchies (re-
cording environment), and labeled with speaker-
attribute metadata. Therefore, the managed ob-
jects of our broadcast bimodal corpus are inte-
grated programs or segments of programs. All 
data are stored separately but have complex logi-
cal inter-relations. These inter-relations can be 
obtained through the description of the programs. 
Figure 1 displays the logical structure of the 
broadcast bimodal corpus.

3 Annotation 
Why should we annotate a corpus? An annota-
tion is the fundamental act of associating some 
content to a region in a signal. The annotation 
quality and depth have a direct impact on the 
utility and possible applications of the corpus 
(Ding Xinshan 1998). The annotation of our cor-
pus consists of transcription, segmental annota-
tion, and prosodic annotation. 
3.1 Transcription and segmentation 
Transcription is primarily composed of pinyin 
transcription of Chinese characters. Besides, 
tones are annotated ?1?, ?2?, ?3?, and  ?4? after 
the syllable, the neutral tone is labeled ?0?; final 
??? annotated as ?v?, and ??e? annotated as ?ue?, 
for example, ?? (l?)? annotated as ?lv3?, ?? 
(n??)? annotated as ?nue4?. 
In the utterance, compared with broken sylla-
bles, successive speech alters greatly, due to the 
influence of co-articulation, semantics and pros-
ody. The purpose of segmental annotating is to 
annotate the altered phonemes in the syllables 
amidst the utterance. For instances, the voicing 
of some plosives (e.g. b, d, g); labial?s influence 
on alveolar nasal (e.g. ?-n? in ?renmin? affected 
by the initial of ?min? gradually change into 
?labionasal??demonstrating the similarities be-
tween alveolar nasal and labionasal initial in the 
frequency spectrum). In the places of unapparent 
pauses, the stop in the front of plosives esp. af-
103
fricates often vanishes, which are called the in-
existence of silence.  
We transcription and segmentation we used 
BSCA (Broadcasting Speech Corpus Annotator) 
which was designed by ourselves (Hu Fengguo 
and Zou Yu 2005). An annotated example is 
shown in Figure 2: 
 
 
Figure 2 BSCA: a tool for annotation 
3.2 Prosodic annotation tiers 
Prosodic annotation increases the utility of a 
speech corpus. An annotated speech corpus can 
not only offer us a database for the research and 
exploration of speech information but can also 
enlarge our knowledge of speech and prosodic 
features through a visual and scientific method. 
Prosodic annotation is a categorical descrip-
tion for the prosodic features with linguistic 
functions, in other words, annotation of the 
changes of tone, the patterns of stress, and the 
prosodic structure with linguistic functions. The 
prosodic labeling conventions are a set of ma-
chine-readable codes for transforming speech 
prosodies and rule conventions. Based on ToBI   
(Kim Silverman et al 1992, John F. Pitrelli et al 
1994) and C-ToBI Conventions (Li Aijun 2002), 
according to the practical needs of broadcast 
speech language, the prosodic annotation mainly 
involves labeling the following parallel tiers: 
break index, stress index, and intonation con-
struction tier (Chen Yudong 2004, Zou Yu 2004). 
 
3.2.1 Break indices tier 
 
Based on Cao Jianfen?s (1999, 2001) categories 
of prosodic hierarchy structure combined with 
the practical needs of broadcast speech, we iden-
tified five break levels (0-4): 0 indicates the si-
lence or the boundary of default internal sylla-
bles amidst the prosodic words. 1 stands for the 
boundaries of the prosodic words including the 
short breaks with silent pause and breaks with 
filled pause. The prosodic words are the funda-
mental prosodic units in broadcast speech. Sim-
ple prosodic words are composed of 1~3 sylla-
bles. Complex prosodic words normally contain 
5~9 syllables, e.g., ?Shang4hai3 he2zuo4 
zu3zhi1? (i.e. the Shanghai Cooperation Organi-
zation). Break level 2 designates the boundaries 
of the prosodic phrases, most of which are ap-
parent breaks with silent pause, and their patterns 
of pitch have also changed. Break level 3 repre-
sent the boundaries of intonational phrases, or 
the boundaries of sentences. Break level 4 stands 
for the boundaries of intonation groups, similar 
to the boundary of the entire piece of news in a 
news broadcast, or of a talker turn in dialogue. 
At indefinite boundaries, the code ?-? is added 
after the numbers. The labels of the break tier 
occurring times are shown in table 2:

hours annotated corpora

3.2.2 Stress indices tier 
 
Stress is a significant prosodic feature. In train-
ing materials for broadcast announcers, emphasis 
is laid on labeling the stress on the basis of the 
purpose of the utterance, the pattern and rhythm 
of stresses, and the changes of emotions. Zhang 
Song?s (1983) classification of nuclear stresses 
can be the guideline for broadcasting production 
and practice. However, there are some shortcom-
ings in his classifications, for instances, the 
vague hierarchies between the sentences and dis-
courses. This gets in the way of the formal de-
scription of the stresses by the computers. Never-
theless, his theories on the judgment of primary 
and minor stresses (i.e. non-stresses, minor 
stresses, primary stresses etc.) have some refer-
ence value for stress annotations, because distin-
guishing the hierarchies of stress is a crucial 
practical problem for annotation. 
As to the problems with the hierarchies of 
stress, most of the experimental phonetics and 
speech processing researchers adopt Lin Mao-
can?s (2001, 2002) classifications of stress hier-
archies or some similar classifications. That is to 
say, the levels of stress include prosodic word 
stress, prosodic phrase stress, and sentence stress 
(or nuclear stress) in Chinese. According to real 
life broadcasting productions, this paper identi-
104
fies four categories of stresses in broadcast 
speech: the rhythm unit, the cross rhythm unit, 
the clause, and the discourse. Among them, the 
discourse stress often occurs at the place of an 
accented syllable, but they are relatively more 
important than the other sentence stresses. The 
labeling methods of all the ranks are listed as 
follows (Chen Yudong 2004): 
 
Table 3 the stress levels in the stress indices tier

Cross rhythm unit 2

1 .585 .09628
2 .790 .19405
3 .728 .24882
4 .821 .29456
 
Furthermore, Zhang Song's (1983) other crite-
ria for stress annotation (utterance purpose and 
emotion change), while perceptually important, 
are meta-linguistic or para-linguistic in character, 
and will therefore not be addressed in this paper. 
 
3.2.3 Intonation construction tier 
 
In line with Shen Jiong?s view about intonation 
(Shen Jiong 1994), we found that the intonation 
construction tier is an important component of 
the annotation of discourses (Chen Yudong 
2004). It can display the changes of sentence in-
tonation structures. The annotation of the intona-
tion construction is mainly to label the relation-
ship of other syllables to the nuclear stress apart 
from prehead, dissociation etc. For example: 
 
Table 5 the labels of the intonation construction 
tier occurring in 4 hours annotated corpora 
Labels Description Occurrence 
P Prehead 794 
H Head 2980 
N Nucleus 2400 
T Tail 1600 
W Weak in stress 2321 
D Dissociation 527 
Top Topic 269 
Conj Conjunction 87 
 
A sentence can have one nuclear stress, or 
multiple nuclear stresses. 
Single nuclear stress: representing the fore-
and-aft places of the nuclear stress, the steepness 
of nuclear stress, and the length of nuclear stress. 
Examples are listed as follows: 
P-H-N-T;  
P-H-H-N;  
... ... 
Among the above examples, long nuclear 
splitting type ?H-N-T-H-N?-T?, with the features 
of multi-nuclear ?H-N1-T-H-N2-T? is greatly 
similar to multi-nuclear. However, ?H-N-T-H-
N?-T? differs from multi-nuclear in its dependent 
grammar unit.  
Multi-nuclear stress: The two or more nuclear 
stresses in a multi-nuclear sentence take the pat-
terns of like independent sentence intonation 
constructions, each with its own nucleus, pre-
ceded by a head and optional prehead, and fol-
lowed by a tail. In other words, these relatively 
independent patterns already have the features of 
relatively independent intonation constructions, 
with the apparent features of ?prehead, head, and 
nuclear ending?. This kind of nuclear stress often 
occurs in relatively longer and more complex 
constructions. Intonation constructions can be 
labeled separately. A case in point is the contras-
tive sentence ?zai4 wen3 ding4 de0 ji1 chu3 
shang0, qu3 de2 bi3 jiao4 gao1 su4 de0 fa1 
zhan3? (i.e. It got a comparative high-speed de-
velopment on the stable conditions) that can be 
annotated as ?H-N1-T, H-N2-T?. For example: 
 
 
Figure 3 the contrastive sentence ?zai4 wen3 
ding4 de0 ji1 chu3 shang0, qu3 de2 bi3 jiao4 
gao1 su4 de0 fa1 zhan3?(?????????
????????) 
 
3.3 Other items of annotation 
Some spoken language corpus can have some 
additional annotation information. For example, 
turn talking, paralinguistic and non-linguistic 
105
information (e.g. spot, background music, cough-
ing, sobbing and sneezing) and some hosts? ac-
cents (e.g. Shanghai accent) can be annotated in 
talk show corpus. There are 82 times of spot and 
31 times of background music in 4 hours anno-
tated data. Furthermore, some .wav files, .mpeg 
files can be annotated together for discourse 
analysis. 
4 Distribution of annotated items 
We conducted a statistic analysis of some an-
notated items using 4 hours of annotated data in 
our corpus. 
The syllables (initials and finals) of the 20 top 
frequent occurring are given in Table 6. In addi-
tion to this, the duration and variance distribution 
for them are calculation shown as follows.

The occurrence distribution of initial, final, 
and tone are calculated. These are shown in table 
7, 8 and 9 respectively. 
We also measured the mean duration and F0 
of each tone in three speaking styles are listed in 
Table 10 and 11.

min. of T4 113.39 120.98 175.49
range of T4 50.57 49.09 34.37
 
To summarize, we conclude that the mean du-
ration of tones of reading style is longer than that 
of presentation style; that of talk style is the 
shortest among three styles. As for the F0 of each 
106
tone, the F0 and pitch range of presentation style 
is high and has big fluctuation; that of talk style 
is high and has small fluctuation. However, the 
F0 of tone 3 of presentation style is lower than 
that of reading and talk styles. 
5 Further study 
The broadcast audio and video bimodal corpus1 
is a presentation art-oriented corpus with radio 
and television news as its basis. This paper 
probes the development and compilation of 
broadcast audio and video bimodal corpus. 
Firstly, on the collection of the corpus, what 
sort of audio and video corpus can represent the 
features of radio and television speech language? 
How can we auto-annotate the audio and video 
corpus? ...These are the problems that have al-
ways been bothering us. 
Secondly, this corpus can be a platform for 
further research into non-accented or accented 
syllables, intonation construction, the prosodic 
functions of paragraphs and discourses, the emo-
tions of speech, and genre styles. 
Finally, we can statistically analyze the spec-
tral and prosodic characteristics of various speak-
ing styles by the corpora, such as presentation, 
reading and talk. All speaking styles would be 
synthesized based on the analysis results. This is 
also work for the future.
