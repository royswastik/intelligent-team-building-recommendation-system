JAVOX provides a mechanism for the development 
of spoken-language systems from existing desktop 
applications. We present an architecture that al- 
lows existing Java 1 programs to be speech-enabled 
with no source-code modification, through the use 
of reflection and automatic modification to the ap- 
plication's compiled code. The grammars used in 
JAvox are based on the Java Speech Grammar For- 
mat (JSGF); JAVOX grammars have an additional 
semantic omponent based on our JAVOX Script- 
ing Language (JSL). JAVOX has been successfully 
demonstrated onreal-world applications. 
1 Overv iew 
JAVOX is an implemented set of tools that allows 
software developers to speech-enable existing appli- 
cations. The process requires no changes to the 
program's source code: Speech capacity is plugged- 
in to the existing code by modifying the compiled 
program as it loads. JAVOX is intended to provide 
similar functionality o that usually associated with 
menus and mouse actions in graphical user interfaces 
(GUIs). It is completely programmable - develop- 
ers can provide a speech interface to whatever func- 
tionality they desire. J ivox  has been successfully 
demonstrated with several GUI-based applications. 
Previous ystems to assist in the development of
spoken-langnage systems (SLSs) have focused on 
building stand-alone, customized applications, uch 
as (Sutton et al, 1996) and (Pargellis et al, 1999). 
The goal of the JAVOX toolkit is to speech-enable 
traditional desktop applications - this is similar to 
the goals of the MELISSA project (Schmidt et al, 
1998). It is intended to both speed the develop- 
ment of SLSs and to localize the speech-specific code 
within the application. JAVOX allows developers to 
add speech interfaces to applications at the end of 
the development process; SLSs no longer need to be 
built from the ground up. 
We will briefly present an overview of how JAVOX 
works, including its major modules. First, we 
1Java and Java Speech are registered trademarks of Sun 
Microsystems, Inc. 
will examine TRANSLATOR, the implemented JAVOX 
natural anguage processing (NLP) component; its 
role is to translate from natural language utterances 
to the JhVOX Scripting Language (JSL). Next, we 
will discuss JSL in conjunction with a discussion of 
EXECUTER, the interface between JAVOX and the 
application. We will explain the JhvOX infrastruc- 
ture and its current implementation in Java. In 
conclusion, we will discuss the current state of the 
project and where it is going. 
2 Bas ic  Operat ion  
J ivox can be used as the sole location of NLP for 
an application; the application is written as a non- 
speech-enabled program and JhvOX adds the speech 
capability. The current implementation is written 
in Java and works with Java programs. The linkage 
between the application program and JhvOX is cre- 
ated by modifying - at load time - all constructors in 
the application to register new objects with JAVOX. 
For this reason, the application's source code does 
not need any modification to enable JAVOX. A thor- 
ough discussion of this technique ispresented in Sec- 
tion 4. The schematic n Figure 1 shows a high-level 
overview of the JAVOX architecture. 
Issuing a voice command begins with a user ut- 
terance, which the speech recognizer processes and 
passes to the NLP component, TRANSLATOR. We 
are using the IBM implementation f Sun's Java 
Speech application program interface (API) (Sun 
Microsystems, Inc., 1998) in conjunction with IBM's 
VIAVOICE. The job of TRANSLATOR - or a differ- 
ent module conforming to its API - is to translate 
the utterance into a form that represents he corre- 
sponding program actions. The current implemen- 
tation of TRANSLATOR uses a context-free grammar, 
with each rule carrying an optional JSL fragment. 
A typical bottom-up arser processes utterances and 
a complete JSL program results. The resulting JSL 
is forwarded to EXECUTER, where the JSL code is 
executed. For example, in a hypothetical banking 
application, the utterance add $100 to the account 
might be translated into the JSL command: 
myBalance = myBa lance  + i00;

Figure 1: Schematic of the JAVOX architecture. 
The job of EXECUTER - or a different module that 
conforms to EXECUTER'S API - is to execute and 
monitor upcalls into the running application. The 
upcalls are the actual functions that would be made 
by the appropriate mouse clicks or menu selections 
had the user not used speech. For this reason, we are 
currently concentrating our efforts on event-driven 
programs, the class of most GUI applications. Their 
structure is usually amenable to this approach. Our 
implementation f EXECUTER performs the upcalls 
by interpreting and executing JSL, though the tech- 
nology could be used with systems other than JSL. 
In the banking example, EXECUTER would identify 
the myBalemce variable and increment i by $100. 
The main JAVOX components, TRANSLATOR and 
EXECUTER, are written to flexible APIs. Develop- 
ers may choose to use their own custom components 
instead of these two. Those who want a different 
NLP scheme can implement a different version of 
TRANSLATOR and - as long as it outputs JSL - 
still use EXECUTER. Conversely, those who want a 
different scripting system can replace JSL and still 
use TRANSLATOR and even EXECUTER's low-level 
infrastructure. 
3 Javox  Grammars  
The JAVOX infrastructure is not tied to any par- 
ticular NLP method; in fact, the JAVOX grammar 
system is the second NLP implementation we have 
used. It is presented here because it is straightfor- 
ward, easy to implement, and surprisingly powerful. 
JAVOX grammars axe based on Sun's Java Speech 
Grammar Format (JSGF) (Sun Microsystems, Inc., 
1998). JSGF is a rule-based, speech-recognition 
grammar, designed to specify acceptable input to 
a recognizer. In JAVOX grammars, each JSGF  rule 
may be augmented with a fragment of JAVOX Script- 
ing Language code - we refer to JAVOX grammars as 
scriptable grammars. The result of parsing an utter- 
ance with a JAVOX grammar is a complete piece of 
JSL code, which is then interpreted to perform the 
action specified by the user. 
The process of speech-enabling an application in 
JAVOX consists of writing a grammar that con- 
tains the language to be used and the correspond- 
ing actions to be performed. Building on top of 
3SGF means - in many cases - only one file is 
needed to contain all application-specific informa- 
tion. JSL-specific code is automatically stripped 
from the grammar at runtime, leaving an ordinary 
JSGF grammar. This JSGF grammar is sent to a 
Java-Speech-compliant recognizer as its input gram- 
mar. In the current Java implementation, each Java 
source file (Foo. java) can have an associated JAVOX 
grammar file (Foo. gram) that contains all the infor- 
mation needed to speak to the application. Encap- 
sulating all natural anguage information in one file 
also means that porting the application to different 
languages i  far easier than in most SLSs. 
3.1 Ser ip tab le  Grammars  
Since JSGF grammars are primarily speech- 
recognition grammars, they lack the ability to en- 
code semantic information. They only possess a lim- 
ited tag mechanism. Tags allow the recognizer to 
output a canonical representation f the utterance 
instead of the recognition verbatim. For example, 
106 
publ ic  <ACTION> = move \[the\] <PART> <DIR>; 
publ ic  <PART> = eyes; 
publ ic  <PART> = ( cap I hat ); 
publ ic  <DIR> = up; 
publ ic  <DIR> = down; 
Grammar 1: A JSGF fragment from the Mr. Potato Head domain. 
the tag rm may be the output from both delete the 
file and remove it. 
Tags are not implemented in JAVOX grammars; 
instead, we augment he rules of JSGF with frag- 
ments of a scripting language, which contains much 
richer semantic information than is possible with 
tags. TRANSLATOR receives the raw utterance from 
the recognizer and translates it into the appropriate 
semantic representation. JAvox grammars do not 
mandate the syntax of the additional semantic por- 
tion. Though JSL is presented here, TRANSLATOR 
has been used to form Prolog predicates and Visual 
Basic fragments. 
JSGF rules can be explicitly made public or are 
implicitly private. Public rules can be imported by 
other grammars and can serve as the result of a 
recognition; a private rule can be used in a recog- 
nition, but cannot be the sole result. The five rules 
in Grammar 1 are from a JSGF-only grammar frag- 
ment from the Mr. Potato Head 2 domain (discussed 
later). Grammar 1 allows eight sentences, uch as 
move the eyes up, move the eyes down, move the 
cap up, move the cap down, and move cap up. Rule 
names are valid Java identifiers enclosed within an- 
gle brackets; the left-hand side (LHS) is everything 
to the left of the equality sign and the right-hand side 
(RHS) is everything to the right. JAVOX grammars 
include the standard constructs available in JSGF, 
these include: 
Impor ts  Any grammar file can be imported into 
other grammar files, though only public rules 
are exported. This allows for the creation 
of grammar libraries. When using JSL, Java 
classes can also be imported. 
Comments Grammars can be documented using 
Java comments: single-line comments ( / / )  and 
delimited ones (/* until */). 
Parenthesis Precedence can be modified with 
parentheses. 
A l te rnat ives  A vertical bar ( I ) can be used to sep- 
arate alternative elements, as in the <PART> rule 
of Grammar 1. 
Opt iona ls  Optional elements are enclosed within 
brackets (\[ and \] ), such as the in Grammar l's 
<ACTION> rule. 
2Mr. Potato Head is a registered trademark ofHasbro, Inc. 
K leene  Star  Operator  A postfix Kleene star (*) 
operator can be used to indicate that the pre- 
ceding element may occur zero or more times. 
P lus  Operator  A similar operator to indicate that 
an element may appear one or more times. 
A grammar's rules may be organized however the 
developer wishes. Some may choose to have one 
rule per utterance, while others may divide rules to 
the parts-of-speech level or group them by semantic 
value. In practice, we tend to write rules grouped by 
semantic value for nouns and verbs and at the parts- 
of-speech level for function words. Grammar 2shows 
the Mr. Potato Head grammar augmented with JSL 
fragments. 
The semantic omponent of each rule is separated 
from the RHS by a colon and delimited with a brace 
and colon ({: until :}). Using Grammar 2, the 
parse and translation for Move the cap up is shown 
in Figure 2. 
Each rule may have either one semantic fragment 
or any number of named fields. A single fragment 
is sufficient when there is a one-to-one correlation 
between a lexical item and its representation in the 
program. Occasionally, a single lexical item may re- 
quire several components to adequately express its 
meaning within a program. In Grammar 2, there 
is a one-to-one correlation between the direction of 
movement and the s l ideUp and s l ideDown func- 
tions in the <DIR> rules. These functions can also 
written as a single s l ide  function, with the direction 
of the movement given by two parametric variables 
(cos and sin). In this situation, the direction rule 
(<DIR.}/F>) needs to be expressed with two values, 
each known as a named field. The word up may be 
represented by the named fields cos and sin,  with 
the values 0 and 1 respectively. 
Another issue in JSL - which does not arise in the 
syntax-only JSGF - is the need to uniquely identify 
multiple sub-rules of the same type, when they oc- 
cur in the same rule. For example, in a geometry 
grammar, two <POINT>s may be needed in a rule to 
declare a <LINE>, as in: 
public <LINE> = make a line from 
<POINT> to <POINT> : ... 
Uniquely numbering the sub-rules eliminates the 
ambiguity as to which <POINT> is which. Numbering

3.2 Javox Scr ipt ing Language ( JSL)  
The JAVOX Scripting Language (JSL) is a stand- 
alone programming language, developed for use with 
the JAVOX infrastructure. JSL can be used to ma- 
nipulate a running Java program and can be thought 
of as an application-independent macro language. 
The EXECUTER module interprets JSL and per- 
forms the specified actions. The specifics of JSL 
are not important o understanding JAVOX; for this 
reason, only a brief summary is presented here. 
JSL can read of modify the contents of an ob- 
ject's fields (data members) and can execute m th- 
ods (member functions) on objects. Unlike Java, 
JSL is loosely-typed: Type checking is not done un- 
til a given method is executed. JSL has its own 
variables, which can hold objects from the host ap- 
plication; a JSL variable can store an object of 
any type and no casting is required. JSL supports 
Java's primitive types, Java's reference types (ob- 
jects), and Lisp-like lists. Though JSL does support 
3This representation is motivated by the grammars of 
(Hipp, 1992). 
Java's primitive types, they are converted into their 
reference-type equivalent. For example, an integer 
is stored as a java. lang. Integer and is converted 
back to an integer when needed. 
JSL has the standard control flow mechanisms 
found in most conventional programming languages, 
including if-else, for and while loops. With the 
exception of the evaluation of their boolean expres- 
sions, these constructs follow the syntax and behav- 
ior of their Java counterparts. Java requires that 
if-else conditions and loop termination criteria be 
a boolean value. JSL conditionals are more flexi- 
ble; in addition to booleans, it evaluates non-empty 
strings as true, empty strings as false, non-zero val- 
ues as true, zero as false, non-null objects as true, 
and nu l l  as false. 
In addition to Java's control f ow mechanisms, 
JSL also supports fo reach  loops, similar to those 
found in Perl. These loops iterate over both JSL 
lists and members of java.util.List, executing 
the associated code block on each item. JSL lists 
are often constructed by recursive rules in order to 
handle conjunctions, as seen in Section 5. 
4 Infrastructure 
The JAVOX infrastructure has been designed to com- 
pletely separate NLP  code from the application's 
code. The application still can be run without 
JAVOX, as a typical, non-speech-enabled program 
- it is only speech-enabled when run with JAVOX. 
108 
From the application's perspective, JAVOX operates 
at the systems-level and sits between the applica- 
tion and the operating system (virtual machine), as 
shown in Figure 1. TRANSLATOR interfaces with the 
speech recognizer and performs all necessary NLP. 
EXECUTER interfaces directly with the application 
and performs upcalls into the running program. 
Java has two key features that make it an ideal 
test platform for our experimental implementation: 
reflection and a redefineable loading scheme. Re- 
flection provides a running program the ability to 
inspect itself, sometimes called introspection. Ob- 
jects can determine their parent classes; every 
class is itself an object in Java (an instance of 
j ava.lang.Class). Methods, fields, constructors, 
and all class attributes can be obtained from a Class 
object. So, given an object, reflection can determine 
its class; given a class, reflection can find its meth- 
ods and fields. JAVOX uses reflection to (1) map 
from the JSL-textual representation of an object 
to the actual instance in the running program; (2) 
find the appropriate j ava.lang.reflect.Methods 
for an object/method-name combination; and (3) 
actually invoke the method, once all of its arguments 
are known. 
Reflection is very helpful in examining the appli- 
cation program's tructure; however, prior to using 
reflection, EXECUTER needs access to the objects in 
the running program. To obtain pointers to the ob- 
jects, JAVOX uses JOIE,  a load-time transformation 
tool (Cohen et al, 1998). JO IE  allows us to modify 
each application class as it is loaded into the virtual 
machine. The JAVOX transform adds code to every 
constructor in the application that registers the new 
object with Executer.  Conceptually, the following 
line is added to every constructor: 
Executer. register (this). 
This modification is done as the class is loaded, 
the compiled copy - on disk - is not changed. This 
allows the program to still be run without JhVOX, 
as a non-speech application. EXECUTER can  - once 
it has the registered objects - use reflection to ob- 
tain everything else it needs to perform the actions 
specified by the JSL. 
5 Example  
Our longest running test application has been a 
Mr. Potato Head program; that allows users to ma- 
nipulates a graphical representation of the classic 
children's toy. Its operations include those typically 
found in drawing programs, to include moving, recol- 
oring and hiding various pieces of Mr. Potato Head. 
Grammar 3 shows a portion of application's gram- 
mar needed to process the utterance Move the eyes 
and glasses up. The result of parsing this utterance 
is shown in Figure 3. 
Once TRANSLATOR has processed an utterance, it
forwards the resulting JSL fragment to EXECUTER. 
Figure 4 provides a reduced class diagram for the 
Mr. Potato Head application; the arrows correspond 
to the first iteration in the following trace. The 
following steps are performed as the JSL fragment 
from Figure 3 is interpreted: 
1. A new variable - local to EXECUTER - named 
$ i te r  is created. Any previously-declared vari- 
able with the same name is destroyed. 
2. The fo reach  loop starts by initializing the 
loop variable to the first item in the list: 
Canvas.eyes0bj. This object's name consists 
of two parts; the steps to locate the actual in- 
stance in the application are: 
(a) The first part of the name, Canvas, is 
mapped to the only instance of the Canvas 
class in the context of this application. 
JAVOX has a reference to the instance be- 
cause it registered with EXECUTER when it 
was created, thanks to a JO IE  transforma- 
tion. 
(b) The second part of the name, eyes0bj,  is 
found through reflection. Every instance of 
Canvas has a field named eyes0bj of type 
BodyPaxt. This field is the eyes0bj for 
which we are looking. 
3. Once eyes0bj is located, the appropriate 
method must be found. We determine - 
through reflection - that there are two meth- 
ods in the BodyPart class with the name move, 
as seen in Figure 4. 
4. We next examine the two arguments and de- 
termine them to be both integers. Had the ar- 
guments been objects, fields, or other method 
calls, this entire procedure would be done re- 
cursively on each. 
5. We examine each possible method and deter- 
mine that we need the one with two integer 
arguments, not the one taking a single Point  
argument. 
6. Now that we have the object, the method, and 
the arguments, the upcall is made and the 
method is executed in the application. The re- 
sult is that Mr. Potato Head's eyes move up on 
the screen. 
7. This process is repeated for glass0bj and the 
loop terminates. 
After this process, both the eyes and glasses have 
moved up 20 units and Executer waits for additional 
input. The application continues to accept mouse 
and keyboard commands, just as it would without 
speech.

6 Discuss ion and Future Work 
In practice, building a JAvox-based, speech in- 
terface - for limited-functionality applications - is 
straightforward and reasonably quick. To date, we 
have used three diverse applications as our test plat- 
forms. Speech-enabling the last of these, an image 
manipulation program, took little more than one 
person-day. Though these applications have been 
small; we are beginning to explore JAvOX's scala- 
bility to larger applications. We are also develop- 
ing a library of JAVOX grammars for use with the 
standard Java classes. This resource will shorten 
development times even more; especially compared 
to building a SLS from the ground up. 
One of the existing challenges is to work with 
applications consisting entirely of dynamic objects, 
those that cannot be identified at load time. Some 
typical dynamic-object applications are drawing 
programs or presentation software; in both cases, 
the user creates the interesting objects during run- 
time. We have implemented a system in JSL which 
allows objects to be filtered based on an attribute, 
such as color in the utterance: Move the blue square. 
In situations where there is a one-to-one correla- 
tion between a lexical item in the grammar and an 
object in the program, it is often the case that the 
lexical item is very similar to the element's identi- 
fier. It is quite often the same word or a direct syn- 
onym. Since JAVOX is primarily performing upcalls 
based on existing functions within the program, it 
also can be predicted what type of objects will co- 
occur in utterances. In the Mr. Potato Head applio

cation, we can assume that objects representing a 
Point or integers will occur when the user speaks 
of moving a BodyPart. We are developing a system 
to exploit hese characteristics to automatically gen- 
erate JAVOX grammars from an application's com- 
piled code. The automatically-generated grammars 
are intended to serve as a starting point for develop- 
ers - though they may certainly require some hand 
crafting. Our current, grammar-generation oolas- 
sumes the program is written with Java's standard 
naming conventions. It is imaginable that additional 
data sources - such as a sample corpus - will al- 
low us to more accurately generate grammars for an 
application. Though in its infancy, we believe this 
approach olds vast potential for SLS development. 
7 Conc lus ion  
JAVOX provides a fast and flexible method to add a 
speech-interface to existing Java applications. The 
application program requires no source-code modifi- 
cation: The JAVOX infrastructure provides all NLP 
capabilities. We have implemented a grammar and 
scripting system that is straightforward enough that 
inexperienced developers and those unfamiliar with 
NLP can learn it quickly. We have demonstrated the 
technology on several programs and are commencing 
work on more ambitious applications. The current 
implementation f JAVOX is available for download
