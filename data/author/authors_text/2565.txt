Abstract
Test collections are essential to evaluate
Information Retrieval (IR) systems. The
relevance assessment set has been recog-
nized as the key bottleneck in test col-
lection building, especially on very large
sized document collections. This paper
addresses the problem of efficiently se-
lecting documents to be included in the
assessment set. We will show how ma-
chine learning techniques can fit this task.
This leads to smaller pools than tradi-
tional round robin pooling, thus reduces
significantly the manual assessment work-
load. Experimental results on TREC col-
lections1 consistently demonstrate the ef-
fectiveness of our approach according to
different evaluation criteria.
1 Introduction
The effectiveness of retrieval systems is often justi-
fied by benchmark test collections. A standard test
collection consists of lots of documents, a set of in-
formation needs, called topics and human judgment
about the relevance status of each document for a
topic. Nowadays, it is relatively easy to gather huge
set of millions of documents and hundreds of topics.
The key obstacle for forming large sized test col-
lections lies therefore in the topic assessment pro-
cedure. Assessing the whole document sets is un-
feasible, even for small sized collection of 800,000
documents (Voorhees and Harman, 1999). In order
to keep the assessment process practical, one often
1http://trec.nist.gov
selects a certain number of documents for judgment.
This is called (document) pooling and the outcome
the pool or the qrels (query relevance set). The col-
lected documents are then judged by humans, doc-
uments outside the pool are assumed non relevant.
A representative pool is therefore essential to the
whole evaluation process.
This paper proposes a method to form the assess-
ment set with the support of machine learning algo-
rithms. Based on relevance judgments of relatively
shallow pools, a ranking algorithm will attempt to
give priority for relevant documents so that the as-
sessment set can be fixed at a feasible size without
skewing the system evaluation result. The judgment
process is indeed kept as much subjective-free as
possible: the first relevance feeback step is designed
appropriately so that the assessor cannot give any
bias towards any particular rank or any system, the
learning process is completely transparent to the as-
sessors and parameters of the ranking function are
collection-tailored rather than exported from previ-
ous collections.
The method will then be evaluated on TREC
ad-hoc collections. Results from our comprehensive
experiment confirm that the qrels generated by our
method are much more representative than those of
the same size by the TREC method. The outcome
qrels is substantially smaller, so much cheaper to
produce than the official TREC qrels, yet their con-
clusions about system effectiveness are quite com-
patible.
The remaining of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. We review related work in Section 2. Sec-
tion 3 presents the general framework of apply-
ing machine learning techniques to forming test
collections. We also give a brief introduction
399
about RankBoost (Freund et al, 2003) and Rank-
ing SVM (Joachims, 2002b), the two learning algo-
rithms used in our experiment. Section 4 introduces
data sets and experimental setup. Section 5 is ded-
icated to present experimental results according to
different evaluation criteria. Precisely, Section 5.1
shows the capacity of small pools on identifying rel-
evant documents and Section 5.2 illustrates their im-
pact on system comparison; Section 5.3 presents sta-
tistical validation tests. We conclude and discuss
perspectives in Section 6.
2 Related work
2.1 TREC methodology
Since the seminal work of test collection forming
in 1975 (Sparck Jones and Van Rijsbergen, 1975),
pooling has been outlined as the main approach
to form the assessment set. The simple solution
of round robin pooling from different systems pro-
posed in that report has been adopted in most exist-
ing IR evaluation forums such as TREC, CLEF2 or
NTCIR3. For convenience, we will denote that strat-
egy as TREC-style pooling. To have the assessment
set, from submissions (restricted length L = 1000
for most TREC tracks), only n top documents per
submission are pooled. Despite different technical
tricks to control the final pool size such as gathering
only principal runs or reducing the value of n, the
assessment procedure is still quite time-consuming.
In TREC 8 ad-hoc track, for example, despite lim-
iting the pool depth n at 100 and gathering only 71
of 129 submissions, each assessor has to work with
approximately 1737 documents per topic (precisely,
between 1046 and 2992 documents). Assuming that
it takes on average 30 seconds to read and judge a
document, the whole judgment procedure for this
topic set can therefore only terminate after a round-
the-clock month. Meanwhile, a simple analysis on
the ad-hoc collections from TREC-3 to TREC-8 re-
vealed that there are on average 94% documents
judged as non relevant. Since most of existing ef-
fectiveness measures do not take into account these
non relevant documents, it would be bettter to not
waste effort on judging non relevant documents pro-
vided that the quality of test collections is always
2http://www.clef-campaign.org/
3http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/
conserved. Several advanced pool sampling meth-
ods have been proposed but due to some common
drawbacks, none of them has been used in practice.
2.2 Topic adaptive pooling
Zobel (Zobel, 1998) forms the shallow pools accord-
ing to the TREC methodology. When there are
enough judged documents (up to the set of 30 top
documents per run in his experiment), an extrapo-
lation function will then be estimated to predict the
number of unpooled relevant documents. The idea
is to judge more documents for topics that have high
potential to have relevant documents else. Carterette
and Allan (Carterette and Allan, 2005) have recently
replaced that extrapolation function by statistical
tests to distinguish runs. This method produced in-
teresting empirical outcomes on TREC ad-hoc col-
lections, lack however a sound theoretical basis and
is clearly of very high complexity due to iterative
statistical tests of every run pairs. Furthermore, this
incremental/online pooling approach raises a major
concern about the unbiasness requirement from the
human judgment as the assessors know well that
documents come later are of lower ranks, thus of
lower relevance possibility.
2.3 System adaptive pooling
Cormack et al (Cormack et al, 1998) propose the
so-called Move-To-Front (MTF) heuristic to give
priority for documents based on the correspond-
ing system performance. In their experiment,
the latter factor has been simply the number of
non relevant documents this system has intro-
duced to the pool since the last relevant document.
Aslam et al (Aslam et al, 2003) formulate this pri-
ority rule by adopting an online learning algorithm
called Hedged (Freund and Schapire, 1997).
Our method relies on this idea of pushing ahead
relevant documents by weighting retrieval systems.
There are however two major differences. Whilst
all aforementioned proposals favor online paradigm
with a series of human interaction rounds, our
method works in batch mode. We believe that the
latter is more suitable for this task since it elimi-
nates as much as possible the bias introduced by
human assessor towards any document. Moreover,
the batch mode enables us to exploit intuitively the
inter-topic relationship what is not the case of on-
400
line paradigm. The second difference lies in the way
of estimating the ranking function. It is widely ac-
cepted that machine learning techniques can deliver
more reliable model on previously unseen data given
much less training instances than any classical statis-
tical techniques or expert rules can.
2.4 Generate pseudo assessment set
Several evaluation methodologies, especially for
web search engines, have been proposed to evaluate
systems without relevance judgment. These propos-
als can be grouped into two main categories. The
first (Soboroff et al, 2001; Wu and Crestani, 2003;
Nuray and Can, 2006) exploits internal information
of submissions. The second (Can et al, 2004;
Joachims, 2002a; Beitzel et al, 2003) benefits ex-
ternal resources such as document and query con-
tent, or those of web environment. We skip the sec-
ond category since these resources are not available
in generic situations.
Soboroff et al (Soboroff et al, 2001) sam-
ple documents of a shallow pool (top ten
documents returned by retrieval systems)
based on statistics from past qrels. Wu and
Crestani (Wu and Crestani, 2003), Nuray and Can
(Nuray and Can, 2006) adopt metasearch strategies
on document position. A certain number of top out-
come documents will then be considered as relevant
without any human verification. Different voting
schemes have been tried in the two aformentioned
papers. Their empirical experiment illustrated how
the quality of these pseudo-qrels is sensible to the
chosen voting scheme and to other parameters such
as the pool depth or the diversity of systems used
for fusion. They also confirm that pseudo-qrels are
often unable to identify best systems.
In sum, the thorough literature review confirmed
the importance of relevance assessment sets in IR
evaluation yet the lack of an appropriate solution to
have a reliable set given a moderate amount of judg-
ment resource.
3 Machine learning based Pooling
3.1 General framework
Let M denote the topic set size available for the
training purpose, N the number of participating sys-
tems, k1 the pool depth to get the training data from
any participating system and K the final pool size.
The training process consists of two main steps.
Firstly, for each training topic, k1 first documents
of all N systems are gathered and the assessors are
asked to assess all of these documents. Let T denote
the outcome of this assessing step on all M topics.
From the information of T , a function f will then be
learned which assigns to each document a value cor-
responding to its relevance degree for a given query.
At the usage time, for each given topic, the whole
retrieved list of N systems will be fused. These doc-
uments will then be sorted in the decreasing order of
their values according to f and the K top documents
will be sent to the assessor for judgment. This last
set of judgements will be the qrels used for the sys-
tem evaluation.
In the training framework, it is clear that the sec-
ond step plays the major role. An effective scoring
function can substantially save the workload at the
last assessment step. We will now focus on methods
for estimating such scoring function.
3.2 Document ranking principle
The scoring function f can be estimated in differ-
ent ways as seen in the last section. In this study,
we adopt the learning-to-rank paradigm for estimat-
ing this scoring function. The principle of document
ranking will be sketched in this section. The next
sub-section will introduce the two specific ranking
algorithms used in our experiment.
A ranking algorithm aims at estimating a function
which describes correctly all partial orders inside a
set of elements. An ideal ranking in information re-
trieval must be able to place all relevant documents
above non relevant ones for a given topic. The prob-
lem can be described as follows. For each topic, the
document collection is decomposed into two disjoint
sets S+ and S? for relevant (non relevant respec-
tively) documents, R and NR are their cardinality. A
ranking function H(d) assigns to each document d
of the document collection a score value. We seek
for a function H(d) so that the document ranking
generated from the scores respect the relevance rela-
tionship, that is any relevant document has a higher
score than any non relevant one. Let ?d ? d?? sig-
nify that d is ranked higher than d?. The learning
401
objective can therefore be stated as follows.
d+ ? d? ? H(d+) > H(d?),?(d+, d?) ? S+ ? S?
There are different ways to measure the ranking
error of a scoring function h. The natural criterion
might be the proportion of misordered pairs (a rele-
vant document is below a non relevant one) over the
total pair number R.NR. This criterion is an estimate
of the probability of misordering a pair P(d? ? d+).

scribes the importance of the pair in consideration,
it will be uniform
(
1
R.NR
)
if the information is un-
known.
In practice, we have to average RLoss over the
training topic set. This can be done by either macro-
averaging at topic level or micro-averaging at docu-
ment pair level. For presentation simplification, this
operation has been implicit.
3.3 Discriminative ranking algorithms
Since RLoss is neither continuous nor differentiable,
its direct use as a training criterion raises practical
difficulties. Also, in order to provide reliable predic-
tions on previously unseen data, the prediction error
of the learning function has to be bounded with a
significant confidence. For both practical and theo-
retical reasons, RLoss is then often approximated by
a smooth error function.
In this study, we will explore the per-
formance of two ranking algorithms, they
are RankBoost (Freund et al, 2003) and
Ranking SVM (Joachims, 2002b). As far as
we know, these algorithms are actually among a
few state-of-the-art ranking learning algorithms
whose convergence and generalization properties
have been theoretically proved (Freund et al, 2003;
Joachims, 2002b; Cle?menc?on et al, 2005).
3.3.1 RankBoost
RankBoost (aka RBoost) (Freund et al, 2003) re-
turns a scoring function for each document d by min-
imizing the following exponential upper bound of
the ranking error RLoss (Eq. (2)):
ELoss(H) =
?
(d+,d?)
D(d+, d?)eH(d?)?H(d+) (3)
This is an iterative algorithm like all other boosting
methods (Freund and Schapire, 1997). The global
ranking function of a document d is a linear combi-
nation of all base functions H(d) = ?Tt=1 ?tht(d). At
each iteration t, a new training data sample is gener-
ated by putting more weight D(., .) on difficult pairs
(d+, d?). A scoring function ht is proposed (it can
even be chosen among the features used to describe
documents) and the weight ?t is estimated in order
to minimize the ELoss at that iteration.
RBoost has virtues particularly fitting the pool-
ing task. First, it can operate on relative values.
Second, it does not impose any independence as-
sumption between combined systems. Finally, in
the case of binary relevance judgment which usu-
ally occurs in IR, there is an efficient implementa-
tion of RBoost whose complexity is linear in terms
of the training instance number (cf: the original
text (Freund et al, 2003)).
3.3.2 Ranking SVM
Ranking SVM (Joachims, 2002b), rSVM for
short, is a straightforward adaptation of the max-
margin principle (Vapnik, 2000) to pairwise object
ranking. The score function is often assumed to be
linear in some feature space, that is H(d) = wT?(d)
where w is the vector of weights to be estimated and
? is a feature mapping. The max-margin approach
minimizes the following approximation of RLoss:
rSVMLoss(H) = max
{
1 +
(
H(d?) ? H(d+)
)
, 0
}
(4)
for all pairs (d+, d?) while at the same time control-
ling the complexity of function space described via
the norm of vector w for generalization objective.
Notice that rSVM does not explicitly support rank
values as does RBoost. Nevertheless, we will see
later that the discriminative nature allows rSVM to
work quite well on features merely deduced from
rank values. Its behavior difference is in fact ignor-
able in comparison with RBoost.
4 Experimental setup
Our method is general enough to be applicable to
any ad-hoc retrieval information task where pooling
402
could be useful. In this paper, we will however fo-
cus on TREC traditional ad-hoc retrieval collections.
Experiments have been performed on the three cor-
pora TREC-6, TREC-7 and TREC-8. Statistics
about the number of runs, of judgments, of rele-
vant documents are shown in Tab. 1. Due to limit
of space, we will detail results on the TREC-8 case
and only mention the results on the two others.
#runs #judgments #rel. docs Depth-5
TREC 6 79 1445.4 92.2 144.3
TREC 7 103 1606.9 93.5 114.6
TREC 8 129 1736.6 94.6 143.4
Table 1: Information about three TREC ad-hoc col-
lections. The three last columns are averaged over
the topic set size (50 topics/collection).
Training data is gathered from the top five an-
swers of each run. The pool depth of five has been
arbitrarily chosen to have both sufficient training
data and to eliminate potential bias from assessors
towards a particular system or towards early iden-
tified answers while judging a shallow pool. Fur-
thermore, this training data set is large enough for
testing the ranking algorithm efficiency.
Each document is described by an N-dimensional
feature vector where N is the number of participat-
ing systems. The jth feature value for a document
is a function of its position in the retrieved list, ties
are arbitrary broken. A document at rank i is as-
signed a feature value of (L + 1 ? i) where L is the
TREC limit of submission run (L is usually set up at
1000). Documents outside submission runs receive
the zero feature value (i.e. it is assumed to be at rank
(L + 1)). For implementation speed, the input for
rSVM is further scaled down to the interval [0, 1].
Due to the small topic set size, we use a leave-
one-out training strategy: a model will be trained
for each topic by using judgments of all other top-
ics. The training data set size is presented in the last
column of Tab. 1. The workload for training dataset
does not exceed the effort for assessing 5 topics in
the full pool of TREC.
We employ SVMlight package4 for rSVM.
We adopt the efficient RBoost version for bi-
nary feedback and binary base functions ht
(cf. (Freund et al, 2003)), boosting is iterated 100
4http://svmlight.joachims.org
times and we impose positive weighting for all coef-
ficients ?t.
The non-interpolated average precision (MAP)
has been chosen to measure system perfor-
mance5. This metric has been shown to be
highly stable and reliable with both small
topic set size (Buckley and Voorhees, 2000)
and very large document collec-
tions (Hawking and Robertson, 2003).
RBoost and rSVM pools will be compared to the
TREC-style pools of the same size. We also include
?local MTF? (Cormack et al, 1998) in the experi-
ment. The ?global MTF? has been shown to slightly
outperform the local version in the aforementioned
paper. However, we believe that the global mode
is merely for demonstration but unlikely practical
of online judgment since it insists that all queries
are judged simultaneously with a strict synchroni-
sation among all assessors. Hereafter, for simplic-
ity, the TREC-style pool of the first n documents
retrieved by each submission will be denoted by
Depth-n, the equivalent pool (with the same aver-
age final pool size m over the topic set) produced by
RBoost, rSVM or MTF will be RBoost-m, rSVM-m
or MTF-m respectively. In all figures in the next sec-
tion, the abscissa denotes the pool size m and values
of n will be present along the Depth-n curve.
5 Experimental results
This section will examine small pools produced ei-
ther by the TREC method or by RBoost/rSVM/MTF
from two angles: their pooling performance and
their influence on system comparison result.
5.1 Identify relevant documents
Fig. 1 shows the ratio of relevant documents re-
trieved by different pooling methods (i.e. the re-
call). The curves obtained by RBoost and rSVM are
quite similar and much higher than that by TREC
methodology. The curve of MTF is in the middle
of RBoost/rSVM and Depth-n at the beginning and
then catches that of RBoost at the pools of about 600
documents.

5.2 Correlation of system rankings
Once the pool is obtained by a given method, the
assessor will give relevance judgment for all docu-
ments of that pool, called qrels for the outcome. This
qrels will be used as the ground truth to measure ef-
fectiveness of a retrieval system.

according to different qrels methods in comparison

The simplest way to compare different sys-
tems is to sort them by the decreasing effective-
ness values. The correlation of each two sys-
tem rankings will then be quantified through a
correlation statistic. In this study, we follow
TREC convention (Buckley and Voorhees, 2004;
Carterette and Allan, 2005), that is taking the 0.9
value of Kendall?s ? as the sufficient threshold to
conclude that the difference of two system rankings
is ignorable. We compare here the system ranking
obtained by the official TREC qrels with those by
Depth-n where n varies from 1 to 100. We then re-
place Depth-n by RBoost-m, rSVM-m and MTF-m.
The results are shown in Fig. 2 for TREC-8 and in
Tab. 2 for the 7 first pool depths. We observe from
the figure the similar order of pooling methods as
seen in the previous section. The MTF curve meets
those of RBoost and rSVM from qrels of more than
400 documents. The results obtained on the two col-
lections of TREC-6 and TREC-7 are in line with
those observed on TREC-8 (Tab. 2).
It is clear that system ranking correlation quan-
tified by any rank correlation statistics provides
necessary but not sufficient information about sys-
tem comparison. Ranking systems by their sam-
ple means is indeed the simplest way with at least
two implicit assumptions. First, runs have simi-
lar variances, this usually does not hold in practice
even after discarding poorest runs. Second, all run
swaps have the same importance without taking into
account their statistically significant difference and
their positions in the system ranking. In practice,
swap of adjacent systems does not make much sense
if they are not significantly different to each other
according to statstical tests. The next section will be
devoted to further statistical validations.
5.3 Statistical Validations
5.3.1 Significant difference detection
We register for a given qrels all system pairs
which are significantly different on the topic set. The
quality of a qrels can be measured by the similarity
of this significant difference detection in compari-
son with that obtained by the official TREC qrels.
We carry out the paired t-test for each pair of runs
with 95% significance level. The recall and the false
alarm rate of these detections are shown in Fig. 3. In
terms of recall, RBoost and rSVM qrels are much
more better than its TREC-style counterparts and
MTF is in the middle. In terms of false alarm rate,
there are some changes concerning rSVM and MTF.
Precisely, rSVM at small qrels of less than 100 doc-
uments is the best whilst that is MTF qrels of more
than 150 documents.
5.3.2 Tukey grouping
This multicomparison test6 aims to group runs
based on their statistical difference. We concentrate

particularly on the top group, called group A which
consists of runs on which there is not enough evi-
dence to conclude that they are statistically signifi-
cantly worse than the top run. In practice, this fig-
ure will be meaningful if it is around 10 (one often
says about the top 10 runs). It will however become
meaningless if the group A is too large, for exam-
ple contains more than half of systems in consider-
ation. Note that Tukey test relies on the assump-
tion of Equality of Variances. This requirement can
not be completely satisfied in practice, even after

some data transformation such as arcsine-root or us-
ing rank values.
The size of group A on TREC-8 collection is
shown in Fig. 4. We observe from that figure the
stability of the two curves of RBoost and rSVM, this
implies that the two qrels RBoost-35 and rSVM-35
which have both satisfied the 0.9 requirement of
Kendall?s ? can replace the official TREC qrels. The
effort saving is therefore a factor of 50 (if ignoring
the cost of training data set preparation) and of 10.5
otherwise. MTF needs qrels of at least 168 docu-
ments to produce comparable group A?s with that of
the official TREC qrels. The Depth-n pools how-
ever should not be recommended with less than 1000
documents in total (i.e. pooling more than 40 top
documents per run).
6 Conclusions and Discussion
This study has well illustrated that two algorithms of
RBoost and rSVM are quite suitable for qrels con-
struction task. The final qrels are not only small
enough to ask for human judgment but also result
in reliable conclusion about system effectiveness in
405
comparison with the counterpart of TREC method-
ology and that of MTF.
It is necessary to include other metasearch meth-
ods for further study. This will allow us to validate
not only the impact of the metasearch training prin-
ciple based on pairwise ranking error RLoss but also
the capacity of automatic feature selection of the two
ranking algorithms used in this paper.
This method needs to be further verified on chal-
lenging ad-hoc retrieval scenarios such as Terabyte,
Web Topic Distillation or Robust Tracks in TREC
context. The hardness of these scenarios involves
two main issues. First, the number of document
judged relevant varies largely across the whole topic
set. Second, some topics might even have no rele-
vant document in shallow pools. These matter any
statistical inference on shallow pools.
