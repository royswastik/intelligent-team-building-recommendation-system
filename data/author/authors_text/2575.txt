Abstract 
This paper reported our work on 
annotating Chinese texts with 
information structures derived from 
HowNet. An information structure 
consists of two components: HowNet 
definitions and dependency relations. It 
is the unit of representation of the 
meaning of texts. This work is part of a 
multi-sentential approach to Chinese 
text understanding. An overview of 
HowNet and information structure are 
described in this paper. 
1 Introduction 
Corpora are essential resources to any research 
in language ngineering. For Chinese, efforts in 
building large corpora started in the 90s. For 
instance, the PH corpus of 4 million Chinese 
characters with word boundary information was 
released in 1993 (Guo, 1993). The first version 
of the Sinica corpus of two millions words 
marked with word boundaries and parts-of- 
speech was released in 1995 (CKIP, 1995). In 
1996, a small corpus of 5266 distinct words 
(inclusive of punctuation marks) with a total 
occurrence frequency of 51870 was released (Yu 
et al, 1996). This corpus was derived from the 
Singapore Primary School Chinese Language 
Textbooks. It contained information on word 
boundaries, parts-of-speech and also syntactic 
structures. In 2000, two additional bracketed 
corpora have just been announced. The first one, 
the Chinese Penn Treebank, includes 100- 
thousand words (Xia et al, 2000). The second 
one, the Sinica Treebank, which is derived from 
the Sinica corpus, contains 38,725 sentences 
with 1000 of them released to the public 1 (CKIP, 
2000). 
The historical development of Chinese corpus 
construction has shown a consensus in 
incorporating more powerful linguistic 
structures into corpora. As noted by Marcus 
(1997), the more powerful inguistic structures 
will help in improving the accuracy of parsing. 
This is especially true to isolating language such 
as Chinese. However, there is very little work on 
annotating corpora with semantic information. 
To the best of our knowledge, there is only one 
report of this kind. The work by Lua 2 annotated 
340,000 words with semantic lass information 
as defined in a thesaurus of synonyms (Mei, 
1983). With the release of HowNet 3, a bilingual 
general knowledge base, Gan and Tham (1999) 
reported the first corpus of 30,000 words that 
was annotated with the general knowledge 
structure defined in HowNet. This paper 
reported an extension of the work in &an and 
Tham (1999) on the annotation of information 
structures in Chinese texts. In Section 2, an 
overview of HowNet is provided. Information 
structure and an illustration will be given in 
Section 3. 
2 An Overview of HowNet 
HowNet is a bilingual general knowledge-base 
describing relations between concepts and 
relations between the attributes of concepts. The 
latest version covers over 65,000 concepts in

Qiang; HowNet) 
85 
Chinese and close to 75,000 English equivalents. 
The relations include hyponymy, synonymy, 
antonymy, meronymy, attribute-host, material- 
product, converse, dynamic role and concept 
cooccurrence. The philosophy behind the design 
of HowNet is ' i ts ontological view that all 
physical and non-physical matters undergo a 
continual process of motion and change in a 
specific space and time. The motion and change 
are usually reflected by a change in state that in 
turn, is manifested by a change in value of some 
attributes. The top-most level of classification i  
HowNet thus includes: entity, event, attribute 
and attribute value. It is important o point out 
that the classification is derived in a bottom-up 
manner. First, a set of sememes, the most basic 
set of semantic units that are non-decomposable, 
is extracted from about 6,000 Chinese characters. 
This is feasible because ach Chinese character 
is monosyllabic and they are meaning-bearing. 
Similar sememes are grouped. The coverage of 
the set of sememes i tested against polysyllabic 
concepts to identify additional sememes. 
Eventually, a total of over 1,400 sememes are 
found and they are organized hierarchically. 
This is a closed set from which all concepts are 
defined. The bottom-up approach takes 
advantage of the fact that all concepts, either 
current or new, can be expressed using a 
combination of one or more existing Chinese 
characters. It is yet to f'md a new concept hat 
has to resort to the creation of a new Chinese 
character. Therefore, by deriving the set of 
sememes in a bottom-up fashion, it is believed 
that the set of sememes is stable and robust 
enough to describe all kinds of concepts, 
whether current or new. The fact that HowNet 
has verified this thesis over 65,000 concepts is a 
good proof of its robustness. 
2.1 Types of Relation 
The definition of a concept in HowNet expresses 
one or more of the following relations. 
2.1.1 Dynamic Role 
There are a total of 71 dynamic roles defined in 
HowNet. Dynamic role resembles case role in 
case grammar (Fillmore, 1968). However, it 
differs from case role in that it is concerned with 
all probable actants of an event and the roles 
they play in the event. The issue of whether 
these actants can be realized grammatically is
not its concern. For example, 
Concept(l): IJ~g~ (be a vegetarian for 
religious reasons) 
DEF=eatlI~, pat ient=vegetablel~,  
religionl~J~ 
At the syntactic level, "1~"  is an intransitive 
verb. According to case grammar, it has only 
one case role: agent. However, for this word, the 
patient is self-contained in its constituent (i.e. 
"~"  ). HowNet specifies this explicitly and 
indicates the category ('vegetable'4) of 
prototypical concepts which fills up this role. 
Another distinguishing feature of dynamic role 
is its use in defining concepts of 'entity" class. 
Concept(2): ~\[!~ (writing brush) 
DEF=Penlnkl~l~, *writel~ 
Through the use of the "*" pointer, the above 
definition states that the concept being defined 
(~!~)  is the instrument of the event type 
"write'. 
HowNet alo uses dynamic role to specify the 
attributes that a concept contains. For example, 
Concept(3): ~ : ~  (arise suddenly) 
DEF=happenl~Z~ :, manner=suddenly 
The definition of concept (3) specifies that the 
manner of the event is 'sudden'. 
2.L2 Hyponymy Relation 
The 'event' and 'entity' classes in HowNet are 
organized in a hierarchical manner. The parent 
class is a hypernym of its children classes. 
Details of the organization are available from the 
HowNet site and are therefore omitted here. 
2.1.3 Meronymy Relation 
Meronymy relation is expressed through the 
4 We use single-quote and italic to mark sememes 
in HowNet. 
86 
pointer "%" . For example, 
Concept (4): ~ . ~  (CPU) 
DEF=par t l~ ,  %computerl~J~, heartl,~, 
The class of the-concept " t~5~:~"  is 
'part'. It is a part of the class 'computer'. The 
function of the part " t : l~S I~"  is the 
'heart' of the whole 'computer'. 
2.1.4 Material.Product Relation 
Material-product relation is expressed through 
the pointer "?" . For example, 
Concept (5): ~ ,~ (knitting wool) 
DEF=matefialltf~t, ?c lo th ing l~ 
"~,~"  belongs to the class 'material'. It is a 
material for the product 'clothing'. 
2.1.5 Attribute-Host Relation 
Attribute-host relation is expressed by the 
pointer "&" . For example, 
Concept (6): ~--~ (face) 
DEF=attributelJ~, reputat ion l~,  
&humanl),., &organizationl~\]~,~ 
"~:-~:" is an attribute; in particular, it is about 
the attribute 'reputation'. The hosts could be 
'human' as well as 'organization'. 
2.1.6 Concept Co-occurrence Relation 
Some concept typically co-occurs with certain 
concept. For example, 
Concept (7): ~ : ~  (lawless person) 
DEF=humanl)~., fiercely, efimel~l~, 
#policel~, undesiredl~ 
The typical context where the concept "~-~ 
~t~"  is used involves the concept 'police'. 
This type of relation is expressed by the pointer 
3 Information Structures 
Dong (2000) uses the example "~_~l~: .~ 
\ [ \ ]  " (Narcotic drugs smuggling group) to 
illustrate what information structure is. 
Describing the structure of this phrase at the 
syntactic level, such as the analysis of Penn 
Treebank (Xue, 1999: 72-77), only reveals that it 
is a noun phrase with the head of "~.~\[\]" 
modified by a relative clause "~_~.h"  
which involves operator movement. At the 
semantic level of description, we would indicate 
that "~\ [ \ ] "  (group) is the agent of the event 
"~_~.L" (smuggle) and "~"  (Narcotic 
drugs) is the pat/ent of "~_~" (smuggle). 
The informaton structure of this example 
consists of two parts, the dependency relations 
and the HowNet definitions. The descriptions 
are as follows: 
Dependency ~ \[patient\] <--:~_~--\[agent\] ~\ [ \ ]  
relations: 
Definitions: ~:  medicinel~:jqe~J, ?addictivel~ 
~.L :  transportl~l_I~, manner= 
secretly, crimel~l~ 
~\[\]: communityl\[\]~ 
In this example, the descriptions specify that a 
'community" is an agent involved in a 
'transport' event transporting the patient 
"medicine'. Furthermore, the 'transport" event is 
a 'crime' and the manner is 'secret'. The 
'medicine' is a material of 'addictive' products. 
The arrow between two concepts is a 
dependency onnection with the concept pointed 
to by the arrow denoting the dependent and the 
concept at the other end as the governor. The 
name of the dependency relation is enclosed in a 
square bracket and it could appear at either the 
dependent orthe governor side. 
Currently, over 60 types of information structure 
have been defined. The pattern of information 
structure is specified in the following format: 
(sememe) \[DRel\] ~ \[DRel\] (sememe), where 
DRel means the name of a dependency relation. 
For the dependency relation to apply, the 
governor and the dependent must satisfy the 
requirement of the sememes. Table 1 shows a 
87 
subset of the information structures. Information 
structures are derived in a bottom-up fashion 
from analysing the mechanisms used in the 
composition of words. This approach is based on 
the insight that mechanisms used in word 
formation are also applicable to phrase and 
sentence construction i Chinese. For example, 
the type "(l l  ltime) 
levent) " applies to the formation of the 
following units at various levels of linguistic 
structure: 
word 
level: 
phrase 
level: 
sentence 
level: 
"ZF:.~--~I~" (afternoon nap) 
"~\ ] '~- '~W" (summer study) 
" :~  ~ <- ~ ~ ~ ~"  (long-time 
shortage of commodities) 
"1999~ 12 ~ 9 \[\] ~ \ ]  \ [ \ ]  <-'-~ ~3~ 
~"  (leaking occurs on Thursday, 
December 9, 1999) 
In the process of annotating the corpus, the 
coverage of information structure types at the 
phrase and sentence levels was evaluated and 
missing types are added. The new types arise 
mainly due to function words. For example, the 
type "(modalityl ~ ~)  \[modalityl ~ ~ \] <-- 
(~'f~:levent)" is due to the use of function 
words such as "~j~," (must) and "~-~"  
(must). These are words expressing the attitude 
of the speaker of an utterance towards an event. 
3.1 An example 
We annotated a subset of the Sinica corpus 
(version 3.0) of 30,000 words with information 
structures. The corpus includes 103 newspaper 
texts covering the crime domain. The annotation 
has been completed and is currently under 
verification. We expect to release the corpus and 
the annotation guideline at the end of this year. 
An example of our annotation is shown below 
and its information structures are shown in 
Figure 1 at the end of this paper. The difference 
between this work and the work reported in Gan 
and Tham (1999) lies in the addition of the 
dependency relations into the annotation. 
(1) "~-~ ~ ~f~ ~-~-~j 
Tainan county Xinhua police branch 
criminal group junior captain 
Lin Wenzheng yesterday afternoon 
raise gun suicide after, 
"After Lin Wenzbeng, a junior captain 
with the Criminal Investigation Depathuent 
of the Xinhua police branch of Tainan 
county, committed suicide by shooting 
himself yesterday afternoon," 
The hierarchical structure in Figure 1 is another 
way to represent the relation between governor 
and dependent, as illustrated in Figure 2. C1 
immediately dominates C2, indicating that C1 is 
the governor and C2 the dependent. The relation 
between them is either R1 or R2. R1 is located 
at the same level as C 1 and R2 is located at the 
same level as C2. These two possibilities could 
also be represented linearly as shown in (2). 
Conceptcl RelationR2Rl Concept\[c2 
Figure 2: Relations between concepts 
(2) Cl \[RI\] ---~ JR2\[ C2 
R2 between the two concepts C1 and C2 should 
be read as "C2 is the R2 of CI" . For example, 
"T~=" (afternoon) is the .//me of "~"  
(raise). R1 between C1 and C2 should be 
interpreted as "C1 is the RI of C2" . For 
example, the "time" between "~" (after) 
and "~\ ]~"  (suicide) should be interpreted 
as "'~t" is the t/me of "~ I~"

are provided in Table 2:

The structures inFigure 1 and Table 2 reveal the 
following information: 
(a) example (1) is about the time after a 
'suicide" event; 
(b) preceding the 'suicide' event is the event 
' raise'; 
(c) the time of the 'raise' event is "1~'I~"1 r 
q=" , the agent is " ;~k3~"  and the 
patient is a "weapon'; 
(d) the 'occupation' of "@~J~"  i s  "1~

importance and ";~hk3~J~" belongs to the 
'institution' "-~-,~-~-~lJ~l:~\[" ; 
(e) the location of the 'institution' "~-~J-~qJ 
~"  is at "~'~g~Jr~J6" 
This kind of representation e ables a computer 
to analyse texts at a deeper level of 
understanding. As an English and Chinese 
bilingual eornmon-sense knowledge system, 
HowNet can contribute much to better text 
understanding and machine translation (Dong 
1999). 
4 Conclusion 
The work reported here constitutes part of our 
efforts to develop a new strategy for Chinese 
text understanding. The strategy was proposed 
by Dong (1999). It starts with tagging each 
concept with the most probable HowNet 
def'mitions. The second step is to determine the 
information structures as described in this paper. 
The last step is to recover the implicit 
information structures from the surface 
information structures based on two additional 
knowledge sources: (i) relations between the 
event ypes as defined in HowNet; and (ii) rules 
governing the interplay of dynamic roles 
between event ypes. For example, the "suicide" 
event in example (1) does not mention its agent 
directly. The means of committing 'suicide' by 
'firing' is also implicit. The recovery of this 
information will be the main issues to be 
resolved at the final stage. In parallel with our 
annotation effort, we are also working on 
developing automatic algorithms for the 
disambiguation of HowNet definitions and the 
identification of information structures. The 
creation of the two additional knowledge bases 
will be our future plan.
