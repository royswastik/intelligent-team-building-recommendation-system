Abstract 
In this paper we compare two types of 
corpus, focusing on the lexical mnbiguity of 
each of them. The first corpns consists 
mainly of newspaper articles and Hterature 
excerpts, while the second belc)ngs to the 
medical domain. To conduct he study, we 
have used two different disambiguation 
tools. However, first of all, we must verify 
the performance of each system in its 
respective application domain. We then use 
these systems in order to assess and compare 
both the general ambiguity rate and the 
particularities of each domain. (mantitative 
results show that medical documents are 
lexically less ambiguous than tmrestrieted 
documents. Our conclusions show the 
importance of the application area in the 
design of NLP tools. 
Introduction and background 
Although some large-scale valuations carried 
out on unrestricted texts (Hersh 1998a, Spark- 
Jones 1999), and even on medical documents 
(Hersh 1998b), conclude in a quite critical way 
about using NLP tools for information retrieval, 
we believe that such tools are likely to solve 
some lexical ambiguity issues. We also believe 
that some special settings -particular to the 
application area- must be taken into account 
while developing such NLP tools. 
Let us recall two major problems while 
retrieving documents with NLP engines (Salton, 
1988): 
1-Expansion: the user is generally as interested 
in retrieving documents with exactly the same 
words, as in retrieving documents with 
semantically related words (synonyms, generics, 
specifics...). Thus, a query based on the word 
liver, should be able to retrieve documents 
containing words such as hepatic. This 
expansion process is usually thesaurus-based. 
The thesaurus can be built manually or 
automatically (as, for ex~ple,  in Nazarenko, 
1997). 
2-Disambiguation: a search based on tokens may 
retrieve irrelevant documents since tokens are 
often lexically ambiguous. Thus, face can refer 
to a body part, as a noun, or an action, as a verb. 
Finally, this latter problem may be split into two 
sub problems. The disambiguafion task can be 
based on parts-of-speech (POS) or word-sense 
(WS) information, but the chronological relation 
is still a discussion within the community. 
Although, the target of our work (Ruch and al., 
1999, Bouillon and al., 2000) is a free-grained 
semantic disambiguation f medical texts for IR 
purposes, we believe that the POS 
disambiguation is an important preliminary step. 
Therefore this paper focuses on POS tagging, 
and compares morpho-syntacfic lexical 
ambiguities (MSLA) in medical texts to MSLA 
in unrestricted corpora. 
Although the results of the study conform to 
preliminary naive expectations, the method is 
quite original I. Most of the comparative studies, 
dedicated to corpora, have addressed the 
problem by applying metrics on words entities 
or word pieces (as in studies working with n- 
I We do not claim to be pioneer in the domain, as 
others authors (Biber 1998, Folch and al., 2000) axe 
exploring similar metrics. However, it is interesting 
to notice that for these authors the adaptation fthe 
NLP tools has rarely been questioned in a technical 
point-of view, and in order to feed back the design of 
NLP systems.

gram strings), or on special sets of words (the 
indexing terms, see Salton, 1988) as in the 
space-vector model (see Kilgariff, 1996, for a 
survey of these methods), whereas the present 
paper attempts to compare corpora t a morpho- 
syntactic (MS) level 
1 Validating each tagger into its respective 
domain 
In order to conduct he comparative study, we 
used two different morphological analysers; 
each one has a specific lexicon tailored for its 
application field. The first system is specialised 
for tagging medical texts (Ruch and al., 2000), 
while the second is a general parser (based on 
FIPS, cf. Wehrli, 1992). 
For comparing lexical ambiguities on a minimal 
common base, the output of each morphological 
analyser is first mapped into its respective tagset 
(more than 300 fine-grained tags for FIPSTAG, 
and about 80 for the morpheme-based medical 
tagger). The tagsets are then converted into a 
subset of the medical tagger. FinaUy, about 50 
different items constitute this minimal common 
tagset (MCT), which will serve for comparing 
both corpora. 
We collected two different sets of documents o 
be tagged at a lexical level via the predefined 
MCT: this step provides a set of tags to every 
token. This set of tags may come from the 
lexicon or from the POS guesser. As we are 
using guessers, the empty set (or the tag for 
unknown tokens) is forbidden. However, first of 
all, it is necessary to verify the lexical coverage 
of each system for each corpus, as we need to be 
sure that the lexical ambiguities provided by 
each system are necessary and sufficient. 
The corpus of the unrestricted texts consists of 
16003 tokens: about one third of newspaper 
articles (Le Monde), one third of  literature 
excerpts (provided by the InaLF, 
http://www.inalf.fr), and a smaller third being 
mainly texts for children. Approximately a
quarter (3987 tokens) of  this corpus is used for 
evaluating FIPSTAG tagging results (the tool 
together with some explanations can be found at 
http://latl.unige.ch). In parallel, we chose three 
types of medical texts to make up the medical 
corpus: it represents 16024 tokens, with 3 equal 
thirds: discharge summaries, surgical reports, 
and laboratory or test results (in this case, tables 
were removed). Again, a regularly distributed 
quarter (4016) of this corpus is used for 
assessing the medical tagger. 
The test samples used for assessing the results of  
each tagger are annotated manually before 
measuring the performances, but in both cases 
we sometimes had to modify the word 
segmentation of  the test samples. This is 
particularly true for FIPSTAG, which handles 
several acceptable but unusual collocations 
(which gather more than one 'word'), as for 
example n avion (in Eng. by plane), which is 
considered as one lexical item, tagged as an 
adverb. For the lexical tagger we had to modify 
the "word' segmentation i the other direction 
(for tagging items smaller than 'words'), as 
morphemes were also tagged. Table 1 gives the 
results for FIPSTAG, and table 2 gives the 
results for the medical tagger. In the case of  the 
medical tagger, together with the error rate and 
the success rate, we provide results of  the 
residual ambiguity rate: the basic idea is that the 
system does not attempt to solve what it is not 
likely to solve well (cf. Ruch and al. 2000, a 
similar idea can be found in Silberztein 1997).

A comparison of the tagging scores (99.3 vs.

equivalent way in their respective application 
area  2. 
2 Out of curiosity, we ran each tagger on a small 
sample of the other domain. The tests were made 
without any adaptation. FIPSTAG made 27 errors in 
a medical sample of 849 tokens, i.e. an error rate of 
3.2%. The medical tagger made 18 errors in a general 
sample of 747 tokens, which means an error rate of 
2.4%. In the case of the medical tagger, 41 tokens

2 Morphological analysers, lexicons and 
guessers 
Lexical ambiguities have two origins: the 
lexicon, and the guessing stages :for unknown 
tokens. However, all the ambiguities considered 
in this study are strictly lexical, and so 
translation phenomena (Tesni6r'e 1959, and 
Paroubek 1997) are not considered \]here. 
2.1 Medical lexicon 
The medical lexicon is tailored to biomedical 
texts, thus, with about 20000 lexemes, it covers 
exhaustively ICD-10. The biomedical language 
is not only a "big' sub language, as its 
morphology is also more complex. This high 
level of composition (at least compared to 
regular French or English languages) concerns 
about 10% of tokens within clinical patient 
records; therefore the lexicon contains also 
about 2000 affixes. For example, the token 
il~ojdjunostoraie s absent from the lexicon, 
however, this type of token may be recognized 
via its compounds ( ee Levis and al., 1997, for 
the so-called morphosemantemes): il~o, jdjuno, 
and stomie. 
2.2 Morphological analysis and medical 
morphology 
The morphological analysis associates every 
surface form with a list of morpho-syntactic 
features. When the surface form is not found in 
the lexicon, it follows a two.step guessing 
process: the first level (oraclel) is a more 
complex morphological nalyzer, based on the 
morphosemantemes, while the second level 
guesser (orcale2) attempts to provides a set of 
MS features looking at the longest ending (as 
described in Chanod and Tapanainen, 1995). 
The importance of these two levels is not clear 
for POS tagging, but becomes manifest when 
dealing with sense tagging. Let us consider three 
examples of tokens absent fxom the lexicon: 
allomorphiques, allomorphiquement (equivalent 
to allomorphic and allomorphically in Eng. 
remained ambiguous aRer disambiguafion, the 
residual ambiguity is therefore about 5.5%. In this 
sample, and before disambiguation, the number of 
ambiguous tokens was 150, which means an 
ambiguity rate of 20%. Thus, even using the same 
lexicon, the ambiguity rate seem higher for general 
corpora than for domain-specific ones. 
language) and allocution. In the first case, the 
prefix allo and the sufFm morphiques are listed 
in the morphosemantemes database (MDB). In 
the second case, morphiquement is not listed 
within the MDB, but ment can be found in it, In 
these two cases, therefore, oraclel is able to 
provide both the MS and the WS information 
associated. The latter example cannot be split 
into any morphemes, as cution is absent from the 
MDB. Thus, oraclesl is unable to recogniTe it, 
and finally oracle2 will be applied and will 
provide some MS features regarding exclusively 
the endings. The major ole given to oraclel and 
the semantic featu_es it provides is obvious for 
IR purposes. 
The final stage transforms ome of the lexical 
features returned by the morphological nalysis 
in a tag-like representation to be processed later 
by the tagger. 
2.3 FIPSTAG tagger and lexicon 
The FIPSTAG lexicon is a general French 
lexicon, therefore it contains most well-formed 
French words. The overall structure of the 
lexicon is mere or less stable, but the content is 
regularly updated in order to improve the 
coverage. Currently, the coverage is about 
200000 words with around 30000 lexical items. 
The lexicon is designed for deep parsing, so that, 
together with classical morpho.syntactic 
features, we can also find sub categorization of
verbs, semantic features, and some very specific 
grammatical classes. 
As the system is claimed to be general, it is 
supposed to master efficiently any unknown 
words: the lexical modules supply, in an 
equiprobable way, all the possible lexical 
categories (i.e. nouns, verbs, adjectives, and 
adverbs), as other categories are considered to 
be exhaustively listed in the lexicon. 
Consequently, the guesser does not rely on any 
morphological information, and only syntactic 
principles are applied to choose the relevant 
features.

When possible this tagset follows the MULTEXT 
(Ide and V6ronis 1994) morpho-syntactic description, 
modified within the GRACE action. But we must 
notice that the original MULTEXT description and 
the GRACE version (Paroubek and al. 1998, Rajman 
and ai. 1997) for the French language have not been 
foreseen for annotating morphemes. 
Previously, while attempting to assess the 
performance of  our tools, only a sample of the 
ad hoc corpus we built up was used, whereas the 
following studies on the ambiguities will be 
carried out on the whole corpus. Like in the 
validation task, the lexical ambiguities are based 
on the morphological analysis of each tagger, 
expressed in the MCT. First of all, table 3 gives 
the general ambiguity rate in each corpora: it 
clearly states that the total ambiguity rate in 
general corpora is about twice as big as in 
medical texts. 
A more precise table (tab. 4) provides at least 
two remarkable r sults. First, it shows that in the 
general corpus, less than a dozen words are 
responsible for half of the global ambiguity rate. 
These results must be compared to (Chanod and 
Tapainen, 1995), who situate this number 
around 16, while about six words generate the 
same level of  ambiguity in the medical corpus! 
This table also shows that the distribution of  the 
ambiguity type is also domain dependant. Thus, 
the ambiguity d\[fs\]-\[bs\]/proc is twice more 
frequent in medical texts, and the ambiguity 
represented by the tokens patient/patiente 
(masculine and feminine form of patient; which 
17 
may be a noun, an adjective, or some form of 
verb) is five times more frequent. On the 
contrary, some classes of ambiguity are simply 
absent or very rare in the medical domain (as for 
example v\[12\]/v\[s03\], or nc\[ms\]/v\[n\]). 
Finally, in table 5, we give the distribution of the 
most frequent syntactic ategories according to 
the corpus. In this table, a particularly interesting 
result concerns the imbalance between 
categories of noun phrases (detetTniner, noun, 
adjective...) and categories of 'verb phrases 
(verb, adverb...); the former being much more 
frequent in medical texts, whereas the latter are 
more frequent in general texts. Here we verify a 
well-known stylistic manner: medical reports are 
often written in a telegraphic sty\]te, where the 
verb is frequently implicit. As a corollary, 
nominalization phenomena re very frequent. 
Simple or complex numeral tokens (date, time, 
expressions with digits and measure symbols) 
are also much more frequent.

4. Discussion and conclusion 
We have showed that the lexical ambiguity in 
medical texts (considered as a paradigm of any 
particular domain) is different o the one in 
general texts, both at a purely quantitative l vel, 
and at a deeper qualitative l vel. Another esult 
concerns the difference in the distribution of the 
POS categories. All these particularities must be 
added to others: lexical, morphological, spelling 
and grammar errors. This last point has been 
rarely studied, but errors in documents, which 
are not intended for publication, may be quite 
impressive (the spelling error rate in our medical 
corpus was about 2%, i.e. up to one error every 
five sentences!). Finally, our conclusion is of 
two types: First, concerning the study, we 
showed that the use and comparison of taggers 
tailored for different corpora, supports ameasure 
of the difference between these corpora; second, 
at a more methodological level, if  it seems that 
the syntax may be -?eteris paribus- regarded as a 
domain-independent field (at least at a 
computational level, ef. Wehrli 1995), we 
argued that natural language processing 
appfications require domain-adaptable tools. 
Therefore, the use of NLP tools by other 
research fields must be very carefully related to 
the design of these tools. We suggest that 
adaptability should be explored in at least three 
directions4: 
1. Systems must allow lexical items to be 
added (custom lexicon) and removed from 
the lexicon; therefore access to the main 
lexicon must be available - at least 
negatively. 
2. Systems must be optionally applied with a 
specialised morphological nalyser module. 
3. MS description (tagset) should be 
parametrable, and this should include the 
ability to provide a mapping table.
