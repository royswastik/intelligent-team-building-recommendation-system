Abstract 
Optimizing the production, maintenance 
and extension of lexical resources is one 
the crucial aspects impacting Natural 
Language Processing (NLP). A second 
aspect involves optimizing the process 
leading to their integration in applica-
tions. With this respect, we believe that 
the production of a consensual specifica-
tion on multilingual lexicons can be a 
useful aid for the various NLP actors. 
Within ISO, one purpose of LMF (ISO-
24613) is to define a standard for lexi-
cons that covers multilingual data. 
1 Introduction 
Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) is a model 
that provides a common standardized framework 
for the construction of Natural Language Proc-
essing (NLP) lexicons. The goals of LMF are to 
provide a common model for the creation and 
use of lexical resources, to manage the exchange 
of data between and among these resources, and 
to enable the merging of a large number of indi-
vidual electronic resources to form extensive 
global electronic resources. 
Types of individual instantiations of LMF can 
include monolingual, bilingual or multilingual 
lexical resources. The same specifications are to 
be used for both small and large lexicons. The 
descriptions range from morphology, syntax, 
semantic to translation information organized as 
different extensions of an obligatory core pack-
age. The model is being developed to cover all 
natural languages. The range of targeted NLP 
applications is not restricted. LMF is also used to 
model machine readable dictionaries (MRD), 
which are not within the scope of this paper. 
2 History and current context 
In the past, this subject has been studied and de-
veloped by a series of projects like GENELEX 
[Antoni-Lay], EAGLES, MULTEXT, PAROLE, 
SIMPLE, ISLE and MILE [Bertagna]. More re-
cently within ISO1 the standard for terminology 
management has been successfully elaborated by 
the sub-committee three of ISO-TC37 and pub-
lished under the name "Terminology Markup 
Framework" (TMF) with the ISO-16642 refer-
ence. Afterwards, the ISO-TC37 National dele-
gations decided to address standards dedicated to 
NLP. These standards are currently elaborated as 
high level specifications and deal with word 
segmentation (ISO 24614), annotations 
(ISO 24611, 24612 and 24615), feature struc-
tures (ISO 24610), and lexicons (ISO 24613) 
with this latest one being the focus of the current 
paper. These standards are based on low level 
specifications dedicated to constants, namely 
data categories (revision of ISO 12620), lan-
guage codes (ISO 639), script codes 
(ISO 15924), country codes (ISO 3166), dates 
(ISO 8601) and Unicode (ISO 10646). 
 
This work is in progress. The two level organiza-
tion will form a coherent family of standards 
with the following simple rules: 
1) the low level specifications provide standard-
ized constants;

2) the high level specifications provide struc-
tural elements that are adorned by the standard-
ized constants. 
3 Scope and challenges 
The task of designing a lexicon model that satis-
fies every user is not an easy task. But all the 
efforts are directed to elaborate a proposal that 
fits the major needs of most existing models. 
In order to summarise the objectives, let's see 
what is in the scope and what is not. 
 
LMF addresses the following difficult chal-
lenges: 
? Represent words in languages where 
multiple orthographies (native scripts or 
transliterations) are possible, e.g. some 
Asian languages. 
? Represent explicitly (i.e. in extension) 
the morphology of languages where a de-
scription of all inflected forms (from a list 
of lemmatised forms) is manageable, e.g. 
English. 
? Represent the morphology of languages 
where a description in extension of all in-
flected forms is not manageable (e.g. Hun-
garian). In this case, representation in in-
tension is the only manageable issue. 
? Easily associate written forms and spo-
ken forms for all languages. 
? Represent complex agglutinating com-
pound words like in German. 
? Represent fixed, semi-fixed and flexible 
multiword expressions. 
? Represent specific syntactic behaviors, 
as in the Eagles recommendations. 
? Allow complex argument mapping be-
tween syntax and semantic descriptions, as 
in the Eagles recommendations. 
? Allow a semantic organisation based on 
SynSets (like in WordNet) or on semantic 
predicates (like in FrameNet). 
? Represent large scale multilingual re-
sources based on interlingual pivots or on 
transfer linking. 
LMF does not address the following topics: 
? General sentence grammar of a language 
? World knowledge representation 
In other words, LMF is mainly focused on the 
linguistic representation of lexical information. 
4 Key standards used by LMF 
LMF utilizes Unicode in order to represent the 
orthographies used in lexical entries regardless of 
language. 
Linguistic constants, like /feminine/ or 
/transitive/, are not defined within LMF but are 
specified in the Data Category Registry (DCR) 
that is maintained as a global resource by 
ISO TC37 in compliance with ISO/IEC 11179-
3:2003. 
The LMF specification complies with the 
modeling principles of Unified Modeling Lan-
guage (UML) as defined by OMG2 [Rumbaugh 
2004]. A model is specified by a UML class dia-
gram within a UML package: the class name is 
not underlined in the diagrams. The various ex-
amples of word description are represented by 
UML instance diagrams: the class name is under-
lined.  
5 Structure and core package 
LMF is comprised of two components: 
1) The core package consists of a structural 
skeleton that describes the basic hierarchy of in-
formation in a lexical entry. 
2) Extensions to the core package are ex-
pressed in a framework that describes the reuse 
of the core components in conjunction with addi-
tional components required for the description of 
the contents of a specific lexical resource. 
In the core package, the class called Database 
represents the entire resource and is a container 
for one or more lexicons. The Lexicon class is 
the container for all the lexical entries of the 
same language within the database. The Lexicon 
Information class contains administrative infor-
mation and other general attributes. The Lexical 
Entry class is a container for managing the top 
level language components. As a consequence, 
the number of representatives of single words, 
multi-word expressions and affixes of the lexicon 
is equal to the number of lexical entries in a 
given lexicon. The Form and Sense classes are 
parts of the Lexical Entry. Form consists of a text 
string that represents the word. Sense specifies or 
identifies the meaning and context of the related 
form. Therefore, the Lexical Entry manages the 
relationship between sets of related forms and 
their senses. If there is more than one orthogra-
                                                 
2 www.omg.org

phy for the word form (e.g. transliteration) the 
Form class may be associated with one to many 
Representation Frames, each of which contains a 
specific orthography and one to many data cate-
gories that describe the attributes of that orthog-
raphy. 
The core package classes are linked by the re-
lations as defined in the following UML class 
diagram:

Form class can be sub-classed into Lemmatised 
Form and Inflected Form class as follows: 
 
Lemmatised Form Inflected Form

A subset of the core package classes are ex-
tended to cover different kinds of linguistic data. 
All extensions conform to the LMF core package 
and cannot be used to represent lexical data in-
dependently of the core package. From the point 
of view of UML, an extension is a UML pack-
age. Current extensions for NLP dictionaries are: 
NLP Morphology3, NLP inflectional paradigm, 
NLP Multiword Expression pattern, NLP Syntax, 
NLP Semantic and Multilingual notations, which 
is the focus of this paper. 
6 NLP Multilingual Extension 
The NLP multilingual notation extension is 
dedicated to the description of the mapping be-
tween two or more languages in a LMF database. 
The model is based on the notion of Axis that 
links Senses, Syntactic Behavior and examples 
pertaining to different languages. "Axis" is a 
                                                 
3 Morphology, Syntax and Semantic packages are 
described in [Francopoulo].

term taken from the Papillon4 project [S?rasset 
2001] 5 . Axis can be organized at the lexicon 
manager convenience in order to link directly or 
indirectly objects of different languages.  
 
6.1 Considerations for standardizing multi-
lingual data  
The simplest configuration of multilingual 
data is a bilingual lexicon where a single link is 
used to represent the translation of a given 
form/sense pair from one language into another. 
But a survey of actual practices clearly reveals 
other requirements that make the model more 
complex. Consequently, LMF has focused on the 
following ones: 
 
(i) Cases where the relation 1-to-1 is impos-
sible because of lexical differences among lan-
guages. An example is the case of English word 
?river? that relates to French words ?rivi?re? and 
?fleuve?, where the latter is used for specifying 
that the referent is a river that flows into the sea. 
The bilingual lexicon should specify how these 
units relate. 
 
(ii) The bilingual lexicon approach should 
be optimized to allow the easiest management of 
large databases for real multilingual scenarios. In 
order to reduce the explosion of links in a multi-
bilingual scenario, translation equivalence can be 
managed through an intermediate "Axis". This 
object can be shared in order to contain the num-
ber of links in manageable proportions. 
 
(iii) The model should cover both transfer 
and pivot approaches to translation, taking also 
into account hybrid approaches. In LMF, the 
pivot approach is implemented by a ?Sense 
Axis?. The transfer approach is implemented by 
a ?Transfer Axis?. 
 
(iv) A situation that is not very easy to deal 
with is how to represent translations to languages 
that are similar or variants. The problem arises, 
for instance, when the task is to represent transla-
tions from English to both European Portuguese 
and Brazilian Portuguese. It is difficult to con-
                                                 
4 www.papillon-dictionary.org  
5 To be more precise, Papillon uses the term "axie" 
from "axis" and "lexie". In the beginning of the LMF 
project, we used the term "axie" but after some bad 
comments about using a non-English term in a stan-
dard, we decided to use the term "axis". 
sider them as two separate languages. In fact, one 
is a variant of the other. The differences are mi-
nor: a certain number of words are different and 
some limited phenomena in syntax are different. 
Instead of managing two distinct copies, it is 
more effective to manage one lexicon with some 
objects that are marked with a dialectal attribute. 
Concerning the translation from English to Por-
tuguese: a limited number of specific Axis in-
stances record this variation and the vast major-
ity of Axis instances is shared. 
 
(v) The model should allow for representing 
the information that restricts or conditions the 
translations. The representation of tests that 
combine logical operations upon syntactic and 
semantic features must be covered. 
6.2 Structure 
The model is based on the notion of Axis that 
link Senses, Syntactic Behavior and examples 
pertaining to different languages. Axis can be 
organized at the lexicon manager convenience in 
order to link directly or indirectly objects of dif-
ferent languages. A direct link is implemented by 
a single axis. An indirect link is implemented by 
several axis and one or several relations. 
The model is based on three main classes: 
Sense Axis, Transfer Axis, Example Axis. 
6.3 Sense Axis 
Sense Axis is used to link closely related 
senses in different languages, under the same 
assumptions of the interlingual pivot approach, 
and, optionally, it can also be used to refer to one 
or several external knowledge representation sys-
tems.  
The use of the Sense Axis facilitates the repre-
sentation of the translation of words that do not 
necessarily have the same valence or morpho-
logical form in one language than in another. For 
example, in a language, we can have a single 
word that will be translated by a compound word 
into another language: English ?wheelchair? to 
Spanish ?silla de ruedas?. Sense Axis may have 
the following attributes: a label, the name of an 
external descriptive system, a reference to a spe-
cific node inside an external description. 
6.4 Sense Axis Relation 
Sense Axis Relation permits to describe the 
linking between two different Sense Axis in-
stances. The element may have attributes like 
label, view, etc. 
4
6.6 Transfer Axis Relation 
Transfer Axis Relation links two Transfer Axis 
instances. The element may have attributes like: 
label, variation. 
The label enables the coding of simple inter-
lingual relations like the specialization of 
?fleuve? compared to ?rivi?re? and ?river?. It is 
not, however, the goal of this strategy to code a 
complex system for knowledge representation, 
which ideally should be structured as a complete 
coherent system designed specifically for that 
purpose. 
6.7 Source Test and Target Test 
Source Test permits to express a condition on 
the translation on the source language side while 
Target Test does it on the target language side. 
Both elements may have attributes like: text and 
comment. 
6.5 Transfer Axis 
Transfer Axis is designed to represent multi-
lingual transfer approach. Here, linkage refers to 
information contained in syntax. For example, 
this approach enables the representation of syn-
tactic actants involving inversion, such as (1): 
6.8 Example Axis  
Example Axis supplies documentation for 
sample translations. The purpose is not to record 
large scale multilingual corpora. The goal is to 
link a Lexical Entry with a typical example of 
translation. The element may have attributes like: 
comment, source. 
 
(1) fra:?elle me manque? => 
eng:?I miss her? 
 
Due to the fact that a lexical entry can be a 
support verb, it is possible to represent transla-
tions that start from a plain verb to a support verb 
like (2) that means "Mary dreams":

7 Three examples 
7.1 First example 
The first example is about the interlingual ap-
proach with two axis instances to represent a 
near match between "fleuve" in French and 
"river" in English. In the diagram, French is lo-
cated on the left side and English on the right 
side. The axis on the top is not linked directly to 
any English sense because this notion does not 
exist in English.  
: Sense Axis Relation
comment = flows into the sea
label = more precise
: Sense
label = eng:riverlabel = fra:rivi?re
: Sense
: Sense
label = fra:fleuve
: Sense Axis
: Sense Axis
 
 
7.2 Second example 
Let's see now an example about the transfer 
approach about slight variations between vari-
ants. The example is about English on one side 
and European Portuguese and Brazilian on the 
other side. Due to the fact that these two last 
variants have a very similar syntax, but with 
some local exceptions, the goal is to avoid a full 
and dummy duplication. For instance, the nomi-
native forms of the third person clitics are largely 
preferred in Brazilian rather than the oblique 
form as in European Portuguese. The transfer 
axis relations hold a label to distinguish which 
axis to use depending on the target object. 
 
: Transfer Axis Relation
label = European Portuguese
: Transfer Axis Relation
label = Brazilian
: Syntactic Behavior
label = let me see
: Syntactic Behavior
label = Deixa eu ver
: Syntactic Behavior
label = Deixa-me ver
: Transfer Axis
: Transfer Axis
: Transfer Axis
 
7.3 Third example 
A third example shows how to use the Trans-
fer Axis relation to relate different information in 
a multilingual transfer lexicon. It represents the 
translation of the English ?develop? into Italian 
and Spanish. Recall that the more general sense 
links ?eng:develop? and ?esp:desarrollar?. Both, 
Spanish and Italian, have restrictions that should 
6
be tested in the source language: if the second 
argument of the construction refers to certain 
elements (picture, mentalCreation, building) it 
should be translated into specific verbs.  
 
: Source Test
semanticRestriction = eng:mentalCreation
syntacticArgument = 2
: Source Test
semanticRestriction = eng:picture
syntacticArgument = 2
: Source Test
semanticRestriction = eng:building
syntacticArgument = 2

label = ita:sviluppare
: Syntactic Behavior
label = ita:costruire

label = eng:develop
: Syntactic Behavior
label = esp:construir

label = esp:desarrollar

8 LMF in XML  
During the last three years, the ISO group fo-
cused on the UML specification. In the last ver-
sion of the LMF document [LMF 2006] a DTD 
has been provided as an informative annex. The 
following conventions are adopted: 
? each UML attribute is transcoded as a 
DC (for Data Category) element 
? each UML class is transcoded as an 
XML element 
? UML aggregations are transcoded as 
content inclusion 
? UML shared associations (i.e. associa-
tions that are not aggregations) are 
transcoded as IDREF(S) 
The first example (i.e. "river") can be represented 
with the following XML tags:

9 Comparison 
A serious comparison with previously existing 
models is not possible in this current paper due 
to the lack of space. We advice the interested 
colleague to consult the technical report "Ex-
tended examples of lexicons using LMF" located 
at:  "http://lirics.loria.fr" in the document area. 
The report explains how to use LMF in order to 
represent OLIF-2, Parole/Clips, LC-Star, Word-
Net, FrameNet and BD?f. 
10 Conclusion 
In this paper we presented the results of the 
ongoing research activity of the LMF ISO stan-
dard. The design of a common and standardized 
framework for multilingual lexical databases will 
contribute to the optimization of the use of lexi-
cal resources, specially their reusability for dif-
ferent applications and tasks. Interoperability is 
the condition of a effective deployment of usable 
lexical resources. 
In order to reach a consensus, the work done 
has paid attention to the similarities and differ-
ences of existing lexicons and the models behind 
them.
