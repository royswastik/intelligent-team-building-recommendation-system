ABSTRACT
We describe the treatment of questions (Question-Answer
Typology, question parsing, and results) in the Weblcopedia
question answering system.  
1. INTRODUCTION
Several research projects have recently investigated the
problem of automatically answering simple questions that have
brief phrasal answers (?factoids?), by identifying and extracting
the answer from a large collection of text.  
The systems built in these projects exhibit a fairly standard
structure: they create a query from the user?s question, perform
IR with the query to locate (segments of) documents likely to
contain an answer, and then pinpoint the most likely answer
passage within the candidate documents.  The most common
difference lies in the pinpointing. Many projects employ a
window-based word scoring method that rewards desirable
words in the window.  They move the window across the
candidate answers texts/segments and return the window at the
position giving the highest total score.  A word is desirable if
it is a content word and it is either contained in the question, or
is a variant of a word contained in the question, or if it matches
the words of the expected answer.  Many variations of this
method are possible?of the scores, of the treatment of multi-
word phrases and gaps between desirable words, of the range of
variations allowed, and of the computation of the expected
answer words.  
Although it works to some degree (giving results of up to 30%
in independent evaluations), the window-based method has
several quite serious limitations:
? it cannot pinpoint answer boundaries precisely (e.g., an
exact name or noun phrase),
? it relies solely on information at the word level, and
hence cannot recognize information of the desired type
(such as Person or Location),
? it cannot locate and compose parts of answers that are
distributed over areas wider than the window.
Window-based pinpointing is therefore not satisfactory in the
long run, even for factoid QA.  In this paper we describe work
in our Webclopedia project on semantics-based answer
pinpointing. Initially, though, recognizing the simplicity and
power of the window-based technique for getting started, we
implemented a version of it as a fallback method.  We then
implemented two more sophisticated methods: syntactic-
semantic question analysis and QA pattern matching.  This
involves classification of QA types to facilitate recognition of
desired answer types, a robust syntactic-semantic parser to
analyze the question and candidate answers, and a matcher that
combines word- and parse-tree-level information to identify
answer passages more precisely.  We expect that the two
methods will really show their power when more complex non-
factoid answers are sought.  In this paper we describe how well
the three methods did relative to each other.  Section 2 outlines
the Webclopedia system.  Sections 3, 4, and 5 describe the
semantics-based components: a QA Typology, question and
answer parsing, and matching.  Finally, we outline current
work on automatically learning QA patterns using the Noisy
Channel Model.  
2. WEBCLOPEDIA
Webclopedia?s architecture (Figure 1) follows the pattern
outlined above:
Question parsing: Using BBN?s IdentiFinder [1], our
parser CONTEX (Section 4) produces a syntactic-semantic
analysis of the question and determines the QA type (Section
3).  
Query formation : Single- and multi-word units (content
words) are extracted from the analysis, and WordNet synsets are
used for query expansion.  A Boolean query is formed. See [9].
IR: The IR engine MG [12] returns the top-ranked 1000
documents.
Segmentat ion : To decrease the amount of text to be
processed, the documents are broken into semantically
coherent segments.  Two text segmenter?TexTiling [5] and
C99 [2]?were tried; the first is used; see [9].
Ranking segments : For each segment, each sentence i s
scored using a formula that rewards word and phrase overlap
with the question and its expanded query words.  Segments are
ranked.  See [9]
Parsing segments : CONTEX parses each sentence of the
top-ranked 100 segments (Section 4).  
Pinpointing: For each sentence, three steps of matching are
performed (Section 5); two compare the analyses of the
question and the sentence; the third uses the window method to
compute a goodness score.  
Ranking of answers : The candidate answers? scores are
compared and the winner(s) are output.
3. THE QA TYPOLOGY
In order to perform pinpointing deeper than the word level, the
system has to produce a representation of what the user i s
asking.  Some previous work in automated question answering
has categorized questions by question word or by a mixture of
question word and the semantic class of the answer [11, 10].  To
ensure full coverage of all forms of simple question and answer,
and to be able to factor in deviations and special requirements,
we are developing a QA Typology.  
We motivate the Typology (a taxonomy of QA types) as
follows.  
There are many ways to ask the same thing: What is the age o f
the Queen of Holland?  How old is the Netherlands? queen?  How
long has the ruler of Holland been alive?  Likewise, there are
many ways of delivering the same answer: about 60; 63 years
old; since January 1938.  Such variations form a sort of
semantic equivalence class of both questions and answers.
Since the user may employ any version of his or her question,
and the source documents may contain any version(s) of the
answer, an efficient system should group together equivalent
question types and answer types.  Any specific question can
then be indexed into its type, from which all equivalent forms
of the answer can be ascertained.  These QA equivalence types
can help with both query expansion and answer pinpointing.
However, the equivalence is fuzzy; even slight variations
introduce exceptions: who invented the gas laser? can be
answered by both Ali Javan and a scientist at MIT, while what
is the name of the person who invented the gas laser? requires
the former only.  This inexactness suggests that the QA types
be organized in an inheritance hierarchy, allowing the answer
requirements satisfying more general questions to be
overridden by more specific ones ?lower down?.  
These considerations help structure the Webclopedia QA
Typology.  Instead of focusing on question word or semantic
type of the answer, our classes attempt to represent the user?s
intention, including for example the classes Why-Famous (for
Who was Christopher Columbus? but not Who discovered

America?, which is the QA type Proper-Person) and
Abbreviation-Expansion (for What does HLT stand for?).  In
addition, the QA Typology becomes increasingly specific as
one moves from the root downward.
To create the QA Typology, we analyzed 17,384 questions and
their answers (downloaded from answers.com); see (Gerber, in
prep.).  The Typology (Figure 2) contains 72 nodes, whose leaf
nodes capture QA variations that can in many cases be further
differentiated.
Each Typology node has been annotated with examples and
typical patterns of expression of both Question and Answer,
using a simple template notation that expressed configurations
of words and parse tree annotations (Figure 3).  Question
pattern information (specifically, the semantic type of the
answer required, which we call a Qtarget) is produced by the
CONTEX parser (Section 4) when analyzing the question,
enabling it to output its guess(s) for the QA type.  Answer
pattern information is used by the Matcher (Section 5) to
pinpoint likely answer(s) in the parse trees of candidate answer
sentences.

At the time of the TREC-9 Q&A evaluation, we had produced
approx. 500 patterns by simply cross-combining approx. 20
Question patterns with approx. 25 Answer patterns.  To our
disappointment (Section 6), these patterns were both too
specific and too few to identify answers frequently?when they
applied, they were quite accurate, but they applied too seldom.
We therefore started work on automatically learning QA
patterns in parse trees (Section 7).  On the other hand, the
semantic class of the answer (the Qtarget) is used to good effect
(Sections 4 and 6).
4. PARSING
CONTEX is a deterministic machine-learning based grammar
learner/parser that was originally built for MT [6].  For
English, parses of unseen sentences measured 87.6% labeled
precision and 88.4% labeled recall, trained on 2048 sentences
from the Penn Treebank. Over the past few years it has been
extended to Japanese and Korean [7].
4.1 Parsing Questions
Accuracy is particularly important for question parsing,
because for only one question there may be several answers in a
large document collection.  In particular, it is important to
identify as specific a Qtarget as possible.  But grammar rules

for declarative sentences do not apply well to questions, which
although typically shorter than declaratives, exhibit markedly
different word order, preposition stranding (?What university
was Woodrow Wilson President of??), etc.  
Unfortunately for CONTEX, questions to train on were not
initially easily available; the Wall Street Journal sentences
contain a few questions, often from quotes, but not enough and
not representative enough to result in an acceptable level of
question parse accuracy.  By collecting and treebanking,
however, we increased the number of questions in the training
data from 250 (for our TREC-9 evaluation version of
Webclopedia) to 400 on Oct 16 to 975 on Dec 9.  The effect i s
shown in Table 1.  In the first test run (?[trained] without
[additional questions]?), CONTEX was trained mostly on
declarative sentences (2000 Wall Street Journal sentences,
namely the enriched Penn Treebank, plus a few other non-
question sentences such as imperatives and short phrases).  In
later runs (?[trained] with [add. questions]?), the system was
trained on the same examples plus a subset of the 1153
questions we have treebanked at ISI (38 questions from the pre-
TREC-8 test set, all 200 from TREC-8 and 693 TREC-9, and
222 others).
The TREC-8 and TREC-9 questions were divided into 5 subsets,
used in a five-fold cross validation test in which the system was
trained on all but the test questions, and then evaluated on the
test questions.   
Reasons for the improvement include (1) significantly more
training data; (2) a few additional features, some more treebank
cleaning, a bit more background knowledge etc.; and (3) the
251 test questions on Oct. 16 were probably a little bit harder
on average, because a few of the TREC-9 questions initially
treebanked (and included in the October figures) were selected
for early treebanking because they represented particular
challenges, hurting subsequent Qtarget processing.
4.2 Parsing Potential Answers
The semantic type ontology in CONTEX was extended to
include 115 Qtarget types, plus some combined types; more
details in [8].  Beside the Qtargets that refer to concepts in
CONTEX?s concept ontology (see first example below),
Qtargets can also refer to part of speech labels (first example),
to constituent roles or slots of parse trees (second and third
examples), and to more abstract nodes in the QA Typology
(later examples). For questions with the Qtargets Q-WHY-
FAMOUS, Q-WHY-FAMOUS-PERSON, Q-SYNONYM, and
others, the parser also provides Qargs?information helpful for
matching (final examples).
Semantic ontology types (I-EN-CITY)
and part of speech labels (S-PROPER-NAME):
What is the capital of Uganda?
QTARGET: (((I-EN-CITY S-PROPER-NAME))
((EQ I-EN-PROPER-PLACE)))
Parse tree roles:
Why can't ostriches fly?
      QTARGET: (((ROLE REASON)))
Name a film in which Jude Law acted.
      QTARGET: (((SLOT TITLE-P TRUE)))
QA Typology nodes:
What are the Black Hills known for?
     Q-WHY-FAMOUS
What is Occam's Razor?
     Q-DEFINITION
What is another name for nearsightedness?
     Q-SYNONYM
Should you exercise when you're sick?
     Q-YES-NO-QUESTION
Qargs for additional information:
Who was Betsy Ross?
     QTARGET: (((Q-WHY-FAMOUS-PERSON)))  
     QARGS: (("Betsy Ross"))
How is "Pacific Bell" abbreviated?
     QTARGET: (((Q-ABBREVIATION)))
     QARGS: (("Pacific Bell"))
What are geckos?
     QTARGET: (((Q-DEFINITION)))
     QARGS: (("geckos" "gecko") ("animal"))
These Qtargets are determined during parsing using 276 hand-
written rules.  Still, for approx. 10% of the TREC-8&9
questions there is no easily determinable Qtarget (?What does
the Peugeot company manufacture??; ?What is caliente in
English??).  Strategies for dealing with this are under
investigation.  More details appear in (Hermjakob, 2001).  The
current accuracy of the parser on questions and resulting
Qtargets sentences is shown in Table 2.
5. ANSWER MATCHING
The Matcher performs three independent matches, in order:
? match QA patterns in the parse tree,
? match Qtargets and Qwords in the parse tree,
? match over the answer text using a word window.
Details appear in [9].

6. RESULTS
We entered the TREC-9 short form QA track, and received an
overall Mean Reciprocal Rank score of 0.318, which put
Webclopedia in essentially tied second place with two others.
(The best system far outperformed those in second place.)  
In order to determine the relative performance of the modules,
we counted how many correct answers their output contained,
working on our training corpus.  Table 3 shows the evolution
of the system over a sample one-month period, reflecting the
amount of work put into different modules.  The modules QA
pattern, Qtarget, Qword, and Window were all run in parallel
from the same Ranker output.  
The same pattern, albeit with lower scores, occurred in the
TREC test (Table 4).  The QA patterns made only a small
contribution, the Qtarget made by far the largest contribution,
and, interestingly, the word-level window match lay
somewhere in between.

attributable to each module.
IR hits QA pattern Qtarget Window Total
78.1 5.5 26.2 10.4 30.3
We are pleased with the performance of the Qtarget match.  This
shows that CONTEX is able to identify to some degree the
semantic type of the desired answer, and able to pinpoint these
types also in candidate answers.  The fact that it outperforms
the window match indicates the desirability of looking deeper
than the surface level.  As discussed in Section 4, we are
strengthening the parser?s ability to identify Qtargets.  
We are disappointed in the performance of the 500 QA patterns.
Analysis suggests that we had too few patterns, and the ones we
had were too specific.  When patterns matched, they were rather
accurate, both in finding correct answers and more precisely
pinpointing the boundaries of answers.  However, they were
too sensitive to variations in phrasing.  Furthermore, it was
difficult to construct robust and accurate question and answer
phraseology patterns manually, for several reasons.  First,
manual construction relies on the inventiveness of the pattern
builder to foresee variations of phrasing, for both question and
answer.  It is however nearly impossible to think of all
possible variations when building patterns.  
Second, it is not always clear at what level of representation to
formulate the pattern: when should one specify using words?
Parts of speech? Other parse tree nodes? Semantic classes?  The
patterns in Figure 3 include only a few of these alternatives.
Specifying the wrong elements can result in non-optimal
coverage.  Third, the work is simply tedious.  We therefore
decided to try to learn QA patterns automatically.  
7. TOWARD LEARNING QA PATTERNS
AUTOMATICALLY
To learn corresponding question and answer expressions, we
pair up the parse trees of a question and (each one of) its
answer(s).  We then apply a set of matching criteria to identify
potential corresponding portions of the trees.  We then use the
EM algorithm to learn the strengths of correspondence
combinations at various levels of representation.  This work i s
still in progress.  
In order to learn this information we observe the truism that
there are many more answers than questions. This holds for the
two QA corpora we have access to?TREC and an FAQ website
(since discontinued).  We therefore use the familiar version of
the Noisy Channel Model and Bayes? Rule.   For each basic QA
type (Location, Why-Famous, etc.):

/ (number of nodes in A tree)
As usual, many variations are possible, including how to
determine likelihood of expressing a true answer; whether to
consider all nodes or just certain major syntactic ones (N, NP,
VP, etc.); which information within each node to consider
(syntactic? semantic? lexical?); how to define ?covarying
information??node identity? individual slot value equality?;
what to do about the actual answer node in the A trees; if (and
how) to represent the relationships among A nodes that have
been found to be important; etc.  Figure 4 provides an answer
parse tree that indicates likely Location nodes, determined by
appropriate syntactic class, semantic type, and syntactic role
in the sentence.  
Our initial model focuses on bags of corresponding QA parse
tree nodes, and will help to indicate for a given question what
type of node(s) will contain the answer.  We plan to extend this
model to capture structured configurations of nodes that, when
matched to a question, will help indicate where in the parse tree
of a potential answer sentence the answer actually lies.  Such
bags or structures of nodes correspond, at the surface level, to
important phrases or words.  However, by using CONTEX
output we abstract away from the surface level, and learn to
include whatever syntactic and/or semantic information is best
suited for predicting likely answers.
