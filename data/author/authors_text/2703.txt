Abstract
This paper presents a general architec-
ture and four algorithms that use Natu-
ral Language Processing for automatic on-
tology matching. The proposed approach
is purely instance based, i.e., only the
instance documents associated with the
nodes of ontologies are taken into account.
The four algorithms have been evaluated
using real world test data, taken from the
Google and LookSmart online directories.
The results show that NLP techniques ap-
plied to instance documents help the sys-
tem achieve higher performance.
1 Introduction
Many fundamental issues about the viability and
exploitation of the web as a linguistic corpus have
not been tackled yet. The web is a massive reposi-
tory of text and multimedia data. However, there is
not a systematic way of classifying and retrieving
these documents. Computational Linguists are of
course not the only ones looking at these issues;
research on the Semantic Web focuses on pro-
viding a semantic description of all the resources
on the web, resulting into a mesh of information
linked up in such a way as to be easily process-
able by machines, on a global scale. You can think
of it as being an efficient way of representing data
on the World Wide Web, or as a globally linked
database.1 The way the vision of the Semantic
Web will be achieved, is by describing each doc-
ument using languages such as RDF Schema and
OWL, which are capable of explicitly expressing
the meaning of terms in vocabularies and the rela-
tionships between those terms.
1http://infomesh.net/2001/swintro/
The issue we are focusing on in this paper is
that these languages are used to define ontologies
as well. If ultimately a single ontology were used
to describe all the documents on the web, sys-
tems would be able to exchange information in a
transparent way for the end user. The availability
of such a standard ontology would be extremely
helpful to NLP as well, e.g., it would make it far
easier to retrieve all documents on a certain topic.
However, until this vision becomes a reality, a plu-
rality of ontologies are being used to describe doc-
uments and their content. The task of automatic
ontology alignment ormatching (Hughes and Ash-
pole, 2005) then needs to be addressed.
The task of ontology matching has been typi-
cally carried out manually or semi-automatically,
for example through the use of graphical user in-
terfaces (Noy and Musen, 2000). Previous work
has been done to provide automated support to this
time consuming task (Rahm and Bernstein, 2001;
Cruz and Rajendran, 2003; Doan et al, 2003;
Cruz et al, 2004; Subba and Masud, 2004). The
various methods can be classified into two main
categories: schema based and instance based.
Schema based approaches try to infer the seman-
tic mappings by exploiting information related to
the structure of the ontologies to be matched, like
their topological properties, the labels or descrip-
tion of their nodes, and structural constraints de-
fined on the schemas of the ontologies. These
methods do not take into account the actual data
classified by the ontologies. On the other hand,
instance based approaches look at the information
contained in the instances of each element of the
schema. These methods try to infer the relation-
ships between the nodes of the ontologies from
the analysis of their instances. Finally, hybrid
approaches combine schema and instance based
51
methods into integrated systems.
Neither instance level information, nor NLP
techniques have been extensively explored in pre-
vious work on ontology matching. For exam-
ple, (Agirre et al, 2000) exploits documents (in-
stances) on the WWW to enrich WordNet (Miller
et al, 1990), i.e., to compute ?concept signatures,?
collection of words that significantly distinguish
one sense from another, however, not directly for
ontology matching. (Liu et al, 2005) uses doc-
uments retrieved via queries augmented with, for
example, synonyms that WordNet provides to im-
prove the accuracy of the queries themselves, but
not for ontology matching. NLP techniques such
as POS tagging, or parsing, have been used for
ontology matching, but on the names and defini-
tions in the ontology itself, for example, in (Hovy,
2002), hence with a schema based methodology.
In this paper, we describe the results we ob-
tained when using some simple but effective NLP
methods to align web ontologies, using an instance
based approach. As we will see, our results show
that more sophisticated methods do not necessar-
ily lead to better results.
2 General architecture
The instance based approach we propose uses
NLP techniques to compute matching scores
based on the documents classified under the nodes
of ontologies. There is no assumption on the struc-
tural properties of the ontologies to be compared:
they can be any kind of graph representable in
OWL. The instance documents are assumed to be
text documents (plain text or HTML).
The matching process starts from a pair of on-
tologies to be aligned. The two ontologies are
traversed and, for each node having at least one
instance, the system computes a signature based
on the instance documents. Then, the signatures
associated to the nodes of the two ontologies are
compared pairwise, and a similarity score for each
pair is generated. This score could then be used
to estimate the likelihood of a match between a
pair of nodes, under the assumption that the se-
mantics of a node corresponds to the semantics of
the instance documents classified under that node.
Figure 1 shows the architecture of our system.
The two main issues to be addressed are (1)
the representation of signatures and (2) the def-
inition of a suitable comparison metric between
signatures. For a long time, the Information Re-

Figure 2: Baseline signature creation
trieval community has succesfully adopted a ?bag
of words? approach to effectively represent and
compare text documents. We start from there to
define a general signature structure and a metric to
compare signatures.
A signature is defined as a function S : K ?
R+, mapping a finite set of keys (which can be
complex objects) to positive real values. With a
signature of that form, we can use the cosine sim-
ilarity metric to score the similarity between two
signatures:
simil(S1, S2) =
?
p S1(kp)S2(kp)
?
?
i S1(ki)
2 ?
??
j S2(kj)
2
kp ? K1 ?K2, ki ? K1, kj ? K2
The cosine similarity formula produces a value
in the range [0, 1]. The meaning of that value de-
pends on the algorithm used to build the signa-
ture. In particular, there is no predefined thresh-
old that can be used to discriminate matches from
non-matches. However, such a threshold could be
computed a-posteriori from a statistical analysis of
experimental results.
2.1 Signature generation algorithms
For our experiments, we defined and implemented
four algorithms to generate signatures. The four
algorithms make use of text and language process-
ing techniques of increasing complexity.
2.1.1 Algorithm 1: Baseline signature
The baseline algorithm performs a very simple
sequence of text processing, schematically repre-
sented in Figure 2.

HTML tagsremoval Tokenizationpunctuationremoval Lowercaseconversion
Noungroupingand countingPOS tagging
Figure 3: Noun signature creation
HTML tags are first removed from the in-
stance documents. Then, the texts are tokenized
and punctuation is removed. Everything is then
converted to lowercase. Finally, the tokens are
grouped and counted. The final signature has the
form of a mapping table token ? frequency.
The main problem we expected with this
method is the presence of a lot of noise. In fact,
many ?irrelevant? words, like determiners, prepo-
sitions, and so on, are added to the final signature.
2.1.2 Algorithm 2: Noun signature
To cope with the problem of excessive noise,
people in IR often use fixed lists of stop words
to be removed from the texts. Instead, we intro-
duced a syntax based filter in our chain of pro-
cessing. The main assuption is that nouns are the
words that carry most of the meaning for our kind
of document comparison. Thus, we introduced
a part-of-speech tagger right after the tokeniza-
tion module (Figure 3). The results of the tagger
are used to discard everything but nouns from the
input documents. The part-of-speech tagger we
used ?QTAG 3.1 (Tufis and Mason, 1998), readily
available on the web as a Java library? is a Hidden
Markov Model based statistical tagger.
The problems we expected with this approach
are related to the high specialization of words in
natural language. Different nouns can bear simi-
lar meaning, but our system would treat them as if
they were completely unrelated words. For exam-
ple, the words ?apple? and ?orange? are semanti-
cally closer than ?apple? and ?chair,? but a purely
syntactic approach would not make any difference
between these two pairs. Also, the current method
does not include morphological processing, so dif-
ferent inflections of the same word, such as ?ap-
ple? and ?apples,? are treated as distinct words.
In further experiments, we also considered
verbs, another syntactic category of words bearing
a lot of semantics in natural language. We com-
puted signatures with verbs only, and with verbs
and nouns together. In both cases, however, the

performance of the system was worse. Thus, we
will not consider verbs in the rest of the paper.
2.1.3 Algorithm 3: WordNet signature
To address the limitations stated above, we used
the WordNet lexical resource (Miller et al, 1990).
WordNet is a dictionary where words are linked
together by semantic relationships. In Word-
Net, words are grouped into synsets, i.e., sets of
synonyms. Each synset can have links to other
synsets. These links represent semantic relation-
ships like hypernymy, hyponymy, and so on.
In our approach, after the extraction of nouns
and their grouping, each noun is looked up on
WordNet (Figure 4). The synsets to which the
noun belongs are added to the final signature in
place of the noun itself. The signature can also
be enriched with the hypernyms of these synsets,
up to a specified level. The final signature has the
form of a mapping synset ? value, where value is
a weighted sum of all the synsets found.
Two important parameters of this method are
related to the hypernym expansion process men-
tioned above. The first parameter is the maximum
level of hypernyms to be added to the signature
(hypernym level). A hypernym level value of 0
would make the algorithm add only the synsets of
a word, without any hypernym, to the signature. A
value of 1 would cause the algorithm to add also
their parents in the hypernym hierarchy to the sig-
nature. With higher values, all the ancestors up to
the specified level are added. The second parame-
ter, hypernym factor, specifies the damping of the
weight of the hypernyms in the expansion process.
Our algorithm exponentially dampens the hyper-
nyms, i.e., the weigth of a hypernym decreases ex-
ponentially as its level increases. The hypernym
factor is the base of the exponential function.
In general, a noun can have more than one
sense, e.g., ?apple? can be either a fruit or a tree.
This is reflected in WordNet by the fact that a
noun can belong to multiple synsets. With the
current approach, the system cannot decide which

sense is the most appropriate, so all the senses
of a word are added to the final signature, with
a weight inversely proportional to the number of
possible senses of that word. This fact poten-
tially introduces semantic noise in the signature,
because many irrelevant senses might be added to
the signature itself.
Another limitation is that a portion of the nouns
in the source texts cannot be located in WordNet
(see Figure 6). Thus, we also tried a variation (al-
gorithm 3+2) that falls back on to the bare lexi-
cal form of a noun if it cannot be found in Word-
Net. This variation, however, resulted in a slight
decrease of performance.
2.1.4 Algorithm 4: Disambiguated signature
The problem of having multiple senses for each
word calls for the adoption of word sense dis-
ambiguation techniques. Thus, we implemented
a word sense disambiguator algorithm, and we
inserted it into the signature generation pipeline
(Figure 5). For each noun in the input documents,
the disambiguator takes into account a specified
number of context words, i.e., nouns preceding
and/or following the target word. The algorithm
computes a measure of the semantic distance be-
tween the possible senses of the target word and
the senses of each of its context words, pair-
wise. A sense for the target word is chosen such
that the total distance to its context is minimized.
The semantic distance between two synsets is de-
fined here as the minimum number of hops in
the WordNet hypernym hierarchy connecting the
two synsets. This definition allows for a rela-
tively straightforward computation of the seman-
tic distance using WordNet. Other more sophisti-
cated definitions of semantic distance can be found
in (Patwardhan et al, 2003). The word sense
disambiguation algorithm we implemented is cer-
tainly simpler than others proposed in the litera-
ture, but we used it to see whether a method that is
relatively simple to implement could still help.
The overall parameters for this signature cre-
ation algorithm are the same as the WordNet sig-
nature algorithm, plus two additional parameters
for the word sense disambiguator: left context
length and right context length. They represent re-
spectively how many nouns before and after the
target should be taken into account by the dis-
ambiguator. If those two parameters are both set
to zero, then no context is provided, and the first
possible sense is chosen. Notice that even in this
case the behaviour of this signature generation al-
gorithm is different from the previous one. In
a WordNet signature, every possible sense for a
word is inserted, whereas in a WordNet disam-
biguated signature only one sense is added.
3 Experimental setting
All the algorithms described in the previous sec-
tion have been fully implemented in a coherent
and extensible framework using the Java program-
ming language, and evaluation experiments have
been run. This section describes how the experi-
ments have been conducted.
3.1 Test data
The evaluation of ontology matching approaches
is usually made difficult by the scarceness of test
ontologies readily available in the community.
This problem is even worse for instance based ap-
proaches, because the test ontologies need also to
be ?filled? with instance documents. Also, we
wanted to test our algorithms with ?real world?
data, rather than toy examples.
We were able to collect suitable test data start-
ing from the ontologies published by the Ontology
Alignment Evaluation Initiative 2005 (Euzenat et
al., 2005). A section of their data contained an
OWL representation of fragments of the Google,
Yahoo, and LookSmart web directories. We ?re-
verse engineered? some of this fragments, in or-
der to reconstruct two consistent trees, one rep-
resenting part of the Google directory structure,
the other representing part of the LookSmart hi-
erarchy. The leaf nodes of these trees were filled
with instances downloaded from the web pages
classified by the appropriate directories. With this
method, we were able to fill 7 nodes of each ontol-
ogy with 10 documents per node, for a total of 140
documents. Each document came from a distinct
web page, so there was no overlap in the data to be
compared. A graphical representation of our two
test ontologies, source and target, is shown in Fig-
54
ure 6. The darker outlined nodes are those filled
with instance documents. For the sake of readabil-
ity, the names of the nodes corresponding to real
matches are the same. Of course, this informa-
tion is not used by our algorithms, which adopt a
purely instance based approach. Figure 6 also re-
ports the size of the instance documents associated
to each node: total number of words, noun tokens,
nouns, and nouns covered by WordNet.
3.2 Parameters
The experiments have been run with several com-
binations of the relevant parameters: number of
instance documents per node (5 or 10), algorithm
(1 to 4), extracted parts of speech (nouns, verbs, or
both), hypernym level (an integer value equal or
greater than zero), hypernym factor (a real num-
ber), and context length (an integer number equal
or greater than zero). Not all of the parameters are
applicable to every algorithm. The total number of
runs was 90.
4 Results
Each run of the system with our test ontologies
produced a set of 49 values, representing the
matching score of every pair of nodes containing
instances across the two ontologies. Selected ex-
amples of these results are shown in Tables 1, 2,
3, and 4. In the experiments shown in those ta-
bles, 10 instance documents for each node were
used to compute the signatures. Nodes that ac-
tually match (identified by the same label, e.g.,
?Canada? and ?Canada?) should show high sim-
ilarity scores, whereas nodes that do not match
(e.g., ?Canada? and ?Dendrochronology?), should
have low scores. Better algorithms would have
higher scores for matching nodes, and lower score
for non-matching ones. Notice that the two nodes
?Egypt? and ?Pyramid Theories,? although intu-
itively related, have documents that take different
perspectives on the subject. So, the algorithms
correctly identify the nodes as being different.
Looking at the results in this form makes it dif-
ficult to precisely assess the quality of the algo-
rithms. To do so, a statistical analysis has to be
performed. For each table of results, let us parti-
tion the scores in two distinct sets:
A = {simil(nodei, nodej) | real match = true}
B = {simil(nodei, nodej) | real match = false}

With our test data, we would have 6 values in
set A and 43 values in set B. Then, let us com-
pute average and standard deviation of the values
included in each set. The average of A represents
the expected score that the system would assign
to a match; likewise, the average of B is the ex-
pected score of a non-match. We define the fol-
lowing measure to compare the performance of
our matching algorithms, inspired by ?effect size?
from (VanLehn et al, 2005):
discrimination size =
avg(A) ? avg(B)
stdev(A) + stdev(B)
Higher discrimination values mean that the
scores assigned to matches and non-matches are
more ?far away,? making it possible to use those
scores to make more reliable decisions about the
matching degree of pairs of nodes.
Table 5 shows the values of discrimination size
(last column) out of selected results from our ex-
periments. The algorithm used is reported in the
first column, and the values of the other relevant
parameters are indicated in other columns. We can
make the following observations.
? Algorithms 2, 3, and 4 generally outperform
the baseline (algorithm 1).
? Algorithm 2 (Noun signature), which still
uses a fairly simple and purely syntactical
technique, shows a substantial improvement.
Algorithm 3 (WordNet signature), which in-
troduces some additional level of semantics,
has even better performance.
? In algorithms 3 and 4, hypernym expansion
looks detrimental to performance. In fact, the
best results are obtained with hypernym level
equal to zero (no hypernym expansion).
? The word sense disambiguator implemented
in algorithm 4 does not help. Even though
disambiguating with some limited context
(1 word before and 1 word after) provides
slightly better results than choosing the first
available sense for a word (context length
equal to zero), the overall results are worse
than adding all the possible senses to the sig-
nature (algorithm 3).
? Using only 5 documents per node signifi-
cantly degrades the performance of all the al-
gorithms (see the last 5 lines of the table).
5 Conclusions and future work
The results of our experiments point out several

Table 5: Results ? Discrimination size
some more specific and some more general. As
regards the more specific issues,
? Algorithm 2 does not perform morphological
processing, whereas Algorithm 3 does. How
much of the improved effectiveness of Algo-
rithm 3 is due to this fact? To answer this
question, Algorithm 2 could be enhanced to
include a morphological processor.
? The effectiveness of Algorithms 3 and 4 may
be hindered by the fact that many words are
not yet included in theWordNet database (see
Figure 6). Falling back on to Algorithm 2
proved not to be a solution. The impact of the
incompleteness of the lexical resource should
be investigated and assessed more precisely.
Another venue of research may be to exploit
different thesauri, such as the ones automati-
cally derived as in (Curran andMoens, 2002).
? The performance of Algorithm 4 might be
improved by using more sophisticated word
sense disambiguation methods. It would also
be interesting to explore the application of
the unsupervised method described in (Mc-
Carthy et al, 2004).
As regards our long term plans, first, structural
properties of the ontologies could potentially be
exploited for the computation of node signatures.
This kind of enhancement would make our system
move from a purely instance based approach to a
combined hybrid approach based on schema and
instances.
More fundamentally, we need to address the
lack of appropriate, domain specific resources that
can support the training of algorithms and models
appropriate for the task at hand. WordNet is a very
general lexicon that does not support domain spe-
cific vocabulary, such as that used in geosciences
or in medicine or simply that contained in a sub-
ontology that users may define according to their
interests. Of course, we do not want to develop
by hand domain specific resources that we have to
change each time a new domain arises.
The crucial research issue is how to exploit ex-
tremely scarce resources to build efficient and ef-
fective models. The issue of scarce resources
makes it impossible to use methods that are suc-
cesful at discriminating documents based on the
words they contain but that need large corpora
for training, for example Latent Semantic Anal-
ysis (Landauer et al, 1998). The experiments de-
scribed in this paper could be seen as providing
57
a bootstrapped model (Riloff and Jones, 1999; Ng
and Cardie, 2003)?in ML, bootstrapping requires
to seed the classifier with a small number of well
chosen target examples. We could develop a web
spider, based on the work described on this paper,
to automatically retrieve larger amounts of train-
ing and test data, that in turn could be processed
with more sophisticated NLP techniques.
