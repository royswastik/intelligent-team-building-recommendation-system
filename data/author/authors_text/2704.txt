This paper proposes a grammar-based approach to 
semantic annotation which combines the notions of 
robust parsing and fuzzy grammars. We present an 
overview of a preliminary research aimed to gener- 
alize some results from a recent project on interac- 
tion through speech with information systems where 
techniques based on the above notions have been 
successfully applied. The goal of the article is to 
give a development environment to linguists? 
1 In t roduct ion  
In this article we are mainly interested in seman- 
tic annotation (Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard, 
1994). We are considering the Information Extrac- 
tion (I.E.) problem as a semantic annotation prob- 
lem: extracting information is finding the relevant 
terms that contribute to describe an appropriate se- 
mantic structure of the text. Some of the most ira-. 
portant works in I.E. have been dealing with domain 
dependent documents like (Moll et al, 1998; Hobbs 
et al, 1996). Both systems employ complex analysis 
schemas. Assigning semantic field tags is in general 
a difficult task. This is due at least to the crucial 
need of the domain knowledge and also of the lin- 
guistic knowledge. Our approach considers that for 
some specific domains a semantic annotation can be 
achieved by a light parsing of the text which is based 
on the user of certain cue-words as a heuristic for de- 
scribing its semantic structure. 
1.1 h case s tudy  in query  generat ion  
The availability of a large collection of annotated 
telephone calls for querying the Swiss phone-book 
database (i.e the Swiss French PolyPhone corpus) al- 
lowed us to experiment our recent findings in robust 
text analysis obtained in the context of the Swiss 
National Fund research project ROTA (Robust Text 
Analysis), and in the recent Swisscom funded project 
ISIS (Interaction through Speech with Information 
Systems) 1 (Chappelier et al, 1999). This database 
contains 4293 simulated recordings related to the 
1The final report of ISIS project is available at

"111" Swisscom service calls. For instance a query 
call like: 
Bonjour j'aimerais un num4ro de 
t~l~phone & Saignelegier c'est 
Mottaz m o deux ta z Monique rue du 
printemps num~ro quatre 
would produce the following query frame filling for 
the Swiss Phone-book database: 
Nom de famille / Firme: MOTTAZ 
Pr~nom / Autres informations: MONIQUE 
Rue, num~ro: rue du PRINTEMPS, 4 
NPA, localitY: SAIGNELEGIER. 
The goal of semantic annotation is to provide a tree 
structure which can be superposed over the flat sen- 
tence. This structure can be supported by a PRO- 
LOG compound term consisting of "tag" functors 
and list arguments. Moreover this same structure 
can also be supported by the SGML structural rep- 
resentation. The translation between the two models 
is an intuitive task and an example of such transla- 
tion is provided by the two following corresponding 
representations for a possible query call schema. 
PROLOG:  
S(\[ .... announce(\[...\] ), 
query ( \[ . . . .  
name ( \[ . . . .  
f am_name ( C.. ? \] ) . . . . .  
first_name(\[...\]), 
...\]) ..... 
address  ( \[ . . . .  
s t reet ( \ [ . . . \ ] )  . . . . .  
city(\[...\]), 
. . . \ ] ) ,  
. . . \ ] )  
. . . \ ] ) .  
SGML:  
<announce> 
</~ounce> 
<query> 
<name> 
19 
? . ? 
<fam_name> 
<first_name> 
</name> 
<address> 
<street> 
<city> 
</address> 
? .. 
</query> 
. . .  < / ram_name> 
? . .  < / f i r s t _name> 
... </street> 
. . .  </city> 
1.1.1 Processing phases  
The processing of the corpus data is performed at 
various linguistic levels by modules organized into 
a pipeline? Each module assumes as input the out- 
put of the preceding module? The main goal of this 
architecture is to understand how far it is possible 
to go without using any kind of feedback and in- 
teractions among different linguistic modules? At 
a first stage, morphologic and syntactic processing 2 
is applied to the output from the speech recognizer 
module which usually produces a huge word-graph 
hypothesis. Thus the forest of syntactic trees pro- 
duced by this phase have been used to achieve two 
goals: 
1." The n-best analyses are used to disambiguate 
speech recognizer hypotheses 
2. They served as supplementary input for the ro- 
bust semantic analysis that we performed, that 
had as goal the production of query frames for 
the information system? 
Although robustness can be considered as being ap- 
plied at either a syntactic or semantic level, we be- 
lieve it is generally at the semantic level that it is 
most effective. This robust analysis needs a model 
of the domain in which the system operates, and 
a way of linking this model to the lexicon used by 
the other components. The degree of detail required 
of the domain model used by the robust analyzer 
SOur partner institution ISSCO (Institute Dalle Molle, 
University of Geneva) performed this analysis phase using 
tools that were developed in the European Linguistics En- 
gineering project MULTEXT. For syntactic analysis, ISSCO 
developed a Feature Unification Grammar based on a small 
sample of the Polyphone data. This grammar was taken by 
another of our partners (the Laboratory for Artificial Intel- 
ligence of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lau- 
sanne) and converted into a probabilistic ontext-free gram- 
mar, which was then applied to a sample of 500 entries from 
the Polyphone data. 
depends upon the ultimate task that must be per- 
formed - -  in our case, furnishing a query to an infor- 
mation system. The results of the processing phase 
of the previous example is represented below as an 
SGML annotation: 
<announce> 
Bonjour j'aimerais un 
</announce> 
<query> num~ro de t~l@phone ~ Saignelegier 
<name> 
<ram_name> c~est Mottaz m o deux ta z 
</f am_name> 
<first_name> Monique </first_name> 
</name> 
<address> 
<street> rue  du  printemps </street> 
<number> num~ro quatre </number> 
<city> </city> 
</address> 
</query> 
2 Methodo logy  
In this section we propose the use of a "light-parser" 
for doing sentence-level semantic annotation? The 
main idea comes from the observation that annota- 
tion does not always need to rely on the deep struc- 
ture of the sentence (e.g. at morpho-syntactic level). 
It is sometimes ufficient to find some cue-words 
which allow us to locate the logical sub-structures 
of the sentence? If the domain is simple enough, this 
task can be easily mechanized. A similar approach, 
using finite state parsing technology, has been pro- 
posed by Grefenstette in (Grefenstette, 1996) where 
the main applications are slanted to the extraction 
of syntactic information? 
2.1 Robust  Def in i te  C lause Grammars  
LHIP (Left-corner Head-driven Island Parser) (Bal- 
lim and Russell, 1994; Lieske and Ballim, 1998) is a 
system which performs robust analysis of its input, 
using a grammar defined in an extended form of the 
PROLOG Definite Clause Grammars (DCGs). The 
chief modifications to the standard PROLOG 'gram- 
mar rule' format are of two types: one or more right- 
hand side (RHS) items may be marked as 'heads' 
(e.g. using a leading '*'), and one or more RHS items 
may be marked as 'ignorable' (e.g. using a leading 
'-'). LHIP employs a different control strategy from 
that used by PROLOG DCGs, in order to allow it to 
cope with ungrammatical or unforeseen i put? The 
behavior of LHIP can best be understood in terms 
of the complementary notions of span and cover? 
A grammar ule is said to produce an island which 
spans input terminals ti to ti+,~ if the island starts 
at the i ~h terminal, and the i + n th terminal is the 
terminal immediately to the right of the last termi- 
nal of the island? A rule is said to cover m items 
if m terminals are consumed in the span of the rule. 
20 
Thus m < n. If m = n then the rule has completely 
covered the span. As implied here, rules need not 
cover all of the input in order to succeed. 
2.1.1 Weighted  LH IP  ru les 
The main goal of introducing weights into LHIP 
rules is to induce a partial order over the generated 
hypotheses. The following schema illustrate how to 
build a simple weighted rule in a compositional fash- 
ion where the resulting weight is computed from 
the sub-constituents u ing the minimum operator. 
Weights are real numbers in the interval \[0, 1\]. 
cat (cat (Hyp) ,Weight )  "~> 
sub_cat l (H l ,Wl ) ,  
? . . ~  
sub_catn(Hn,Wn), 
{app_list(\[Hl . . . . .  Hn\],Hyp), 
min_list(\[Wl ..... Wn\] ,Weight)}. 
This strategy is not the only possible since the LHIP 
formalism allows a greater flexibility. Without en- 
tering into formal details we can observe that if we 
strictly follow the above schema and we impose a 
cover threshold of 1 we are dealing with fuzzy DCG 
grammars (Lee and Zadeh, 1969; Asveld, 1996). We 
actually extend this class of grammars with a no- 
tion of fuzzy-robustness where weights are used to 
compute confidence factors for the membership of is- 
lands to categories 3. The order of constituents may 
play an important role in assigning weights for dif- 
ferent rules having the same number and type of 
constituents. Each LHIP rule returns a weight to- 
gether with a term'which will contribute to build 
the resulting structure. The confidence factor for a 
pre-terminal rule has been assigned statically on the 
basis of the rule designer's domain knowledge. 
2.2 The  methodo logy  at work  
In our case study we try to integrate the above prin- 
ciples in order to effectively compute annotation hy- 
potheses for the query generation task. This can 
be done by building a lattice of annotation hypothe- 
ses and possibly selecting the best one. This lattice 
is generated by means of a LHIP weighted gram- 
mar which is used to extract and assemble what 
we called semantic constituents. At the end of this 
process we presumably obtain suitable annotations 
from which we will able to extract the content of 
the query (e.g. name, address, city, etc.). The rules 
are designed taking into consideration the following 
kind of knowledge: 
Domain  Knowledge is exploited to provide quan- 
titative support (or confidence factor) to our 
rules. 
3Development of this notion is currently under investiga- 
tion and not yet formalized. 
Linguist ic  Knowledge (as for instance previous 
POS tagging or syntactic analysis) is used for 
determining constraints in order to prune the 
hypotheses space. 
Lexical  knowledge:  As pointed out in (Basili 
and M.T., 1997), lexical knowledge plays an im- 
portant role in Information Extraction since it can 
contribute in guiding the analysis process at various 
linguistic level. In our case we are concerned with 
lexical knowledge when we need to specify lexical 
LHIP rules which represent the building blocks of 
our parsing system. Semantic markers are domain- 
dependent word patterns and must be defined for 
a given corpus. They identify cue-words serving 
both as separators among logical subparts of the 
same sentence and as introducers of semantic con- 
stituents. In our specific ase they allow us to search 
for the content of the query only in interesting parts 
of the sentence. One of the most important sep- 
arators is the announcement-query separator. The 
LHIP clauses defining this separator can be one or 
more words covering rule like for instance: 
ann_query_separator ( IX\] ,0.7) #I. 0 "'> 
~terminal (X) , 
{X=' t~l~pbone ' }. 
ann_query_separator(\[X,Y\], i) #I.0 "~> 
~terminal (X), 
?terminal (Y), 
{\[X = 'num4ro*,Y = 'de'\]}. 
As an example of semantic onstituents introducers 
we propose here the follo~;ing rule: 
street_intro(\[T,Prep\] ,I) #I.0 "'> 
* street_type(T), 
preposition (Prep). 
which make use of some word knowledge about street 
types coming from an external thesaurus like: 
street_type(X) "'> 
?terminal (X), 
{thesaurus (street, W),member (X, N) }. 
It should be noted that we mix weighted and non- 
weighted rules, simply because non-weighted rules 
are rules with the highest weight 1. 
2.2.1 Generat ion  of  hypotheses  
The generation of annotation hypotheses is per- 
formed by: composing weighted rules, assembling 
constituents and filtering possible hypotheses. In 
this case the grammar should provide a means to 
provide an empty constituent when all possible hy- 
pothesis rules have failed. The highest level con- 
stituent is represented by the whole sentence struc- 
ture which simply specifies the possible orders of 
constituents relative to annotation hypotheses. 
21 
s(s(\[Ann,Query\]), W) - '> 
ann(Ann), 
query(Query,W2). 
ann(ann(Ann)) "-> closK(word(Ann)). 
query(query(Q) ,W) "'> 
* ann_query_separator (qSep, W1), 
target (Target, W2), 
address (Addr,W3) 
{app_list ( \[Qsep, \[Target\], 
\[Addr\] \ ,  Q), 
rain_list ( \[Wl,W2, W3\] ,W) }. 
In the ann rule we have made use of the Kleene 
closure operator closK which allow LHIP to sim- 
ply formulate regular expressions. In the query rule 
we have specified a possible order of constituents in- 
terleaved by semantic markers (e.g. separators and 
introducers). In this case we did not provide any lin- 
guistic constraint (e.g. preferring names belonging 
to the minimal common syntactic sub-tree or those 
having the longest sequence of proper names belong- 
ing to the same sub-tree). 
3 Conc lus ions  and  fu ture  works  
In this paper we summarized a proposal for a frame- 
work for designing grammar-based automated an- 
notation applications. Starting with a case study 
and following an approach which combines the no- 
tions of fuzziness and robustness in sentence parsing, 
we showed how to build practical domain-dependent 
rules which can be applied whenever it is possible to 
superimpose a sentence-level semantic structure to 
a text without relying on a previous deep syntacti- 
cal analysis. Even if the query generation problem 
may not seem a critical application one should bear 
in mind that the sentence processing must be done 
on-line. 
As we have previously seen, the cue-words used as 
semantic markers are domain-dependent. Even their 
relevance disposal and their weight within the rules 
depends on their linguistic usage. Therefore, a com- 
plete automatic annotation system based on the ap- 
proach proposed in this article seems to be adequate 
to give precise results. However, a semi-automatic 
system could satisfy our needs. This system should 
be based on the following techniques to achieve a 
high level of performance: 
1. For each annotation, the system offers a list 
of propositions based on standard grammars 
as well as on external knowledge (ontologies, 
knowledge bases ...) 
2. According to the grammar initially proposed, 
the user may change the annotation accord- 
ing to his needs. These modifications are held 
within the system to change the grammar ules 
as well as their weights. This makes the system 
interactive and enhanced by a learning phase. 
3. We could imagine that rule design process can 
be partially automated and we intend to pursue 
some research on developing methods for both 
assisted rule design and corpus based rule in- 
duction.
