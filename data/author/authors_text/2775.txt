Abstract 
With the supply of 8 closely interpreted 
dialectometrical maps, this paper analyses 
the linguistic change of the geolinguistic 
deep structures in Northern France (Do-
maine d?O?l)  between 1300 and 1900. As a 
matter of fact, the result will show ? with 
one exception ? the great stability of these 
deep structures.  
1 Introduction to the issue 
Through the comparison of two data sets of  1300 
and of 1900, the present contribution discusses, if 
and in which way the basic geolinguistic structure 
of Northern France (Domaine d?O?l) changed in 
the course of this period. In this investigation, a 
number of different methods of dialectometry 
(DM) will be applied. DM is a subdiscipline of 
quantitative linguistics which concentrates on the 
exploration of the actual deep geolinguistic structu-
res of a given space, using as data source linguistic 
atlases or similarly structured data collections 
(consisting of N inquiry points and p atlas or wor-
king maps). Of course, it has to be assumed that 
these deep structures were generated by a genuine 
specific activity of man (i.e of of the homo lo-
quens), that is to say: the ? linguistic (or dialectal) 
management of space by the homo loquens ?. Inso-
far as man has obviously many other opportunities 
of managing a given natural space besides the lin-
guistic management, there result many opportuni-
ties for interdisciplinary cooperation with DM. 
 
The Salzburg-based DM (Goebl 2006a) pursues 
the genuine principles of traditional (Romance) 
linguistic geography with quantitative means. It 
therefore defines its main aim in the empowering 
of the diagnostic virtue of traditional linguistic 
geography by introducing global or synthetic 
(quantitative) methods.  
 
2 Data basis 
It consists of two machine-readable data matrices, 
the first resuming the period around 1300, the 
other one resuming the period around 1900. 
2.1 Corpus 1300 (drawn from Dees 1980) 
The medieval corpus was borrowed from the scrip-
ta-atlas (1980) of the Amsterdam Romance linguist 
A. Dees. This atlas is based on the comprehensive  
interpretation of 3300 original charters of Northern 
France of the second half of the 13th century, 
which were analysed in that instance according to a 
list of ca. 300 written (or scripta-) attributes. These 
scripta-attributes are mainly of phonetic relevance, 
most of them referring to vocalism (189 attributes), 
but also to consonantism (87 attributes), and some 
of them even to morphology (22 attributes). As a 
result, the data matrix holds 298 attributes and 85 
? inquiry points ?. The latter correspond actually to 
scripta-centres (scriptoria, chanceries) which are 
distributed as evenly as possible all over the Do-
maine d?O?l. For the measuring of the graphic va-
riation in the 3300 charters, A. Dees developped a 
specific method. As a result, he was able to deter-
mine ? for each single attribute ? its relative occur-
rence (in percentage) in the charters of the 85 
75
  
scripta-centres.  The content of the data matrix lies 
therefore on a metrical scale.  
 
In the ninetees, A. Dees and his collaborator Piet 
von Reenen handed me over this data matrix, as a 
basis which allowed me to realize many dialecto-
metrical experiments. Its only disadvantage is that 
the machine-readable matrix holds less attributes 
(268) than the printed atlas (298). Nevertheless, by 
applying the ? Average Euclidean Metric ? 
(AEM), the ? Average Manhattan Metric ? (AMM) 
and the ? Bravais-Pearson correlation coefficent ? 
[r(BP)], the dialectometrical results are very profi-
table (see Goebl 2006b). The scripta-atlas publis-
hed by Dees in 1980 shows quantitative visualisa-
tions of the spatial distribution of the 298 attribu-
tes, but does not encompass global data interpreta-
tion with dialectometrical (or similar) methods. 
 
2.1.1 The Dees-data: one illustrative example 
In his scripta-atlas (1980: carte 87, p. 93), A. Dees 
also investigated the regional variation in the spel-
ling of the French possessive pronoun: leur, leurs, 
leurz etc. which are all derived from the Latin ety-
mon ILL?RU. Most probably they were created 
under the influence of a specific regional dialect 
pronunciation. At the end of the 13th century, the 
geographic contrast between these eu-spellings and 
the older equivalent forms lor, lors, lors etc. was 
quite sharp in the Domaine d?O?l. Hence, Dees 
checked the number of all occurrences of eu-
spellings (belonging to the possessive pronoun) in 
the 3300 above mentioned charters and listed, for 
each of the 85 scripta-centres of his atlas, the per-
centages of those charters which show at least one 
occurence of the spelling -eu-. As a result, 81 out 
of the 93 charters of the scripta-region 26 
? Somme, Pas-de-Calais ? (located in the medieval 
Artois: see the top of the figures 1, 3, 5 and 7) 
showed a considerable amount of eu-spellings, un-
like the remaining 12 charters. In the 105 charters 
of the scripta-region 1 ? Charente, Charente-
Maritime ? (South-western corner of the Domaine 
d?O?l), no occurrences of the eu-spellings were 
found. Obviously, the different spellings of the 
possessive pronoun in that region were still on -o-. 
Thus, Dees registered the value 87% (= 81 : 93) for 
the scripta-region 26 in the North and the value 0% 
for the scripta-region 1 in the South-west. 
 
As Dees analysed 298 scripta-features in the same 
way, he succeeded in covering the whole range of 
the stressed and unstressed vocalism and conso-
nantism of Old French. 
 
2.2 Corpus 1900 (drawn from ALF) 
The second corpus, referring to 1900, was drawn 
from the data of the French linguistic atlas ALF, 
precisely: from a data matrix which had been esta-
blished in the process of dialectometrization of the 
total ALF grid. The dimensions of this data matrix 
are: N = 641 inquiry points (distributed all over 
France), p = 1687 working maps, 1117 referring to 
phonetics (612 to vocalism, and 505 to consonan-
tism), 417 referring to vocabulary, and 99 to mor-
phology. 347 inquiry points (out of the 641 points 
on the total ALF grid) are located in Northern 
France : they represent therefore the Domaine 
d?O?l. Among these 347 inquiry points, 85 points 
were selected in geographic correspondance to the 
85 scripta-centres of the Dees-atlas, and subse-
quently reunited to a new grid (see the right halves 
of Maps 1-8). 
 
Among the 1687 workings maps mentioned above, 
we took only into consideration those of phonetic 
relevance, thus: 1117 maps. They derived from 
247 original maps of the ALF by phonetic typiza-
tion, which is a common procedure in Romance 
linguistics. The units of this ALF data matrix are 
upon the nominal scale. With the supply of the 
? Weighted Identity Value (with the weight 1) ? 
[WIV (1)], the dialectometrical interpretation of 
this data matrix proved to be very successful (see 
Goebl 1984, I: 83-86, and 2006a: 418-419). 
 
2.2.1 The ALF-data : two illustrative examples  
An example for two characteristic phonetic featu-
res is given in Map 812 of the ALF le march? ? the 
market ?. The 85 occurrences in the Domaine 
d?O?l all derive from the Latin etymon MERC?-
TU. The different dialectal followers of the 
stressed ? which is considered in this instance 
show the following results: a) pronunciation with -i 
(19 ALF-points), b) with (closed) -? (60 ALF-
points), c) with (open) -? (1 ALF-point), d) with -? 
(4 ALF-points), e) with (neutral) -e (1 ALF-point). 
From the metrological point of view, these five 
phonetic types represent what is called ? (nominal) 
76
  
multistate characters ?. As the corresponding wor-
king map contains five different (phonetic) types 
(or ? taxates ? in Salzburg terminology), it is called 
as well a ? 5-nymic working map ?. 
 
Nevertheless, the data of the same ALF-map can 
also be analysed according to consonantal princi-
ples, which is realized by listing the dialectal re-
sults of the postconsonantal C before stressed ? in 
MERC?TU. The results are as follows: a) ? (72 
ALF-points), b) ?y (2), c) ts (1), d) t?y (3), e) k (2), 
f) t? (3), g) ky (1), h) ty (1). On the map, these eight 
consonantal types show a geographic distribution 
which is far from being similar to the former one 
of the five vocalic types. Actually, this experience 
is also valid for the great majority of our ALF-
working maps. 
 
The reduced data matrix drawn from the integral 
ALF-grid (with 1687 working maps) consists of 
914 working maps: it starts with 2-nymic maps and 
has up to 23-nymic maps, embracing a total of 
4263 phonetic types or ? taxates ?. 
3 Establishement of the dialectometrical 
maps 
DM is a map-based discipline: It visualises sys-
tematically all its results by using previously de-
fined cartographic standards and by a very hand-
some computer program called VDM (? Visual 
DialectoMetry ?), which supports and resets these 
visualisations perfectly. With VDM, choropleth 
maps and isarithmic maps, as well as trees can be 
generated. The results are always mapped in col-
ours that are ranged according to the solar (or rain-
bow) spectrum, the warm colours lying above the 
arithmetic means of the respective frequency dis-
tribution, and the cold colours below it. The trees 
are all ? spatialized ? in principle, which means 
that their structural information is projected di-
rectly from the tree on the map. 
 
The comparison between the medieval versus the 
modern data occurs basically in visual form, a me-
thodically correct procedure, as the two corre-
sponding iconic patterns are established according 
to the same cartographic norms. Further, the re-
spective frequency distributions may also be corre-
lated in order to gain a correlation map. For rea-
sons of space, this procedure will not be demon-
strated in this paper.  
 
All the maps shown in section 4 are taken from 
two square similarity matrices (N x N) consisting 
of 85 items (N = 85), calculated by means of spe-
cial similarity indexes ? AEM and WIV(1) ? on 
the basis of two data matrices (N = 85 ; p1300 = 268 
metrical attributes, p1900 = 1117 nominal attrib-
utes). Hence, this demonstration includes two simi-
larity maps, two parameter maps, two interpoint 
maps and two trees (with the respective spatializa-
tions). These four comparison planes are actually 
of special relevance, by allowing a global compari-
son which is also precise to the last detail of the 
medieval versus the modern data. 
4 Four comparison planes between 1300 
and 1900 
4.1 Comparison plane 1 : two similarity maps 
The most important instrument of DM is the simi-
larity map. Each similarity map consists of a refer-
ence point and N-1 similarity values distributed in 
space, which values decrease proportionally with 
their geographical distance from the reference 
point. The geographic pattern of the progressive 
drop of these measurement values is clearly shown 
with the cartographic means of DM. In Maps 1 and 
2, the reference point is located in the Poitou 
(South-west). The visual comparison of the two 
choropleth profiles shows their great similarity. 
The same effect occurs also from the remaining 84 
reference points. This means that the linguistic 
management of the Domaine d?O?l was very simi-
lar in the Middle Ages (through the linguistic ac-
tivity of the scribes) and in modern times (through 
the linguistic activity of the dialect speakers). It 
must be added that, generally speaking, medieval 
non-Latin charters of the 13th and the 14th centu-
ries (mainly) had a strong dialectal colouring, a 
phenomenon which was noted not in France only, 
they showed therefore a great number of local 
and/or regional written attributes. In the 19th cen-
tury already, it was assumed  that this graph(et)ic 
variation was generated or at least partly caused by 
the oral variation of the different medieval dialects. 
In Northern France, this regional colouring of the 
charters decreases rapidly after ca. 1400, and van-
ishes after 1450.

4.2 Comparison plane 2 : two parameter-
maps : synopsis of the skewness values 
Maps 3 and 4 reveal an entirely different question. 
The synopsis (or combination) of the N skewness 
values of a given similarity matrix indicates the 
degree of variation between different regions in 
regard to the so-called ? linguistic compromise or 
exchange ?. This phenomenon is defined as the 
degree of the intermixing of geolinguistic attributes 
with (respectively) regionally varying extension 
and/or intensity. Our DM-classification distinguis-
hes therefore zones of high linguistic compromise 
(here : clear shadings) and zones of weak linguistic 
compromise (here : dark shadings). Where this lin-
guistic exchange is high or great, a strong linguis-
tic intermixing is prevailing. Where it is weak, the 
linguistic interaction is also low: these areas went 
on keeping a strong linguistic autonomy and were 
not yet seized by the general intermixing. 
 
In Map 3 (left), the zones of high linguistic com-
promise or exchange form a kind of cross: they are 
located in the centre of the Domaine d?O?l, whe-
reas on its peripherical boarders the areas of diffe-
rent historical provinces (such as: Normandy, Pi-
cardy, Lorraine, etc.) are found. In Map 4 (right), 
the clear shaded zone occupies now the main part 
of the grid of the Domaine d?O?l: in comparison 
with the left map it has virtually ? exploded ? (note 
the black circle), as a consequence of the conti-
nuous expansion of the language type of the Ile-de-
France, which had been strongly supported by the 
French kings and after 1789 also by the Republic. 
Only on the Eastern peripherical boarders, some 
provinces (Picardy, the Walloons, Lorraine, etc.) 
could elude the general language compromise and 
thus the general linguistic intermixing. 
 
Both maps consist of respectively 85 skewness 
values which were gained by respectively 85 simi-
larity distributions. Since almost 20 years, it is 
well-known that the skewness value is an excellent 
instrument for measuring language compromise or 
exchange; in many instances, evidence of this fact 
has been given with different data sets (see Goebl 
1984, I: 150-153, and 2006a: 419-420). 
4.3 Comparison plane 3 : two interpoint or 
honeycomb maps 
Actually, Maps 5 and 6 represent two honeycomb 
maps, each of them consisting of 225 polygon si-
des which vary according to thickness and dark-
ness. Every one of these polygon sides lies bet-
ween (= inter) contiguous inquiry points (hence the 
name interpoint map), and indicates virtually the 
relative dialectal differences. Instead of the linguis-
tic similarities (sim), the potential linguistic diffe-
rences or distances (dist) were mapped. In quanti-
tative regard, they are interrelated according to the 
formula: dist + sim = 100. Thus, the distance re-
lated counterpart of the above mentioned similarity 
index WIV(1) is the WDV (1) (? Weighted Dis-
tance Value (with the weight 1)) ?. 
 
The cartographic message of the two maps largely 
corresponds to the evidence of the traditional iso-
gloss syntheses which were commonly established 
during the 20th century in Romance, German and 
English linguistics. The thick (and dark) polygon 
sides represent the so called ? linguistic bounda-
ries?, a linguistic term which is rather colloquial 
and imprecise. One clearly recognizes that in Map 
5 (left) in the North (Picardy) and the South-west 
(Poitou, Saintonge) there are very prominent and 
distinct ? boundaries ?. But it also shows very 
clearly in Map 6 (right) that in the period between 
1300 and 1900 these ? boundaries ? were moved to 
the North (and East) as well as to the utmost bor-
ders of the South by an ? invisible force ? and that 
a zone with only very weak interpunctual demarca-
tions emerged in the middle of the Domaine d?O?l.  
Our knowledge of the history of the French lan-
guage allows us to identify this ? invisible force ?: 
it is the irradiation of the linguistic type of the Ile-
de-France, pushed by the politics. 
4.4 Comparison plane 4: two dendrographic 
analyses (following Ward?s method) 
Moreover, the two similarity matrices can first be 
processed by dendrographic methods, in a next 
step, the two trees are compared. In this procedure, 
one has to pay attention to those bifurcations of the 
tree which are located near the trunk (or the root). 
Among the relevant ? hierarchic agglomerative 
methods ? applied for the generation of trees, 
Ward?s method has proved to be most appropriate. 
In Maps 7 and 8, the tree and the map were drawn 
78
  
and visualised, isolating thereby (respectively) 
three distinct cartographic clusters. These clusters 
are called ? dendremes ? in the tree, and their cor-
respondences on the map ? choremes ?. The heu-
ristic comparison of Maps 7 and 8 concentrates on 
the position of the dendremes in the tree and simul-
taneously on the position of the choremes on the 
map. First, the perfect spatial coherence of all cho-
remes is striking. Further, it clearly results that the 
three dendremes (No. 1-3) at the top seize the East, 
the North and the Centre (including the West) of 
the Domaine d?O?l, though in such a way that the 
central dendreme-choreme (No. 1) expanded in the 
course of the six centuries between 1300 and 1900 
at the expense of the Eastern (No. 3) and the Nor-
thern (No. 2) choreme-dendreme. Again, this is a 
consequence of the irradiation of the dialect of the 
Ile-de-France, supported by the French royal dy-
nasty and the Republic. 
 
5 Final remarks  
By the visual comparison of four pairs of maps 
established with dialectometrical methods, evi-
dence was given that the geolinguistic deep struc-
tures of the Domaine d?O?l (Northern France) ? in 
the period between 1300 and 1900 ? maintained a 
large stability, that is to say : remained mostly 
identical in regard to their phonetics. Hence the 
question arises on determining the chronological 
development and elaboration before 1300 of  these 
phonetic deep structures. Nevertheless, the present 
investigation revealed the actual expansion of the 
linguistic type of the Ile-de-France between 1300 
and 1900 which represents the typological basis for 
standard French. The dialectometrical techniques, 
which were again applied in this contribution, have 
proven many times their great diagnostic value in 
the last three decades.
