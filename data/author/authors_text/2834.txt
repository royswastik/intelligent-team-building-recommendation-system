Current spoken dialogue systems are deficient in 
their strategies for preventing, identifying and re- 
pairing problems that arise in the conversation. This 
paper reports results on learning to automatically 
identify and predict problematic human-computer 
dialogues in a corpus of 4774 dialogues collected with 
the How May I Help You spoken dialogue system. 
Our expectation is that the ability to predict prob- 
lematic dialogues will allow the system's dialogue 
manager to modify its behavior to repair problems, 
and even perhaps, to prevent them. We train a 
problematic dialogue classifier using automatically- 
obtainable features that can identify problematic 
dialogues ignificantly better (23%) than the base- 
line. A classifier trained with only automatic fea- 
tures from the first exchange in the dialogue can 
predict problematic dialogues 7% more accurately 
than the baseline, and one trained with automatic 
features from the first two exchanges can perform 
14% better than the baseline. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Spoken dialogue systems promise fficient and nat- 
ural access to a large variety of information sources 
and services from any phone. Systems that sup- 
port short utterances to select a particular function 
(through a statement such as "Say credit card, col- 
lect or person-to-person") are saving companies mil- 
lions of dollars. Research prototypes exist for appli- 
cations uch as personal email and calendars, travel 
and restaurant information, and personal banking 
(Baggia et al, 1998; Walker et al, 1998; Seneff et 
al., 1995; Sanderman et al, 1998; Chu-Carroll and 
Carpenter, 1999) inter alia. Yet there are still many 
research challenges: current systems are limited in 
the interaction they support and brittle in many re- 
spects. We show how spoken dialogue systems can 
learn to support more natural interaction on the ba- 
sis of their previous experience. 
One way that current spoken dialogue systems are 
quite limited is in their strategies for detecting and 
repairing problems that arise in conversation. If 
a problem can be detected, the system can either 
transfer the call to a human operator or modify its 
dialogue strategy in an attempt to repair the prob- 
lem. We can train systems to improve their ability to 
detect problems by exploiting dialogues collected in 
interactions with human users. The initial segments 
of these dialogues can be used to predict hat a prob- 
lem is likely to occur. We expect hat the ability to 
predict that a dialogue is likely to be problematic 
will allow the system's dialogue manager to apply 
more sophisticated strategies to repairing problems, 
and even perhaps, to prevent hem. 
This paper reports experiments on predicting 
problems in spoken dialogue interaction by train- 
ing a problematic dialogue predictor on a corpus of 
4774 dialogues collected in an experimental trial of 
AT~;T's How May I Help You (HMIHY) spoken dia- 
logue system (Gorin et al, 1997; Riccardi and Gorin, 
to appear; E. Ammicht and Alonso, 1999). In this 
trial, the HMIHY system was installed at an AT&T 
customer care center. HMIHY answered calls from 
live customer traffic and successfully automated a 
large number of customer requests. An example of 
a dialogue that HMIHY completed successfully is
shown in Figure 13

in detail below, which we consider problematic.

This paper reports results from a set of experi- 
ments that test whether we can learn to automat- 
ically predict that a dialogue will be problematic 
on the basis of information the system has: (1) 
early on in the dialogue; and (2) in real time. We 
train an automatic lassifer for predicting problem- 
atic dialogues from features that can be automat- 
ically extracted from the HMIHY corpus. The re- 
sults show that we can learn to predict problematic 
dialogues using fully automatic features with an ac- 
curacy ranging from 72% to 87%, depending on how 
much of the dialogue the system has seen so far. 
Section 2 describes HMIHY and the dialogue corpus 
which the experiments are based on. Section 3 de- 
tails the encoding of the dialogues and the methods 
used for utilizing the machine learning program RIP- 
PER to train an automatic problematic dialogue pre- 
dictor (Cohen, 1996). Section 4 presents the results 
and section 5 summarizes the paper and describes 
future work. 
2 Exper imenta l  Sys tem and Data  
HMIHY is a spoken dialogue system based on the no- 
tion of call routing (Gorin et al, 1997; Chu-Carroll 
and Carpenter, 1999). In the HMIHY call rout- 
ing system, services that the user can access are 
classified into 14 categories, plus a category called 
other for calls that cannot be automated and must 
be transferred to a human operator (Gorin et al, 
1997). ~ Each category describes a different task, 
such as person-to-person dialing, or receiving credit 
for a misdialed number. The system determines 
which task the caller is requesting on the basis of 
its understanding of the cMler's response to the 
open-ended system greeting A T~ T, How May I Help 
You?. Once the task has been determined, the infor- 
mation needed for completing the caller's request is 
obtained using dialogue submodules that are specific 
for each task (Abella and Gorin, 1999). 
In addition to the TASKSUCCESS dialogues in 
which HMIHY successfully automates the cus- 
tomer's call, illustrated in Figure 1, and the calls 
that are transferred to a human operator, there are 
three other possible outcomes for a call, all of which 
are problematic. The first category, which we call 
HANGUP, results from a customer's decision to hang 
up on the system. A sample HANGUP dialogue is 
in Figure 2. A caller may hang up because s/he is 
frustrated with the system; our goal is to learn from 
the corpus which system behaviors led to the caller's 
frustration. 
The second problematic ategory (WIZARD), re- 
suits from a human customer care agent's decision to 
take over the call from the system. Because HMIHY 
is experimental, each call was monitored by a human 
2 One potential use of our results is to provide better ules 
for making the transfer decision.

system. There were a number of agents who partici- 
pated as wizards during the trial of HMIHY and each 
wizard was simply told to take over the call if s/he 
perceived problems with the system's performance. 
The wizard's decision was logged by the experimen- 
tal setup, resulting in labelling the call as one that 
the wizard took over. s A dialogue where the wizard 
decided that the dialogue was problematic and took 
over the call is shown in Figure 3.

WIZARD STEPS IN 
Figure 3: Sample WIZARD Dialogue 
The third problematic category, the TASKFAILURE 
dialogues, are cases where the system completed the 
call, but carried out a task that was not the task 
that the customer was actually requesting. An ex- 
ample TASKFAILURE dialogue is given in Figure 4: 
HMIHY interpreted utterance U2 as a request to 
make a third-party call e.g. to bill it to my home 
phone. HMIHY then asked the caller for the infor- 
mation it needed to carry out this task, the caller 
complied, and the system completed the call. 
The corpus of 4774 dialogues used in our exper- 
iments was collected in severM experimental trials 
of HMIHY on live customer traffic (Pdccardi and 
Gorin, to appear; E. Ammicht and Alonso, 1999), 
and is referred to as HM2 in (Riccardi and Gorin, to 
appear)). During the trial, all of the system behav- 
iors were automatically recorded in a log file, and 
later the dialogues were transcribed by humans and 
labelled with a semantic ategory representing the

the wizard to take over the call, but we assume that the wizard 
had good reason for doing so.

3 T ra in ing  an  Automat ic  
P rob lemat ic  D ia logue  Pred ic tor  
Our experiments apply the machine learning pro- 
gram RIPPER (Cohen, 1996) to automatically induce 
a "problematic dialogue" classification model. RIP- 
PER takes as input the names of a set of classes to 
be learned, the names and ranges of values of a fixed 
set of features, and training data specifying the class 
and feature values for each example in a training set. 
Its output is a classification model for predicting the 
class of future examples. In RIPPER, the classifica- 
tion model is learned using greedy search guided by 
an information gain metric, and is expressed as an 
ordered set of if-then rules. 
To apply RIPPER, the dialogues in the corpus must 
be encoded in terms of a set of classes (the output 
classification) and a set of input features that are 
used as predictors for the classes. We start with the 
dialogue categories described above, but since our 
goal is to develop algorithms that predict/identify 
problematic dialogues, we treat HANGUP, WIZARD 
and TASKFAILURE as equivalently problematic. Thus 
we train the classifier to distinguish between two 
classes: TASKSUCCESS and PROBLEMATIC. Note that 
our categorization is inherently noisy because we do 
not know the real reasons why a caller hangs up or a 
wizard takes over the call. The caller may hang up 
because she is frustrated with the system, or she may 
simply dislike automation, or her child may have 
started crying. Similarly, one wizard may have low 
confidence in the system's ability to recover from er- 
rors and use a conservative approach that results in 
taking over many calls, while another wizard may be 
more willing to let the system try to recover. Nev- 
ertheless we take these human actions as a human 
labelling of these calls as problematic. Given this 
classification, approximately 36% of the calls in the 
corpus of 4774 dialogues are PROBLEMATIC and 64% 
are TASKSUCCESS. 
Next, we encoded each dialogue in terms of a set 
of 196 features that were either automatically ogged 
by one of the system modules, hand-labelled by hu- 
mans, or derived from raw features. We use the 
hand-labelled features to produce a TOPLINE, an es- 
timation of how well a classifier could do that had 
access to perfect information. The entire feature set 
is summarized in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Features for spoken dialogues. 
There are 8 features that describe the whole dia- 
logue, and 47 features for each of the first four ex- 
changes. We encode features for the first four ex- 
changes because we want to predict failures before 
they happen. Since 97% of the dialogues in our cor- 
pus are five exchanges or less, in most cases, any 
potential problematic outcome will have occurred 
by the time the system has participated in five ex- 
changes. Because the system needs to be able to 
predict whether the dialogue will be problematic us- 
ing information it has available in the initial part of 
the dialogue, we train classifiers that only have ac- 
cess to input features from exchange 1, or only the 
features from exchange 1 and exchange 2. To see 
whether our results generalize, we also experiment 
with a subset of features that are task-independent. 
We compare results for predicting problematic din- 
212 
logues, with results for identifying problematic di- 
alogues, when the classifier has access to features 
representing the whole dialogue. 
We utilized features logged by the system because 
they are produced automatically, and thus could be 
used during runtime to alter the course of the dia- 
logue. The system modules that we collected infor- 
mation from were the acoustic processer/automatic 
speech recognizer (ASR) (Riccardi and Gorin, to ap- 
pear), the natural anguage understanding (NLU) 
module (Gorin et al, 1997), and the dialogue man- 
ager (DM) (Abella and Gorin, 1999). Below we de- 
scribe each module and the features obtained from 
it. 
ASR takes as input the acoustic signal and 
outputs a potentially errorful transcription of what 
it believes the caller said. The ASR features for 
each of the first four exchanges were the output 
of the speech recognizer (recog), the number of 
words in the recognizer output (recog-numwords), 
the duration in seconds of the input to the 
recognizer (asr-duration), a flag for touchtone 
input (dtmf-flag), the input modality expected 
by the recognizer (rg-modality) (one of: none, 
speech, touchtone, speech+touchtone, touchtone- 
card, speech+touchtone-card, touchtone-date, 
speech+touchtone-date, or none-final-prompt), and 
the grammar used by the recognizer (rg-grammar). 
The motivation for the ASR features is that any 
one of them may have impacted performance. For 
example, it is well known that longer utterances 
are less likely to be recognized correctly, thus asr- 
duration could be a clue to incorrect recognition re- 
suits. In addition, the larger the grammar is, the 
more likely an ASR error is, so the name of the 
grammar vg-grammar could be a predictor of incor- 
rect recognition. 
The natural language understanding (NLU) mod- 
ule takes as input a transcription ofthe user's utter- 
ance from ASR and produces 15 confidence scores 
representing the likelihood that the caller's task is 
one of the 15 task types. It also extracts other 
relevant information, such as phone or credit card 
numbers. Thus 15 of the NLU features for each ex- 
change represent the 15 confidence scores. There 
are also features that the NLU module calculates 
based on processing the utterance. These include 
an intra-utterance measure of the inconsistency be- 
tween tasks that the user appears to be requesting 
(inconsistency), a measure of the coverage of the 
utterance by salient grammar fragments (salience- 
coverage), a measure of the shift in context between 
utterances (context-shift), he task with the highest 
confidence score (top-task), the task with the second 
highest confidence score (nexttop-task), the value of 
the highest confidence score (top-confidence), and 
the difference in values between the top and next- 
to-top confidence scores (diff-confidence). 
The motivation for these NLU features i  to make 
use of information that the NLU module has based 
on processing the output of ASR and the current dis- 
course context. For example, for utterances that fol- 
low the first utterance, the NLU module knows what 
task it believes the caller is trying to complete. If it 
appears that the caller has changed her mind, then 
the NLU module may have misunderstood a previ- 
ous utterance. The context-shift feature indicates 
the NLU module's belief that it may have made an 
error (or be making one now). 
The dialogue manager (DM) takes the output of 
NLU and the dialogue history and decides what it 
should say to the caller next. It decides whether it 
believes there is a single unambiguous task that the 
user is trying to accomplish, and how to resolve any 
ambiguity. The DM features for each of the first four 
exchanges are the task-type label which includes a 
label that indicates task ambiguity (sys-label), utter- 
ance id within the dialogue (implicit in the encod- 
ing), the name of the prompt played before the user 
utterance (prompt), and whether that prompt was a 
reprompt (reprompt), a confirmation (confirm), or a 
subdialogue prompt (subdia O, a superset of the re- 
prompts and confirmation prompts. 
The DM features are primarily motivated by pre- 
vious work. The task-type label feature is to cap- 
ture the fact that some tasks may be harder than 
others. The utterance id feature is motivated by the 
idea that the length of the dialogue may be impor- 
tant, possibly in combination with other features like 
task-type. The different prompt features for initial 
prompts, reprompts, confirmation prompts and sub- 
dialogue prompts are motivated by results indicating 
that reprompts and confirmation prompts are frus- 
trating for callers and that callers are likely to hy- 
perarticulate when they have to repeat hemselves, 
which results in ASR errors (Shriberg et al, 1992; 
Levow, 1998). 
The DM features also include running tallies for 
the number of reprompts (num-reprompts), number 
of confirmation prompts (num.confirms), and num- 
ber of subdialogue prompts (num-subdials), that had 
been played up to each point in the diMogue, as well 
as running percentages (percent-reprompts, ercent- 
confirms, percent-subdials). The use of running tal- 
lies and percentages is based on the assumption that 
these features are likely to produce generalized pre- 
dictors (Litman et al, 1999). 
The features obtained via hand-labelling were hu- 
man transcripts of each user utterance (tscript), a 
set of semantic labels that are closely related to the 
system task-type labels (human-label), age (age) and 
gender (gender) of the user, the actual modality of 
the user utterance (user-modality) (one of: nothing, 
speech, touchtone, speech+touchtone, on-speech), 
213 
and a cleaned transcript with non-word noise infor- 
mation removed (clean-tscript). From these features 
we calculated two derived features. The first was the 
number of words in the cleaned transcript (cltscript 
numwords), again on the assumption that utterance 
length is strongly correlated with ASR and NLU er- 
rors. The second derived feature was based on cal- 
culating whether the human-label matches the sys- 
label from the dialogue manager (rsuccess). There 
were four values for rsuccess: rcorrect, rmismatch, 
rpartial-match and rvacuous-match, indicating re- 
spectively correct understanding, incorrect under- 
standing, partial understanding, and the fact that 
there had been no input for ASR and NLU to oper- 
ate on, either because the user didn't say anything 
or because she used touch-tone. 
The whole-dialogue f atures derived from the per- 
utterance features were: num-utts, num-reprompts, 
percent-reprampts, hum.confirms, percent-confirms, 
num-subdials, and per-cent-subdials for the whole di- 
alogue, and the duration of the entire dialogue in 
seconds (dial-duration). 
In the experiments, the features in Figure 5 except 
the Hand-Labelled features are referred to as the AU- 
TOMATIC feature set. We examine how well we can 
identify or predict problematic dialogues using these 
features, compared to the full feature set including 
the Hand-Labelled features. As mentioned earlier, 
we wish to generalize our problematic dialogue pre- 
dictor to other systems. Thus we also discuss how 
well we can predict problematic dialogues using only 
features that are both automatically acquirable dur- 
ing runtime and independent of the HMIHY task. 
The subset of features from Figure 5 that fit this 
qualification are in Figure 6. We refer to them as 
the AUTO, TASK-INDEP feature set. 
The output of each RIPPER. experiment is a clas- 
sification model learned from the training data. To 
evaluate these results, the error rates of the learned 
classification models are estimated using the resam- 
pling method of cross-validation. In 5-fold cross- 
validation, the total set of examples is randomly di- 
vided into 5 disjoint test sets, and 5 runs of the learn- 
ing program are performed. Thus, each run uses the 
examples not in the test set for training and the re- 
maining examples for testing. An estimated error 
rate is obtained by averaging the error rate on the 
testing portion of the data from each of the 5 runs. 
Since we intend to integrate the rules learned 
by RIPPER into the HMIHY system, we examine 
the precision and recall performance of specific hy- 
potheses. Because hypotheses from different cross- 
validation experiments cannot readily be combined 
together, we apply the hypothesis learned on one 
randomly selected training set (80% of the data) to 
that set's respective test data. Thus the precision 
and recall results reported below are somewhat less

4 Results 
We present results for both predicting and identi- 
fying problematic dialogues. Because we are inter- 
ested in predicting that a dialogue will be problem- 
atic at a point in the dialogue where the system can 
do something about it, we compare prediction ac- 
curacy after having only seen the first exchange of 
the diMogue with prediction accuracy after having 
seen the first two exchanges, with identification ac- 
curacy after having seen the whole dialogue. For 
each of these situations we also compare results for 
the AUTOMATIC and AUTO, TASK-INDEP feature sets 
(as described earlier), with results for the whole fea- 
ture set including hand-labelled features. Table 1 
summarizes the results. 
The baseline on the first line of Table 1 repre- 
sents the prediction accuracy from always guess- 
ing the majority class. Since 64% of the dialogues 
are TASKSUCCESS dialogues, we can achieve 64% ac- 
curacy from simply guessing TASKSUCCESS without 
having seen any of the dialogue yet. 
The first EXCHANGE 1 row shows the results of 
using the AUTOMATIC features from only the first 
exchange to predict whether the dialogue outcome 
will be TASKSUCCESS or PROBLEMATIC. The results 
show that the machine-learned classifier can predict 
problematic dialogues 8% better than the baseline 
after having seen only the first user utterance. Using 
only task-independent automatic features (Figure 6) 
the EXCHANGE 1 classifier can still do nearly as well. 
The ALL row for EXCHANGE 1 indicates that even 
if we had access to human perceptual ability (the 
hand-labelled features) we would still only be able 
to distinguish between TASKSUCCESS and PROBLEM- 
ATIC dialogues with 77% accuracy after having seen 
the first exchange.

The EXCHANGE l&2 rows of Table 1 show the re- 
suits using features from the first two exchanges in 
the dialogue to predict he outcome of the dialogue. 4 
The additional exchange gives roughly an additional 
7% boost in predictive accuracy using either of the 
AUTOMATIC feature sets. This is only 8% less than 
the accuracy we can achieve using these features af- 
ter having seen the whole dialogue (see below). The 
ALL row for EXCHANGE l&2 shows that we could 
achieve over 86% accuracy if we had the ability to 
utilize the hand-labelled features. 
The FULL DIALOGUE row in Table 1 for AUTO- 
MATIC and AUTO, TASK-INDEP features hows the 
ability of the classifier to identify problematic dia- 
logues, rather than predict them, using features for 
the whole dialogue. The ALL row for the FULL DI- 
ALOGUE shows that we could correctly identify over 
92% of the outcomes accurately if we had the ability 
to utilize the hand-labelled features. 
Note that the task-independent automatic fea- 
tures always perform within 2% error of the auto- 
matic features, and the hand-labelled features con- 
sistently perform with accuracies ranging from 6-8% 
greater. 
The rules that RIPPER learned on the basis of the 
Exchange 1 automatic features are below.

The second rule says that if the difference between 
the top confidence score and the second-ranked con- 
fidence score is moderate or low, and the duration 
of the user utterance is more than 7 seconds, predict 
PROBLEMATIC. 
The performance of these rules is summarized in
Table 2. These results show that given the first ex- 
change, this ruleset predicts that 22% of the dia- 
logues will be problematic, while 36% of them ac- 
tually will be. Of the dialogues that actually will 
be problematic, it can predict 41% of them. Once 
it predicts that a dialogue will be problematic, it is 
correct 69% of the time. As mentioned earlier, this 
reflects an overMl improvement in accuracy of 8% 
over the baseline. 
The rules learned by training on the automatic 
task-independent features for exchanges 1 and 2 are 
given below. As in the first rule set, the features that 
the classifier appears to be exploiting are primarily 
those from the ASR and NLU modules. 
Exchanges l&2, Automatic Task- 
Independent Features: 
i f  (e2-recog-numwords < 0) A (el-cliff-confidence < .95) 
then  problematic. 
if (el-salience-coverage < .889) A (e2-recog contains 
"I') A (e2-asr-duration > 7.48) then problematic. 
if (el-top-confidence < .924) A (e2-asr-duration >_ 5.36) 
A (el-asr-duration > 8.6) then problematic. 
if (e2-recog is blank) A (e2-asr-duration > 2.8) then 
problematic. 
if (el-salience-coverage < .737) A (el-recog contains 
"help") A (el-asr-duration < 7.04) then problematic. 
if (el-cliff-confidence < .924) A (el-dtmf-flag = '1') A 
(el-asr-duration < 6.68) then problematic. 
default is tasksuccess. 
The performance of this ruleset is summarized in
Table 3. These results show that, given the first 
two exchanges, this ruleset predicts that 26% of the

dialogues will be problematic, while 36% of them 
actually will be. Of the problematic dialogues, it 
can predict 57% of them. Once it predicts that a 
dialogue will be problematic, it is correct 79% of 
the time. Compared with the classifier for the first 
utterance alone, this classifier has an improvement 
of 16% in recall and 10% in precision, for an overall 
improvement in accuracy of 7% over using the first 
exchange alone. 
One observation from these hypotheses i  the clas- 
sifier's preference for the asr-duration feature over 
the feature for the number of words recognized 
(recog-numwords). One would expect longer utter- 
ances to be more difficult, but the learned rulesets 
indicate that duration is a better measure of utter- 
ance length than the number of words. Another ob- 
servation is the usefulness of the NLU confidence 
scores and the NLU salience-coverage in predicting 
problematic dialogues. These features eem to pro- 
vide good general indicators of the system's uccess 
in recognition and understanding. The fact that the 
main focus of the rules is detecting ASR and NLU 
errors and that none of the DM behaviors are used 
as predictors also indicates that, in all likelihood, the 
DM is performing as well as it can, given the noisy 
input that it is getting from ASR and NLU. 
To identify potential improvements in the prob- 
lematic dialogue predictor, we analyzed which hand- 
labelled features made large performance improve- 
ments, under the assumption that future work can 
focus on developing automatic features that ap- 
proximate the information provided by these hand- 
labelled features. The analysis indicated that the 
vsuceess feature alone improves the performance of 
the TOPLINE from 88.5%, as reported in (Langkilde 
et al, 1999), to 92.3%. Using rsuccess as the only 
feature results in 73.75% accuracy for exchange 1, 
81.9% accuracy for exchanges 18z2 and 85.3% accu- 
racy for the full dialogue. In addition, for Exchanges 
l&2, the accuracy of the AUTOMATIC, TASK-INDEP 
feature set plus the rsuccess feature is 86.5%, which 
is only 0.2% less than the accuracy of ALL the lea- 
tures for Exchanges l&2 as shown in Table 1. The 
rules that RIPPER learns for Exchanges 1&52 when 
the AUTOMATIC, TASK-INDEP feature set is aug- 
mented with the single hand-labelled rsuccess fea- 
ture is shown below.

Note that the rsuccess feature is frequently used in 
the rules and that RIPPER learns rules that combine 
the rsuccess feature with other features, such as the 
confidence, asr-duration, and salience-coverage fea- 
tures. 
5 D iscuss ion  and Future  Work  
In summary, our results show that: (1) All feature 
sets significantly improve over the baseline; (2) Us- 
ing automatic features from the whole dialogue, we 
can identify problematic dialogues 23% better than 
the baseline; (3) Just the first exchange provides ig- 
216 
nificantly better prediction (8%) than the baseline; 
(4) The second exchange provides an additional sig- 
nificant (7%) improvement, (5) A classifier based on 
task-independent automatic features performs with 
less than 1% degradation in error rate relative to 
the automatic features. Even with current accuracy 
rates, the improved ability to predict problematic 
dialogues means that it may be possible to field the 
system without human agent oversight, and we ex- 
pect to be able to improve these results. 
The research reported here is the first that we 
know of to automatically analyze a corpus of logs 
from a spoken dialogue system for the purpose of 
learning to predict problematic situations. Our work 
builds on earlier research on learning to identify di- 
alogues in which the user experienced poor speech 
recognizer performance (Litman et al, 1999). How- 
ever, that work was based on a much smaller set of 
experimental dialogues where the notion of a good or 
bad dialogue was automatically approximated rather 
than being labelled by humans. In addition, because 
that work was based on features ynthesized over the 
entire dialogues, the hypotheses that were learned 
could not be used for prediction during runtime. 
We are exploring several ways to improve the per- 
formance of and test the problematic dialogue pre- 
dictor. First, we noted above the extent to which 
the hand-labelled feature rsuccess improves classifier 
performance. In other work we report results from 
training an rsuccess classifier on a per-utterance level 
(Walker et al, 2000), where we show that we can 
achieve 85% accuracy using only fully automatic fea- 
tures. In future work we intend to use the (noisy) 
output from this classifier as input to our problem- 
atic dialogue classifier with the hope of improving 
the performance of the fully automatic feature sets. 
In addition, since it is more important o minimize 
errors in predicting PROBLEMATIC dialogues than er- 
rors in predicting TASKSUCCESS dialogues, we intend 
to experiment with RIPPER'S loss ratio parameter, 
which instructs RIPPER to achieve high accuracy for 
the PROBLEMATIC class, while potentially reducing 
overall accuracy. Finally, we plan to integrate the 
learned rulesets into the HMIHY dialogue system to 
improve the system's overall performance.
