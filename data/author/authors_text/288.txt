Abstract
Publishers  of  biomedical  journals  in-
creasingly  use  XML  as  the  underlying 
document format.  We present a modular 
text-processing pipeline that inserts XML 
markup  into  such  documents  in  every 
processing step, leading to multi-dimen-
sional markup.  The markup introduced 
is  used  to  identify  and  disambiguate 
named entities of several semantic types 
(protein/gene,  Gene  Ontology  terms, 
drugs  and species)  and to  communicate 
data from one module to the next.  Each 
module  independently  adds,  changes  or 
removes markup, which allows for mod-
ularization  and  a  flexible  setup  of  the 
processing  pipeline.  We  also  describe 
how the cascaded approach is embedded 
in  a  large-scale  XML-based  application 
(EBIMed) used for on-line access to bio-
medical  literature.   We discuss  the  les-
sons  learnt  so  far,  as  well  as  the  open 
problems  that  need  to  be  resolved.   In 
particular,  we  argue  that  the  pragmatic 
and tailored solutions allow for reduction 
in  the need for overlapping annotations 
? although not completely without cost.
1 Introduction
Publishers  of  biomedical  journals  have  widely 
adopted  XML  as  the  underlying  format  from 
which other formats,  such as PDF and HTML, 
are generated.  For example, documents in XML 
format are available from the National Library of 
Medicine1 (Medline abstracts and Pubmed2 Cent-
ral documents), and from BioMed Central3 (full 
text journal articles). Other publishers are head-
ing  into  the  same  direction.   Such  documents 
contain logical markup to organize meta-inform-

ation such as title, author(s), sections, headings, 
citations,  references,  etc.   Inside  the  text  of  a 
document,  XML is  used  for  physical  markup, 
e.g. text in italic or boldface, subscript and super-
script  insertions,  etc.   Manually  generated  se-
mantic markup is available only on the document 
level (e.g. MeSH terms).
One of the most distinguished feature of sci-
entific biomedical literature is that it contains a 
large amount of terms and entities, the majority 
of  which are explained in public electronic data-
bases. Terms (such as names of genes, proteins, 
gene products, organisms, drugs, chemical com-
pounds, etc.) are a key factor for accessing and 
integrating  the  information  stored  in  literature 
(Krauthammer  and  Nenadic,  2004).  Identifica-
tion  and  markup  of  names  and  terms  in  text 
serves several purposes:  
(1) The users profit from highlighted semantic 
types, e.g. protein/gene, drug, species, and from 
links to the defining database for immediate ac-
cess and exploration.
(2) Identified terms facilitate and improve stat-
istical and NLP based text analysis (Hirschman 
et al, 2005; Kirsch et al, 2005).  
In this paper we describe a cascaded approach 
to named-entity recognition (NER) and markup 
in biomedicine that is embedded into EBIMed4, 
an on-line service to access the literature (Reb-
holz-Schuhmann  et  al.,  forthcoming).  EBIMed 
facilitates  both  purposes  mentioned  above.   It 
keeps the annotations provided by publishers and 
inserts  XML  annotations  while  processing  the 
text.  Named entities from different resources are 
identified  in  the  text.  The  individual  modules 
provide annotation of protein names with unique 
identifiers, disambiguation of protein names that 
are  ambiguous  acronyms,  annotation  of  drugs, 
Gene Ontology5 terms and species.  The identi-
fication of protein named entities can be further 
used in an alternative pipeline to identify events

such as  protein-protein interactions  and associ-
ations between terms and mutations (Blaschke et 
al., 1999; Rzhetsky et al, 2004; Rebholz-Schuh-
mann  et  al.,  2004;  Nenadic  and  Ananiadou, 
2006).
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. 
In  Section  2  we  briefly  discuss  problems with 
biomedical NER.  The cascaded approach and an 
online text mining system are described in sec-
tions 3 and 4 respectively.  We discuss the les-
sons learnt from the on-line application and re-
mainig open problems in Section 5, while con-
clusions are presented in Section 6.
2 Biomedical Named Entity Recognition 
Terms and named-entities (NEs) are the means 
of scientific communication as they are used to 
identify  the  main  concepts  in  a  domain.  The 
identification  of  terminology in  the  biomedical 
literature is one of the most challenging research 
topics  both  in  the  NLP  and  biomedical  com-
munities (Hirschman et al,  2005; Kirsch et al, 
2005).
Identification  of  named  entities  (NEs)  in  a 
document can be viewed as a three-step proced-
ure (Krauthammer and Nenadic, 2004).  In the 
first step, single or multiple adjacent words that 
indicate the presence of domain concepts are re-
cognised (term recognition). In the second step, 
called  term categorisation, the recognised terms 
are classified into broader domain classes (e.g. as 
genes, proteins, species). The final step is  map-
ping of terms into referential databases. The first 
two steps are commonly referred to as named en-
tity recognition (NER).
One of the main challenges in NER is a huge 
number of new terms and entities that appear in 
the  biomedical  domain.  Further,  terminological 
variation, recognition of boundaries of multiword 
terms, identification of nested terms and ambigu-
ity of terms are the difficult issues when mapping 
terms from the literature to biomedical database 
entries  (Hirschman  et  al.,  2005;  Krauthammer 
and Nenadic, 2004). 
On one hand, NER in the biomedical domain 
(in particular  the recognition part)  profits  from 
large,  freely available terminological  resources, 
which  are  either  provided  as  ontologies  (e.g. 
Gene Ontology, ChEBI6, UMLS7) or result from 
biomedical  databases containing named entities 
(e.g.  UniProt/Swiss-Prot8).  On  the  other  hand, 
combining sets of terms from different termino-

2003).
logical resources leads to naming conflicts such 
as homonymous use of names and terminological 
ambiguities. The most obvious problem is when 
the same span of text is assigned to different se-
mantic types (e.g. ?rat? denotes a species and a 
protein). In this case, there are three types of am-
biguities:  
(Amb1) A name is used for different entries in 
the  same database,  e.g.  the  same protein name 
serves  for  a  given  protein  in  different  species 
(Chen et al, 2005).
(Amb2) A name is used for entries in multiple 
databases and thus represents different types, e.g. 
?rat? is a protein and a species.
(Amb3) A name is not only used as a biomed-
ical term but also as part of common English (in 
contrast  to  the  biomedical  terminology),  e.g. 
?who? and  ?how?,  which  are  used  as  protein 
names.
In some cases (i.e. Amb2), broader classifica-
tion can help to disambiguate between different 
entries  (e.g.  differentiate  between  ?CAT? as  a 
protein, animal or medical device). However, it 
is ineffective in situations where names can be 
mapped to several different entries in the same 
data  source.  In  such  situations,  disambiguation 
on the resource level is needed (see, for example, 
(Liu et al, 2002) for disambiguation of terms as-
sociated with several entries in the UMLS Meta-
thesaurus).
In many solutions, the three steps in biomedic-
al NER (namely, recognition, categorisation and 
mapping  to  databases)  are  merged  within  one 
module. For example, using an existing termino-
logical database for recognition of NEs, effect-
ively  leads  to  complete  term  identification  (in 
cases where there are no ambiguities). Some re-
searchers, however, have stressed the advantages 
of tackling each step as a separate task, pointing 
at different sources and methods needed to ac-
complish each of the subtasks (Torii et al, 2003; 
Lee et al, 2003). Also, in the case of modularisa-
tion,  it  is  easier  to  integrate  different  solutions 
for each specific problem. However, it has been 
suggested  that  whether  a  clear  separation  into 
single steps would improve term identification is 
an  open  issue  (Krauthammer  and  Nenadic, 
2004). In this paper we discuss a cascaded, mod-
ular approach to biomedical NER.

notation:  Modules in a pipeline
In this Section we present a modular approach to 
identification, disambiguation and annotation of

2005); Swiss-Prot, http://ca.expasy.org/sprot/

several  biomedical  semantic  types  in  the  text. 
Full identification of NEs and resolving ambigu-
ities in particular, may require a full parse tree of 
a  sentence  in  addition  to  the  analysis  of  local 
context  information.  On  the  other  hand,  full 
parse trees may be only derivable after NEs are 
resolved.  Methods to efficiently overcome these 
problems are not yet available today and in order 
to come up with an applicable solution,  it  was 
necessary to choose a more pragmatic approach.
We  first  discuss  the  basic  principles  and 
design of the processing pipeline, which is based 
on  a  pragmatic  cascade  of  modules,  and  then 
present each of the modules separately.
3.1 Modular  design  of  a  text  processing 
pipeline
Our methodology is based on the idea of separat-
ing the process into clearly defined functions ap-
plied one after  another  to  text,  in  a processing 
pipeline characterized  by  the  following  state-
ments:
(P1)  The complete  text  processing task con-
sists of separate and independent modules.
(P2)  The  task  is  performed  by  running  all 
modules exactly once in a fixed sequence.
(P3) Each module operates continuously on an 
input  stream and  performs  its  function  on 
stretches or  ?windows? of text  that  are usually 
much smaller than the whole input.  As soon as a 
window is  processed,  the module  produces  the 
resulting output.
(P4) After the startup phase, all modules run 
in parallel.  Incoming requests for annotation are 
accepted by a master process that ensures that all 
required modules are approached in the right or-
der.
(P5) Communication of information between 
the modules is strictly downstream and all meta-
information is contained in the data stream itself 
in the form of XML markup.
An instance of a processing pipeline (which is 
actually  embedded in  EBIMed)  is  presented in 
Figure 1. The modules M-1 to M-8 are run in this 
order,  and  no  communication  between them is 
needed apart  from streaming the  text  from the 
output  of  one  module  to  the  input  of  another. 
The text contains the meta-data as XML markup. 
The modules are described below.
Figure 1. A processing pipeline embedded in 
EBIMed
Although  this  is  the  standard  pipeline  for 
EBIMed, it is possible to re-arrange the modules 
to  favour  identification  of  specific  semantic 
types. More precisely, in our modular approach, 
after identification of a term in the text, disam-
biguation only decides whether the term is of that 
type or not. If it is not, the specific annotation is 
removed and left to the downstream modules to 
tag the term differently.  While this  requires  n 
identification steps, adding identification of new 
types is independent of modules already present. 
However, the prioritization of semantic types is 
enforced  by  the  order  of  the  associated  term 
identification modules.  
3.2 Input documents and pre-processing
Input  documents  are  XML-formatted  Medline 
abstracts as provided from the National Library 
of  Medicine  (NLM).   The  XML  structure  of 
Medline abstracts includes meta information at-
tached  to  the  original  document,  such  as  the 
journal, author list, affiliations, publication dates 
as well as annotations inserted by the NLM such 
as  creation  date  of  the  Medline  entry,  list  of 
chemicals associated with the document, as well 
as related MeSH headings. 
The  text  processing  modules  are  only  con-
cerned with the document  parts  that  consist  of 
natural  language  text.   In  Medline  abstracts, 
these stretches of text are marked up as  Article-
Title and AbstractText.  Inside these elements we 
add  another  XML element,  called  text,  to  flag 
natural language text independent of the original 
input  document format  (module  M-1 in  Figure 
1).  Thereby the subsequent text processing mod-
ules become independent of the document struc-
ture: other document types, e.g. BioMed Central 
13
full  text  papers,  can  easily  be  fed  into  the 
pipeline providing a simple adaptation of the in-
put pre-processor. 
As  a  final  pre-processing  step  (M-2),  sen-
tences  are  identified  and  marked  using  the 
<SENT> tag.
3.3 Finding protein names in text
For identification of protein names (M-3 in Fig-
ure  1),  we  use  an  existing  protein  repository. 
UniProt/Swiss-Prot  contains  roughly  190,000 
protein/gene  names  (PGNs)  in  database  entries 
that also annotate proteins with protein function, 
species  and  tissue  type.   PGNs  from 
UniProt/Swiss-Prot are matched with regular ex-
pressions which account for morphological vari-
ability.  These terms are tagged using the <z:uni-
prot> tag (see Figure 2).  The list  of  identifiers 
(ids attribute) contains the accession numbers of 
the mentioned protein in the UniProt/Swiss-Prot 
database.  All  synonyms  from a  database  entry 
are kept,  and in the case of homonymy, where 
one name refers to several  database entries,  all 
accession numbers are stored.  The pair consist-
ing of the database name and the accession num-
ber(s) forms a unique identifier (UID) that rep-
resents  the  semantics  of  the  term  and  can  be 
trivially  rewritten  into  a  URL  pointing  to  the 
database entry. Each entity also contains the at-
tribute  fb which  provides  the  frequency of  the 
term in the British National Corpus (BNC).
3.4 Resolving (some) protein name ambigu-
ities
The approach to finding names that we presented 
can create three types of ambiguities mentioned 
above in Section 2.
In the current implementation,  Amb1 (ambi-
guity  within a  given resource)  is  not  resolved. 
Rather, the links to  all entries in the same data-
base are maintained.  Amb2 and Amb3 are par-
tially  resolved  for  protein/gene  names  as  ex-
plained below (steps M-4 and M-5).  Note that 
Amb2 is  resolved  on  ?first-come  first-serve? 
basis, meaning that an annotation introduced by 
one module is not overwritten by a subsequent 
module.
Many protein names are indeed or at least look 
like abbreviations. It has been proved that ambi-
guities of abbreviations and acronyms found in 
Medline abstracts can be automatically resolved 
with high accuracy  (Yu et  al.,  2002;  Schwartz 
and Hearst, 2003; Gaudan et al, 2005). 
<SENT sid=?2? pm=?.?> Aberrant

proteins  .
In our approach (Gaudan et al, 2005) all ac-
ronyms from Medline have been gathered togeth-
er  
with their expanded forms, called senses.  In ad-
dition all morphological and syntactical variants 
of a known expanded form have been extracted 
from Medline.   Expanded forms were  categor-
ised  into  classes  of  semantically  equivalent 
forms.   Feature  representations  of  Medline  ab-
stracts containing the acronym and the expanded 
form were used to train support vector machines 
(SVMs).   Disambiguation of acronyms to their 
senses in Medline abstracts based on the SVMs 
was achieved at an accuracy of above 98%.  This 
was independent from the presence of the expan-
ded form in the Medline abstract.  This disam-
biguation solution lead to the solution integrated 
into the processing pipeline.  
A potential protein has to be evaluated against 
three possible outcomes: either a name is an ac-
ronym and can be resolved as (a) a protein or (b) 
not a protein, or (c) a name cannot be resolved. 
To  distinguish  cases  (a)  and  (b)  the  document 
content  is  processed  to  identify  the  expanded 
form of the acronym and to check whether the 
expanded form refers to a protein name.  In case 
of (c), the frequency of the name in the  British 
National  Corpus  (BNC)  is  compared  with  a 
threshold.   If  the  frequency is  higher  than  the 
threshold, the name is assumed not to be a pro-
tein name.  The threshold was chosen not to ex-
clude important protein names that have already 
entered common English (such as insulin).
The disambiguation module (M-4) runs on the 
results of the previous module that performs pro-
tein-name  matching  and  indiscriminately  as-
sumes each match to  be  a  protein name.  The 
14
module  M-4 marks  up all  known acronym ex-
pansions in the text and combines the two pieces 
of  information:  a  marked  up  protein  name  is 
looked up in the list of abbreviations.  If the ab-
breviation has an expansion that is marked up in 
the vicinity and denotes a protein name, the ab-
breviation is verified as a protein name (case (a) 
above)  by  adding  an  attribute  with  a  suitable 
value to the protein tag.  The annotation also in-
cludes  the  normalised  form  of  the  acronym, 
which serves as an identifier for further database 
lookups. Similarly, if the expansion is clearly not 
a protein name, the same attribute is used with 
the according value.
Finally, the module M-5 removes the protein 
name markup if the name is either (b) clearly not 
a  protein,  or  in case (c)  has a BNC frequency 
beyond the threshold.
3.5 Finding other names in text
Further modules (M-6, M-7 and M-8 in Fig. 1) 
perform  matching  and  markup  for  drugs  from 
MedlinePlus9,  species  from Entrez  Taxonomy10 
and terms from the Gene Ontology (GO).  As for 
proteins,  the  semantic  type  is  signified  by  the 
element name and a unique ID referencing the 
source database is added as an attribute.  Disam-
biguation for these names and terms is, however, 
not yet available.
Finding GO ontology terms in text can be dif-
ficult, as these names are typically ?descriptions? 
rather than real terms (e.g. GO:0016886,  ligase 
activity,  forming  phosporic  ester  bonds),  and 
therefore  are  not  likely  to  appear  in  text  fre-
quently  (McCray  et  al.,  2002;  Verspoor  et  al., 
2003; Nenadic et al, 2004).
Figure 3 shows an example of a sentence an-
notated for semantic types and POS information 
using the pipeline from the Figure 1.  Note that 
POS tags are inside the type tags although type 
annotation has been performed prior to the POS 
tagging.
3.6 Other modules in the pipeline
The modular text processing pipeline of EBIMed 
is currently being extended to include other mod-
ules. The part-of-speech tagger (POS-tagger) is a 
separate module and combines tokenization and 
POS annotation.  It leaves previously annotated 
entities  as  single  tokens,  even  for  multi-word 
terms,  and  assigns  a  noun  POS  tag  to  every 
named entity.

formation, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/
Shallow parsing is introduced as another layer 
in the multidimensional annotation of biomedical 
documents.  After the NER modules, the shallow 
parsing modules extract events of protein-protein 
interactions.  Shallow parsing basically annotates 
noun  phrases  (NP)  and  verb  groups.   Noun 
phrases  that  contain  a  protein  name  receive  a 
modified NP tag (Protein-NP) to simplify finding 
of  protein-protein interaction phrases.   Patterns 
of Protein-NPs in conjunction with selected verb 
groups are annotated as final result.

4 EBIMed
This cascaded approach to NER has been incor-
porated into EBIMed, a system for mining bio-
medical literature.
EBIMed is a service that combines document 
retrieval  with  co-occurrence-based  summariza-
tion  of  Medline  abstracts.  Upon  a  keyword 
query, EBIMed retrieves abstracts from EMBL-
EBI?s installation of Medline and filters for bio-
medical terminology.  The final result is organ-
ised in a view displaying pairs of concepts.  Each 
pair co-occurs in at least one sentence in the re-
trieved  abstracts.  The  findings  (e.g. 
UniProt/Swiss-Prot  proteins,  GO  annotations, 
drugs and species) are listed in conjunction with 
the  UniProt/Swiss-Prot  protein  that  appears  in 
the same biological context.  All terms, retrieved 
abstracts and extracted sentences are automatic-
ally linked to contextual information, e.g. entries 
in biomedical databases. 
The annotation modules are also available via 
HTTP  request  that  allows  for  specification  of 
which modules to run (cf. Whatizit11).  Note that 
with  suitable  pre-processing  to  insert  the 
<text> tags, even well formed HTML can be 
processed. 
5 Lessons Learnt so far
Our  text  mining  solution  EBIMed successfully 
applies multi-dimensional markup in a pipeline 
of text processing modules to facilitate online re-
trieval  and mining of  the  biomedical  literature. 
The final goal is semantic annotation of biomed-
ical  terms  with  UID,  and  ? in  the  next  step  ? 
shallow parsing based text  processing for  rela-
tionship  identification.   The  following  lessons 
have been learnt during design, implementation 
and use of our system.  
The end-users expect to see the original docu-
ment at all times and therefore we have to rely on 
proper  formatting  of  the  original  and  the  pro-
cessed text.  Consequently, when adding semant-
ic information, all  other meta-information must 
be  preserved  to  allow  for  proper  rendering  as 
similar  as  possible  to  the  original  document. 
Therefore,  our  approach  does  not  remove  any 
pre-existing annotations supplied by the publish-
er, i.e. the original document could be recovered 
by removing all introduced markup.
All modules only process sections of the docu-
ment containing the natural language text, which 
improves modularisation.  The document struc-
ture is irrelevant to single modules and facilitates 
reading  and  writing  to  the  input  and  output 
11 http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Rebholz-srv/whatizit/pipe
stream, respectively, without taking notice of the 
beginning and/or the end of a single document. 
All  information exchanged between modules is 
contained in the data stream. This facilitates run-
ning all the modules in a given pipeline in paral-
lel, after an initial start-up. Even more, the mod-
ules can be distributed on separate machines with 
no implementation overheads for the communic-
ation over the network.  Adding more modules 
with their own processors does not significantly 
impair overall runtime behaviour for large data-
sets and leads to fast text processing throughput 
combined with a reasonable ? albeit not yet per-
fect ? quality, which allows for new and prac-
tically  useful  text  mining  solutions  such  as 
EBIMed.
Modularisation  of  the  text  processing  tasks 
leads to improved scalability and maintainability 
inherent to all modular software solutions.  In the 
case of the presented solution, the modular ap-
proach allows for a selection of the setup and or-
dering of the modules, leading to a flexible soft-
ware design, which can be adapted to different 
types of documents and which allows for an (in-
cremental)  replacement  of  methods  to  improve 
the quality of the output.  This can also facilitate 
improved  interoperability  of  XML-based  NLP 
tools.
Semantic  annotation  of  named  entities  and 
terms  blends  effectively  with  logical  markup, 
simply because there is no overlap between doc-
ument  structure  and  named  entities  and  terms. 
On the other hand, some physical markup (such 
as <i> in the BMC corpus) is in some documents 
used to highlight names or terms of a semantic 
type, e.g. gene names.  With consistent semantic 
markup, this kind of physical tags could be aban-
doned to be replaced by external style informa-
tion.  However, some semantic annotations still 
must be combined with physical markup as in the 
term B-sup that initially was annotated by a pub-
lisher  as  <b>B</b>-sup and  that  now  (after 
NER)  would  be  marked  as 
<z:uniprot><b>B</b>-sup</z:uniprot>.
Matching  of  names  of  a  semantic  type,  e.g. 
protein/gene,  is  done on a ?longest  of  the left-
most? basis and prioritization of semantic types 
is enforced by the order of the term identification 
modules.   Both  choices  lead  to  the  result  that 
overlapping annotations are preempted and that 
annotations  automatically  endorse  a  link  to  a 
unique identifier, unless there are ambiguity on 
the  level  of  biomedical  resource..  This  type of 
ambiguity is not resolved in our text processing 
solution.  Instead, for a given biomedical term, 
links to all  entries referring to this  term in the 
same database are kept.  
16
One approach to the disambiguation of Amb2 
(multiple resources)  and  Amb3 (common Eng-
lish words) ambiguities would be to integrate all 
terms into  one massive dictionary,  identify  the 
strings in the text and then disambiguate between 
n semantic types.  This would require the disam-
biguation module be trained to distinguish all se-
mantic types. If a new type is added, the disam-
biguation  module  would  need  to  be  retrained, 
which limits the possibilities for expansion and 
tailoring of text mining solutions.
Open Problems: We consider two categories of 
open  problems:  NLP-based  and  XML-based 
problems.
Bio  NLP-based  problems include  challenges 
in recognition and disambiguation of biomedical 
names in text. One of the main issues in our ap-
proach  is  annotation  of  compound  and  nested 
terms.  The  presented  methodology can  lead  to 
the following annotations:
1. the head noun belongs to the same semantic 
type, but is not part of the protein name (as 
represented in the terminological resource): 
<z:uniprot>Wnt-2</z:uniprot> protein
2. the head noun belongs to a different semantic 
type not covered by any of the available ter-
minological resources:
<z:uniprot>WNT8B</z:uniprot> mRNA
3. a compound term consists of terms from dif-
ferent semantic types, but its semantic type is 
not known:
<z:uniprot  fb=?0?  ids=???>beta-
catenin</z:uniprot>  <z:go  ids=??? 
onto= ???>binding </z:go> domain
Therefore,  an important  open problem is the 
annotation of nested terms where an entity name 
is part of a larger term that may or may not be in 
one of the  dictionaries.  Once the  inner term is 
marked up with inline annotation, simple string 
pattern matching (utilised in our approach) can-
not be used easily to find the outer, because the 
XML structure is in the way.  A more effective 
solution could be  a combination of inline  with 
stand-off annotation.
Further, in a more complex case such as in
htr-wnt-<uniprot>A protein</uniprot>
neither wnt nor htr refer to a single protein but 
to a protein family, and whereas A protein is 
a known protein, this is not the case for wnt-A. 
The most obvious annotation <uniprot>htr-
wnt-A protein</uniprot> cannot be re-
solved  by  the  terminology  from  the 
UniProt/Swiss-Prot  database,  as  it  simply  does 
not exist in the database.
More work is also needed on disambiguation 
of  terms  that  correspond  to  common  English 
words.  
Annotation (i.e. XML)-based problems mainly 
relate to an open question whether different tag 
names should be used for various semantic types, 
or semantic types should be represented via at-
tributes  of  a  generalised  named entity  or  term 
tag.  In EBIMed, specific tags are used to denote 
specific semantic types.  A similar challenge is 
how to treat and make use of entities such as in-
line references, citations and formulas (typically 
annotated in journals), which are commonly ig-
nored by NLP modules.
The most important issue, however, is how to 
represent still unresolved ambiguities, so that an-
notations might be modified at a later stage, e.g. 
when POS information or even the full parse tree 
is available. This also includes the issues on kind 
of information that should be made available for 
later  processing.  For  example,  as  (compound) 
term identification is done before POS tagging, 
an  open  question  is  whether  POS  information 
should be assigned to individual components of a 
compound term (in addition to the term itself), 
since this information could be used to complete 
NER or adjust the results in a later stage.  
6 Conclusions 
In  this  paper,  we  have described  a  pipeline  of 
XML-based modules for  identification and dis-
ambiguation  of  several  semantic  types  of  bio-
medical  named entities.  The pipeline  processes 
and semantically enriches documents by adding, 
changing  or  removing  annotations.   More  pre-
cisely, the documents are augmented with UIDs 
referring to referential databases.  In the course 
of the processing, the number of annotated NEs 
increases and the quality of  the annotation im-
proves.  Thus, one of the main issues is to repres-
ent still  unresolved ambiguities consistently, so 
that  the  following  modules  can  perform  both 
identification  and  disambiguation  of  new  se-
mantic types. As subsequent modules try to add 
new  semantic  annotations,  prioritization  of  se-
mantic types is enforced by the order of the term 
identification modules.  
We have shown that such approach can be em-
ployed in a real-world, online information min-
ing  system EBIMed.   The  end-users  expect  to 
view the original layout of the documents at all 
times, and thus the solution needs to provide an 
efficient multidimensional markup that preserves 
and combines existing markup (from publishers) 
with semantic NLP-derived tags.  Since, in the 
biomedical  domain,  it  is  essential  to  provide 
17
links from term and named-entity occurrences to 
referential databases, EBIMed provides identific-
ation and disambiguation of such entities and in-
tegrates text with other knowledge sources.
The existing solution to annotate only longest 
non-overlapped entities is useful for real world 
use scenarios, but we also need ways to improve 
annotations  by  representing  nested  and  over-
lapped terms.
