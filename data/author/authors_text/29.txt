Abstract
This paper describes a study on performance
of existing unsupervised algorithms of text
documents topical segmentation when ap-
plied to Polish plain text documents. For
performance measurement five existing top-
ical segmentation algorithms were selected,
three different Polish test collections were
created and seven approaches to text pre-
processing were implemented. Based on
quantitative results (Pk and WindowDiff
metrics) use of specific algorithm was rec-
ommended and impact of pre-processing
strategies was assessed. Thanks to use of
standardized metrics and application of pre-
viously described methodology for test col-
lection development, comparative results for
Polish and English were also obtained.
1 Introduction
Rapid development of Internet-based information
services is marked by a proliferation of information
available on-line. Even if the Web shifts towards
multimedia content and structured documents, con-
tents of the Web sources remains predominantly tex-
tual and poorly structured; an important fraction of
this flood of plain text documents consists in multi-
topical documents. This abundance of complex but
plain text or just visually structured documents (as
is in case of most HTML files) creates a strong need
for intelligent text processing including robust and
efficient information extraction and retrieval.
One way of increasing efficiency of typical text
processing tasks consists in processing separately
text segments instead of whole documents. While
different text segmentation strategies can be ap-
plied including splitting text into segments of equal
length, using moving windows of constant size or
discourse units (Reynar, 1998), division into topical
segment is intuitively more justified. This approach
is applicable in several IR and NLP areas including
document indexing, automatic summarization and
question answering (Choi, 2002).
For Information Extraction domain, two main ap-
plication of topical document segmentation are re-
lated to documents pre-processing and supporting
some basic tasks widely used by IE tools. Topi-
cal segmentation applied to individual documents as
well as documents streams (e.g. dialogues of radio
broadcast transcripts) is an initial step for further IE
processing (Manning, 1998); when combined with
segments labelling, classification or clustering (Al-
lan et al, 1998) it allows to pre-select ranges of text
to be mined for mentions of events, entities and re-
lations relevant to users needs and available IE re-
sources. This limits significantly size of text to be
processed by IE methods (Hearst and Plaunt, 1993)
and thus influences significantly overall IE perfor-
mance.
On the other hand, many basic tasks required by
IE domain (both related to IE resources creation
and document (pre-)processing) make use of sec-
tions rather than whole documents. In these tasks
including language modelling (esp. gathering of
co-occurrences statistics for trigger-based language
models), anaphora resolution, word sense disam-
biguation and coreference detection, definition of
proper context is crucial. To this extend entities
51
discovered by topical segmentation are more reli-
able than document, paragraph or sentence contexts
as they help avoid usage of unrelated parts of doc-
uments as well as minimize sparse data problems
(Choi, 2002).
1.1 Problem Statement
In this study we adopted definition proposed in (Fle-
jter, 2006) stating that ?linear topical segmentation
of text consists in extracting coherent blocks of text
such that: 1) any block focuses on exactly one topic
2) any pair of consecutive blocks have different main
topics.? We also accepted that two segments should
be defined as having different or same topics when-
ever they are judged so by people.
Depending on the used document collection and
user needs, text segmentation objective is to find top-
ical segments in individual multi-topical text docu-
ments or to discover boundaries between consecu-
tive stories or news items (e.g. in radio broadcast
transcriptions or text news streams).
Approaches to the problem of text segmentation
can be divided according to a number of dimensions
(Flejter, 2006) including cognitive approach (in op-
timistic approach text structure intended by author is
cognitively accessible, in pessimistic approach it is
not), hierarchical or linear segmentation (do we seg-
ment text into some levels of embedded segments?),
completeness of segmentation (does the segmenta-
tion need to cover the whole text?), disjointness of
segments (can two segments have any common text
ranges?), fuzziness of segments boundaries (how
fuzzy is the actual boundary location?), global or lo-
cal view of topics (is there any global, document-
independent list of topics?).
In this study we investigate linear, complete, dis-
joint segments with binary boundaries and local
view of topics. Selected algorithms focus on text
segmentation without considering labelling or clus-
tering of discovered segments.
1.2 Our Contributions
The contributions of our research described in this
paper are twofold. Firstly, we developed three Pol-
ish test collections for text segmentation task (see:
Section 3.1). Secondly, we performed an extensive
study of performance of most popular segmentation
algorithms (see: Section 3.2) and pre-processing
strategies (see: Section 3.3) when applied to Pol-
ish documents; a total of 42 scenarios including dif-
ferent algorithms, pre-processing strategies and test
collections were evaluated (see: Section 4).
2 Approaches to Topical Segmentation
As in case of most NLP tasks, a number of differ-
ent linguistic theories influenced topic segmentation
resulting in a variety of approaches applied. This
section gives a short presentation of major theories
underlying topical segmentation and an overview of
most popular segmentation algorithms with empha-
sis on those evaluated in our experiment.
2.1 Theoretical Foundations
Out of linguistic approaches cohesion theory of Hal-
liday and Hassan had the strongest impact on top-
ical text segmentation. It analyzes several mecha-
nisms of documents internal cohesion including ref-
erences, substitution, ellipsis, conjunction (logical
relations) and lexical cohesion (reuse of the same
words to address the same object or objects of the
same class as well as use of terms which are more
general or semantically related in systematic or non-
systematic way). Other relevant linguistic theories
include Grosz and Sinder?s discourse segmentation
theory, Rhetorical Structure Theory and taxonomy
of text structures proposed Skorochod?ko (Reynar,
1998).
Out of empirical statistical rules some authors
make use of heuristics resulting form Heaps? law for
new-words-based topical segment boundary detec-
tion. However, the most important theoretical foun-
dations in quantitative methods are related to strong
probabilistic frameworks including Hidden Markov
Models (Mulbregt et al, 1998) and Maximal En-
tropy Theory (Beeferman et al, 1997).
2.2 Basic Methods
The most simple but also the most frequently used
methods of topical text segmentation do not re-
quire training (thus they are domain-independent)
nor make use of any complex linguistic resources or
utilities. Apart from methods based on new vocab-
ulary analysis, this category of algorithms applies
widely the simplest form of lexical cohesion i.e. re-
iterations of the same word.
52
The first classical text segmentation algorithm
of this type is TextTiling described in (Hearst and
Plaunt, 1993). Its analysis unit consists of pseudo-
sentences corresponding to series of consecutive
words (typically 20 words). After the whole text
is divided into pseudo-sentences, a window of 12
pseudo-sentences is slid over the text (with one
pseudo-sentence step). At any position the window
is decomposed into two six-pseudo-sentences blocks
and their similarity is calculated by means of cosine
measure. Measurements for all consecutive window
positions (understood as positions of centre of the
window) form lexical cohesion curve local minima
of which correspond to segments boundaries. The
original algorithm was further enhanced in several
ways including use of words similarity measurement
based on co-occurrences (Kaufmann, 1999).
Another group of basic algorithms makes use of
technique of DotPlotting, originally proposed by
Raynar in (Reynar, 1994). In this approach 2D chart
is used for lexical cohesion analysis with both axes
corresponding to positions (in words) in the text; on
the chart points are drawn at coordinates (x, y) and
(y, x) iff words at positions x and y are equal. In this
settings coherent text segments correspond visually
to squares with high density of points. DotPlotting
image is than segmented using one of two strate-
gies: minimization of points density at the bound-
aries (minimization of external incoherence) or max-
imization of density of segments (maximization of
internal coherence) (Reynar, 1998). The original
DotPlotting algorithm requires to explicitly provide
expected number of segments as input.
Improved version of DotPlotting algorithm called
C99 (Choi, 2000) uses DotPlotting chart for vi-
sualization of similarity measurements at consecu-
tive point of the text (thus resulting in point with
different levels of intensity) instead of words co-
occurences. Afterwards, mask-based ranking tech-
nique is used for image enhancement. For ac-
tual segmentation, dynamic programming technique
similar to DotPlotting maximization algorithm is
used; an optional automatic termination strategy is
also implemented thus allowing the algorithm to as-
sess number of boundaries. In further work of the
same and other authors several enhancements of C99
algorithm were proposed.
2.3 Methods Requiring External Resources
Still not requiring training and domain independent,
some methods make use of linguistic resources more
sophisticated than stop-list. Two classes of such so-
lution described in existing work are solutions us-
ing lexical chains (Morris and Hirst, 1991; Min-
Yen Kan, 1998) (which require to use some the-
saurus) and based on spreading activation (Kozima,
1993) (which depend on weights-based semantic
network constructed from thesaurus). In both cases
the effort put in algorithm enactment is quite high;
however in principle no additional resources need to
be developed for new texts (even from different do-
mains).
2.4 Methods Requiring Training
Last group of methods includes supervised meth-
ods with generally strong mathematical foundations.
They perform very well; however they require train-
ing that possibly needs to be repeated when new
domain needs to be addressed. The methods in
this group use probabilistic frameworks including
maximal entropy (Beeferman et al, 1997), Hidden
Markov Models (Mulbregt et al, 1998) and Proba-
bilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (Blei and Moreno,
2001).
3 Experimental Setup
Segmentation algorithms performance was evalu-
ated for 42 scenarios corresponding to different al-
gorithms, pre-processing strategies and test collec-
tions. For quantitative analysis and comparability
with previous and future research results two stan-
dard segmentation metrics were applied in all sce-
narios.
3.1 Test Collections
For performance measurement three test collections
corresponding to different types of segmentation
tasks were developed: artificial documents collec-
tion (AC), stream collection (SC) and individual
documents collection (DC). AC and SC were con-
structed based on 936 issues of EuroPAP (Euro-
pean information service of Polish Press Agency)
plain-text e-mail newsletter (EuroPAP, 2005) col-
lected from November 2001 to May 2005. Typ-
ical issue of EuroPAP newsletter contained about
53
25 complete news articles and a number of short
(containing at most several sentences) news items.
DC was constructed based on articles retrieved form
Wikipedia corresponding to ten most populous Pol-
ish cities (Wikipedia, 2007) covering typically sev-
eral topics (e.g. geography, culture, transportation).
For AC creation we followed precisely the
method applied for English in (Choi, 2000). Each
artificial document was created as a concatenation of
random number (n) of first sentences from ten news
articles randomly selected from a total of 24927
news items in EuroPAP corpus. Four subcollections
were created depending on allowed range of n as
listed in Table 1. Any two selected articles were as-
sumed to cover two different topics; thus reference
segmentation boundaries corresponded to points of
concatenations.

n 3-11 3-5 6-8 9-11
documents count 400 100 100 100
Table 1: Artificial collection subcollections
For SC creation newsletter messages from Eu-
roPAP were used as text streams (936 messages).
The reference segmentation was created using origi-
nal article boundaries present in EuroPAP mail mes-
sages (almost 30000 segments were marked).
For individual documents collection development
text content was extracted from Wikipedia docu-
ments, all headings were removed and all list items
(LI tags) with no terminal punctuation sign were
added a dot. Manual tagging by two authors of
this paper was performed. The instructions were
to put segment boundaries in the places of poten-
tial section titles. Obtained percent agreement of
0.988 and ? coefficient (Carletta, 1996) of 0.975
suggest high convergence of both annotations. Fur-
ther, in places where the two annotators opinions dif-
fered (one marked boundary and the other did not),
negotiation-based approach (Flejter, 2006) was ap-
plied in order to develop reference segmentation.
3.2 Selected algorithms
In our experiment we used Choi?s publicly available
implementation of several text segmentation algo-
rithms not requiring training (with several adapta-

DC 28.5 9.9 300.0 110.2
Table 2: The average length of reference segments
tion concerning pre-processing stages). Specifically
we used Choi?s implementation of TextTiling algo-
rithm (TT ), C99 algorithm for both known (C99l)
and unknown (C99) number of boundaries as well
as DotPlotting maximization (DP ) and minimiza-
tion (DPmin) algorithms.
Algorithms not requiring to provide number of
segments as input (TT , C99) were evaluated on all
test collections; performance of the remaining algo-
rithms (C99l, DP , DPmin) was measured only for
AC.
3.3 Pre-processing variants
We decided to prepare seven variants of the test col-
lections (see Table 3). The motivation for the first
group (variants: P1, P2, P3, P4) was to be as close
to Choi?s methodology as possible. That?s why we
used simple pre-processing techniques like lemma-
tization and stop-lists. The remaining variants (P5,
P6, P7) were chosen arbitrarily to check how addi-
tional morphological information will influence the
performance of the main segmentation algorithms in
case of Polish language.
The pre-processing stage included two steps. Ini-
tially, documents were split into sentences and word
tokens (punctuation signs were removed) by means
of tokenizer and sentence boundary recognizer of
SProUT ? a shallow text processing system tai-
lored to processing Polish language (Piskorski et
al., 2004). Afterwards the generated token stream
was normalized; for this task SProUT?s interface for
a dictionary based Polish morphological analyzer
? Morfeusz (Wolin?ski, 2007) was used. This al-
lowed us to use variety of morphological informa-
tion (including STEM, POS, NUMBER, TENSE).
The drawback of such an approach was that to-
kens not present in Morfeusz?s dictionary were not
stemmed (accounting for 12.8% of all tokens or
31.7% of unique tokens; note that Morfeusz input

Table 3: pre-processing variants
contained all the tokens including numbers, hyper-
links, dates, etc.). Another problematic issue was
ambiguity of morphological analysis (1.4 interpre-
tation on average); we addressed this issue by us-
ing the following order of preference: 1) verbs, 2)
nouns, 3) adjectives, 4) other word classes.
The stop-lists (inflected and lemmatized versions
contained 616 and 350 tokens respectively) were
prepared manually by analysing frequency lists of
previously used text corpus.
3.4 Evaluation metrics
A number of different measurement methods were
applied to topical texts segmentation including
recall-precision pair (Hearst and Plaunt, 1993; Pas-
sonneau and Litman, 1997), edit distance (Ponte
and Croft, 1997), P? (Beeferman et al, 1997), Pk
(Beeferman et al, 1999) and WindowDiff (Pevzner
and Hearst, 2002).
Pk is simplified version of probabilistic measure
P? based on assumption that any two consecutive
boundaries are at distance of k sentences (k being
parameter normally set to half of length of aver-
age segment in reference segmentation). After some
simplifications Pk is defined by the following for-
mula (Flejter, 2006):
Pk(r, h) = 1 ?
1
n? k
n?k?
i=1
(|?r(i, k) ? ?h(i, k)|)
where ?X(i, k) equals to one if ith and (i + k)th
sentences are in the same segment of segmentation
X , otherwise it is equal to zero; X = r corresponds
to reference segmentation and X = h corresponds
to hypothetical (algorithm-generated) segmentation.
In most publication instead of performance mea-
surement using Pk, probabilistic error metric (P =
1 ? Pk(r, h)) is applied. For easier comparison
with previous results we calculated this measure for
tested evaluation scenarios.
Based on a profound analysis of Pk and proba-
bilistic metric drawbacks more recently WindowD-
iff error measure was proposed based on counting
number of boundaries within window of size of k
sentences sliding parallelly over both hypothetical
and reference segmentations. WindowDiff can be
calculated by the following formula:
Wk(r, h) =
1
N ? k
N?k?
i=1
(|br(i, k) ? bh(i, k)| > 0)
with bX(i, k) corresponding to the number of
boundaries between positions i and i+k in segmen-
tation X .
Both probabilistic error and WindowDiff measure
the segmentation error; therefore, the lower is their
value, the better is segmentation result.
4 Experimental Results
Calculated values of P and WindowDiff (WD)
measures were used to compare performance of
different algorithms, collections and pre-processing
strategies. If not stated otherwise, results displayed
in this Section correspond to P1 variant (no pre-
processing) of test collections.

performs much better than TextTiling on all test col-
lections with extremely high WindowDiff value for
TextTiling (especially for longer texts). Both al-
gorithms perform better on artificial than on actual
documents; for C99 drop in performance between

Table 5: Comparison of methods requiring number
of segments as input
Probabilistic error and WindowDiff results for al-
gorithms requiring expected number of segments
as input (C99l, DP , DPmin) are listed in Ta-
ble 5. C99l performs slightly better than DotPlotting
with maximization strategy (DP ) and the perfor-
mance of DotPlotting applying minimization strat-
egy (DPmin) is visibly lower. Results do not differ
significantly between AC subcollections suggesting
that length of document has minor impact on perfor-
mance.
As C99 was developed both in version requiring
and not requiring to specify the expected number of
segments, impact of this information on algorithm
performance was analyzed. As expected C99l out-
performs C99; in our experiments additional infor-
mation on segments count lowered the error rates by
4?16% (see: Table 6).

comparison are gathered in Table 7; for English re-
sults were taken from Choi?s paper and for Polish
P3 variant of our artificial collection corresponding
to Choi?s pre-processing approach was used. Com-
parative analysis shows that all algorithms (except
for TT which is highly inefficient for both Polish
and English) perform significantly worse for Polish.
Our hypothesis is that it can be attributed both to
lower performance of pre-processing tools for Pol-
ish and usage of domain specific corpus as opposed
to balanced Brown corpus used by Choi.

Table 8: Impact of different pre-processing variants
Final part of our analysis of quantitative results
focused on impact of different pre-processing strate-
gies. For each of three test collections we analyzed
the impact of pre-processing strategies in case of
56
best performing algorithm.
As the results from Table 8 show, for artificial and
stream collections the most promising strategy is to
use P3 (LSL) variant of pre-processing which de-
creased the error metric by up to 13% as compared
with P1 (no pre-processing) variant. Interestingly,
the same approach applied to individual documents
collection actually increased values of error met-
rics; in this case significant decrease of error rates
was possible by use of the most complex P6 and P7
strategies. Reasons for this difference may include:
a) disproportion in number of unrecognized tokens
(22.8% for DC vs. 12.75% for AC/SC), b) different
structure of DC reference segments (higher number
of shorter sentences, see: Table 2), c) standard de-
viation of segment length in DC much higher than
in AC/DC (35% of average length in case of DC vs.
25% in case of both AC and SC). We leave analysis
of this factors? impact for future work.
Our analysis also shows that adding NUMBER
tag for nouns and adjectives (P7) has no impact on
algorithms performance as compared with P6.
5 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper we analyzed performance of several
topical text segmentation algorithms for Polish with
several pre-processing strategies on three different
test collections. Our research demonstrate that sim-
ilarly to English C99 (and its variant with expected
segments count input C99l) is the best performing
segmentation algorithm and we recommend that it
be applied to text segmentation for Polish. Based on
our research we also suggest that lemmatization and
stop-list words removal (P3 variant) be used for fur-
ther improvement of performance. However, our re-
search revealed that the performance of almost all al-
gorithms (including C99) is significantly worse for
Polish than for English and remains unsatisfactory.
Therefore our further research direction will be to
focus on improvements at the pre-processing stages
of text segmentation (including enhancements in
text division into sentences, lemmatization of proper
names, and filtering of unrecognized tokens with
low document-based frequency) as well as on anal-
ysis of performance of more recent algorithms both
requiring and not requiring linguistic resources. We
would like also to evaluate text segmentation impact
on performance of coreference resolution algorithm
we are currently developing.
