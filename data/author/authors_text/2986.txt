Abstract
This paper describes the usage of XML for
representing cross-language phrase align-
ments in parallel treebanks. We have de-
veloped a TreeAligner as a tool for interac-
tively inserting and correcting such align-
ments as an independent level of treebank
annotation.
1 Introduction
The combined research on treebanks and paral-
lel corpora has recently led to parallel treebanks.
A parallel treebank consists of syntactically anno-
tated sentences in two or more languages, taken
from translated (i.e. parallel) documents. In ad-
dition, the syntax trees of two corresponding sen-
tences are aligned on a sub-sentential level. This
means word level, phrase level and clause level,
but we will refer to it as phrase alignment since
it best represents the idea. Parallel treebanks can
be used as training or evaluation corpora for word
and phrase alignment, as input for example-based
machine translation (EBMT), as training corpora
for transfer rules, or for translation studies.
We are developing an English-German-Swedish
parallel treebank. In this paper we will focus on
the representation of the treebank and the align-
ment. We will briefly explain the steps for building
the parallel treebank and describe our new align-
ment tool. This paper is a follow-up and revision
of (Samuelsson and Volk, 2005) based on fresh in-
sights from this tool.
2 Building the treebanks
Our parallel treebank contains the first two chap-
ters of Jostein Gaarder?s novel ?Sofie?s World?
with about 500 sentences.1 In addition it contains
500 sentences from economy texts (a quarterly re-
port by a multinational company as well as part of
a bank?s annual report).
In creating the parallel treebank, we have
first annotated the monolingual treebanks with
the ANNOTATE treebank editor.2 It includes
Thorsten Brants? statistical Part-of-Speech Tagger
and Chunker. The chunker follows the TIGER
annotation guidelines for German (Brants and
Hansen, 2002), which gives a flat phrase structure
tree. This means, for instance, no unary nodes,
no ?unnecessary? NPs (noun phrases) within PPs
(prepositional phrases) and no finite VPs (verb
phrases).
Using a flat tree structure for manual treebank
annotation has two advantages for the human an-
notator: fewer annotation decisions, and a better
overview of the trees. This comes at the prize
of the trees not being complete from a linguistic
point of view. Moreover, flat syntax trees are also
problematic for node alignment in a parallel tree-
bank. We prefer to have ?deep trees? to be able to
draw the alignment on as many levels as possible;
in fact, the more detailed the sentence structure is,
the more expressive our alignment can become.
As an example, let us look at the work
flow for the German-Swedish parallel treebank.
We first annotated the German sentences semi-
automatically in the flat manner, and we then auto-
matically deepened the flat syntax trees (Samuels-
son and Volk, 2004).
1A prototype of the parallel treebank was developed by
Yvonne Samuelsson and contains the first chapter of the
novel in German and Swedish. Later, a French version was
added and aligned to the Swedish treebank by (Tidstro?m,
2005). We would like to thank Eckhard Bick, Declan Groves
and Jo?rg Tiedemann for their help.

We annotated the Swedish sentences by first
tagging them with a Part-of-Speech tagger trained
on SUC (the Stockholm-Umea? Corpus). Since we
did not have a Swedish treebank to train a Swedish
chunker, we used a trick to apply the German
chunker for Swedish sentences. We mapped the
Swedish Part-of-Speech tags in the Swedish sen-
tences to the corresponding German tags. Since
the German chunker works on these tags, it then
suggested constituents for the Swedish sentences,
assuming they were German sentences. These
experiments and the resulting time gain were re-
ported in (Volk and Samuelsson, 2004). Upon
completion of the Swedish treebank with flat syn-
tax trees, we applied the same deepening method
as for German, and we then converted the Part-of-
Speech labels back to the Swedish labels.
Finally, we annotated the English sentences ac-
cording to the Penn Treebank guidelines. We
trained the PoS tagger and the chunker on the Penn
Treebank and integrated them into ANNOTATE.
The English guidelines lead to complete trees so
that the deepening step is not needed.
3 XML Representation of the Trees
After finishing the monolingual treebanks with
ANNOTATE, the trees were exported from the
accompanying SQL database and converted into
TIGER-XML. TIGER-XML is a line-based (i.e.
not nested and thus database-friendly) representa-
tion for graph structures, which includes syntax
trees with node labels, edge labels, multiple fea-
tures on the word level and even crossing edges.3
In a TIGER-XML graph each leaf (= token) and
each node (= linguistic constituent) has a unique
identifier which is prefixed with the sentence num-
ber. Leaves are numbered from 1 to 499 and nodes
starting from 500 (under the plausible assumption
that no sentence will ever have more than 499 to-
kens). As can be seen in the following exam-
ple, node 500 in sentence 12 is of the category
PP (prepositional phrase). The phrase consists
of word number 4, which is the preposition in,
plus node 502 which in turn is marked as an NP
(noun phrase), consisting of the words 5 and 6. It
should be noted that the id attribute in the token
lines serves a dual purpose of identifier and order
marker. This makes it possible to represent cross-
ing branches.

This means that the token identifiers and con-
stituent identifiers are used as pointers to represent
the nested tree structure. This example thus repre-
sents the upper tree in figure 1.
One might wonder why tree nesting is not di-
rectly mapped into XML nesting. But the require-
ment that the representation format must support
crossing edges rules out this option. TIGER-XML
is a powerful representation format and is typically
used with constituent symbols on the nodes and
functional information on the edge labels. This
constitutes a combination of constituent structure
and dependency structure information.
4 XML Representation of the Alignment
Phrase alignment can be regarded as an additional
layer of information on top of the syntax struc-
ture. We use the unique node identifiers for the
phrase alignment across parallel trees. We also
use an XML representation for storing the align-
ment. The alignment file first stores the names of
the treebank files and assigns identifiers to them.
Every single phrase alignment is then stored with
the tag align. Thus the entry in the following
example represents the alignment of node 505 in
sentence 13 of language one (German) to the node
506 in sentence 14 of language two (Swedish).
<treebanks>
<tbank file="Sofie_DE.xml" id="De"/>
<tbank file="Sofie_SV.xml" id="Sv"/>
</treebanks>
<align type="exact">
<node node_id="s13_505" tbank_id="De"/>
<node node_id="s14_506" tbank_id="Sv"/>
</align>
94
This representation allows phrase alignments
within m:n sentence alignments, which we have
used in our project. The XML also allows m:n
phrase alignments, which we however have not
used for reasons of simplicity and clarity. Two
nodes are aligned if the words which they span
convey the same meaning and could serve as trans-
lation units.
The alignment format allows alignments to be
specified between an arbitrary number of nodes,
for example nodes from three languages. And
it includes an attribute type which we currently
use to distinguish between exact and approximate
alignments.
5 Our Tree Alignment Tool
After finishing the monolingual trees we want to
align them on the phrase level. For this purpose
we have developed a ?TreeAligner?. This program
is a graphical user interface to insert (or correct)
alignments between pairs of syntax trees.4 The
TreeAligner can be seen in the line of tools such
as I*Link (Ahrenberg et al, 2002) or Cairo (Smith
and Jahr, 2000) but it is especially tailored to visu-
alize and align full syntax trees.
The TreeAligner requires three input files. One
TIGER-XML file with the trees from language
one, another TIGER-XML file with the trees from
language two, plus the alignment file as described
above. The alignment file might initially be empty
when we want to start manual alignment from
scratch, or it might contain automatically com-
puted alignments for correction. The TreeAligner
displays tree pairs with the trees in mirror orien-
tation (one top-up and one top-down). See fig-
ure 1 for an example. This has the advantage that
the alignment lines cross fewer parts of the lower
tree. The trees are displayed with node labels and
greyed-out edge labels. The PoS labels are omit-
ted in the display since they are not relevant for the
task.
Each alignment is displayed as a dotted line be-
tween one node (or word) from each tree. Clicking
on a node (or a word) in one tree and dragging the
mouse pointer to a node (or a word) in the other
tree inserts an alignment line. Figure 2 shows an
example of a tree pair with alignment lines. Cur-
rently the TreeAligner supports two types of align-

Joakim Lundborg and is freely available at www.ling.su.se/

ment lines (displayed in different colors) which
are used to indicate exact translation correspon-
dence vs. approximate translation correspondence.
However, our experiments indicate that eventually
more alignment types will be needed to precisely
represent different translation deviations.
Often one tree needs to be aligned to two trees
in the other language. We therefore provide the
option to scroll the trees independently. For in-
stance, if we have aligned only a part of tree 20
from language one to tree 18 of language two, we
may scroll to tree 19 of language two in order to
align the remaining parts of tree 20.5
The TreeAligner is designed as a stand-alone
tool (i.e. it is not prepared for collaborative anno-
tation). It stores every alignment in an XML file
(in the format described above) as soon as the user
moves to a new tree pair. It has been tested on
parallel treebanks with several hundred trees each.
6 Conclusion
We have shown a straightforward way to tie in
XML-based phrase alignment information with
syntax trees represented in TIGER-XML. The
alignment information is stored independently
from the treebank files. This independence allows
for a modularization and separation of the anno-
tation but it entails that the synchronization of the

ized with an SVG-based display which we have described in
(Samuelsson and Volk, 2005). SVG (Scalable Vector Graph-
ics) describes vector graphics in XML.

treebanks with the alignment needs to be guarded
separately. If any of the treebanks is modified, the
modification of the alignment needs to follow.
We have argued for the use of a graphical
TreeAligner to display and interactively modify
the alignment between parallel syntax trees. The
TreeAligner allows for m:n sentence alignment,
word alignment and node alignment. And it sup-
ports the distinction between exact and approxi-
mate alignments.
As a next step we plan to integrate a com-
ponent for automatic phrase alignment into the
TreeAligner. The user can then select a tree pair
and will get automatic phrase alignment predic-
tions. We have already experimented with the
projection of automatically computed word align-
ments to predict phrase alignment. Of course, the
automatic phrase alignment has to be manually
checked if we want to ensure high quality align-
ment data.
Another avenue of further research is the inclu-
sion of yet more levels of annotation. For exam-
ple, we are currently experimenting with the anno-
tation of semantic frames on top of the treebanks.
We use the SALSA tool developed at Saarbru?cken
University (Erk and Pado, 2004) which also as-
sumes TIGER-XML input. So, TIGER-XML has
become the lingua franca of treebank annotation
which allows for the addition of arbitrary layers.
