Abstract 
This article investigates (a) whether register 
discrimination can successfully exploit linguistic 
information reflecting the evolution of a 
language (such as the diglossia phenomenon of
the Modern Greek language) and (b) what kind 
of linguistic information and which statistical 
techniques may be employed to distinguish 
among individual styles within one register. 
Using clustering techniques and features 
reflecting the diglossia phenomenon, we have 
successfully discriminated registers in Modem 
Greek. However, diglossia information has not 
been shown sufficient to distinguish among 
individual styles within one register. Instead, a 
large number of linguistic features need to be 
studied with methods such as discriminant 
analysis in order to obtain a high degree of 
discrimination accuracy. 
1 Introduction 
The identification of the language style 
characterising the constituent parts of a corpus is 
very important o several appfieations. For 
example, in information retrieval applications, 
where large corpora of texts need to be searched 
efficiently, it is useful to have information about 
the language style used in each text, to improve 
the accuracy of the search (Karlgren, 1999). In 
fact, the criteria regarding language style may 
differ for each search and therefore - due to the 
large number of texts - there is a requirement to
perform style categorisation i an automated 
manner. Such systems normally use statistical 
methods to evaluate the properties of given texts. 
The complexity of the studied properties varies. 
Kilgarriff (1996) employs mainly the frequency- 
of-occurrence of words while Karlgren (1999) 
applies tatistical methods primarily on structural 
and part-of-speech information. 
Baayen et al (1996), who study the topic of 
author identification, apply statistical measures 
and methods on syntactic rewrite rules resulting 
by processing a given set of texts. They report 
that the accuracy thus obtained is higher than 
when applying the same statistical measures to 
the original text. On the other hand, Biber 
(1995) uses Multidimensional Analysis coupled 
with a large number of linguistic features to 
distinguish amongregisters. The underlying idea 
is that, rather than being distinguished on the 
basis of a set of finguistic features, registers are 
distinguished on the basis of combinations of 
weighted linguistic features, the so-called 
"dimensions". 
This article reports on the discrimination oftexts 
in written Modem Greek. The ongoing research 
described here has followed two distinct 
directions. First, we have tried to distinguish 
among registers of written Modern Greek. In a 
second phase, our research has focused on 
distinguishing among individual styles within 
one register and, more specifically, among 
speakers of the Greek Parliament. To achieve 
that, structural, morphological nd part-of-speech 
information is employed. Initially (in section 2) 
emphasis is placed on distinguishing among the 
different registers used. In section 3, the task of 
author identification is tested with selected 
statistical methods. In both sections, we describe 
the set of linguistic features measured, we argue 
for the statistical method employed and we 
comment on the results. Section 4 contains a 
description of future plans for extending this fine 
of research while in section 5 the conclusions of 
this article are provided. 
2 Distinguishing Registers 
To distinguish among registers, we successfully 
exploited a particular feature of Modem Greek, 
namely the contrast between Katharevousa and 
Demotiki. These are variation.,; of Modern Greek 
which correspond (if only roughly) to formal and 
informal speaking. Katharevoma was the official 
language of the Greek State until 1979 when it 
was replaced by Demotiki. By that time, 
Demotiki was the establis\]hed language of 
literature while, in times, it had been the 
language of elementary education. Compared to 
Demotiki, Katharevousa bears an important 
resemblance to Ancient Greek manifested 
explicitly on the morphological level and the use 
of the lexicon. At a second step, we dropped the 
Katharevousa-Demotiki approach and relied on 
part-of-speech information, which is often 
exploited in text categofisafion experiments (for 
instance, see Biber et al 1998). Again, we 
obtained satisfactory esults. 
2.1 Method of work 
The variables used to distinguish among registers 
may be grouped into the following categories: 
1. Morphological variables: These were verbal 
endings quantifying the contrast 
Katharevousa / Demofiki. Although the 
morphological differences between these two 
variations of Greek are not limited to the 
verb paradigm, we focused on the latter since 
it better highlights the contrast under 
consideration (Tainbouratzis et al, 2000). A 
total of 230 verbal endings were selected, 
split into 145 Demotiki and 85 Katharevousa 
endings (see also the Appendix). These 230 
frequencies-of-occurrence were grouped into 
12 variables for use in the, statistical nalysis. 
2. Lexical variables: Certain negation particles 
(ovd~ei?, otu~rere, oo~o4zo6, dryer)clearly 
signify a preference for Katharevousa while 
others (~51Xo~?, #are, Xcopi?) are clear 
indicators of Demotiki. However, the most 
frequently used negation particles (tzt,/a/v, 
~cv) are not characteristic ofeither of the two 
variations. 
3. Structural macro-features: average sentence 
length, number of commas, dashes and 
brackets (total of 4 variables). 
4. After the completion of the experiments with 
variables of type 1-3 (Tambouratzis et al, 
2000), Part-of-Speech (PoS) counts were 
introduced. The PoS categories were 
adjectives, adjunedons, adverbs, articles, 
conjunctions, nouns, pronouns, numerals, 
particles, verbs and a hold-all category (for 
non-classifiable ntries), resulting in 11 
variables expressed as percentages. 
These variables are more similar to the 
characteristics used by Karlgren (1999), and 
differ considerably from those used by Kilgarriff 
(1996) and Baayen et al (1996). For the metrics 
of the first and thkd categories, a custom-built 
program was used running under Linux. This 
program calculated all structural and 
morphological metrics for each text in a single 
pass and the results were processed with the help 
of a spreadsheet package. The metrics of the 
second category were calculated using a custom- 
built program in the C programming language. 
PoS counts were obtained using the ILSP tagger 
(Papageorgiou et al, 2000) coupled with a 
number of custom-built programs to determine 
the actual frequencies-of-occurrence from the 
tagged texts. Finally, the STATGRAPHICS 
package was used for the statistical nalysis. 
The dataset selected consisted of examples from 
three registers: 
(i) fiction (364 Kwords - 24 texts), 
(ii) texts of academic prose referring to 
historical issues, also referred to as the 
history register (361 Kwords - 32 texts) and 
(iii) political speeches obtained from the 
proceedings of the Greek parliament 
sessions, also referred to as the parliament 
register (509 Kwords - 12 texts). 
The texts of registers (I) and (II) were retrieved 
from the ILSP corpus (Gavrilidou et al, 1998), 
all of them dating from the period 1991-1999. 
The texts of register (III) were transcripts of the 
Greek Parliament sessions held during the first 
half of 1999. 
This dataset was processed using both seeded 
and unseeded clustering techniques with between 
3 and 6 clusters. The unseeded approach 
confirmed the existence of distinct natural 
classes, which correspond to the three registers. 
The seeded approach confirmed the ability to 
accurately separate these three registers and to 
cluster their elements together. Initially, a "short" 
data vector containing only the 12 morphological 
variables quantifying the Demofiki/Katharevousa 
contrast was used (Tambouratzis etal. 2000), as 
well as a 16-element vector combining structural 
and morphological characteristics. The seeds for 
the Parliaraent and History registers were chosen 
randomly. The seeds for the Fiction register were 
chosen so that at least one of them would not be 
36 
an "outlier" of the Fiction register. 
Representative results are shown in Table 1 for 
the different vectors and numbers of clusters. In 
each case, the classification rate quoted 
corresponds to the number of text elements 
correctly classified (according to the register of 
the respective seed).

3 clust. 95.6% 97.1% 
Table 1 - Seeded clustering accuracy as a 
function of  the cluster number and vector size. 
The vector size was augmented with PoS 
information, resulting in a 27-element data 
vector. A new set of clustering experiments were 
performed using Ward's method with the 
squared Euclidean distance measure to cluster 
the data in an unseeded manner. Finally, a 15- 
element data vector was used with PoS and 
structural information but without any 
morphological information. The results obtained 
(Table 2) show that PoS information improves 
the clustering performance. 
2.2 Comments on the Results 
Our results strongly suggest hat registers of 
written Modem Greek can be discriminated 
accurately on the basis of the contrast 
Katharevousa / Demotiki manifested with 
morphological variation. Languages with a 
different history may not be suited to such a 
categorisafion method. This is evident in Biber's 
work (1995) for the English language, where a 
variety of grammatical and macro-structural 
linguistic features but no morphological variation 
features were employed. It seems then that 
corpora of languages which are characterised by 
the phenomenon of diglossia, may be 
successfully categorisable on the basis of 
morphological information (or other reflexes of 
diglossia). Such a discrimination method may 
give results as satisfactory as approaches which 
are closer to the Biber (1995) spirit and rely on 
PoS and structural measures (see Tables 1 and 
2). 
Tables 1 and 2 show that the accuracy of 
clustering reaches approximately 99% while the 
seeded clustering approach ad a high degree of 
accuracy, reaching 100% when using 5 clusters. 
For the 27-element vector with both 
morphological and PoS information, perfect 
clustering has been achieved even with 4 
clusters. On the other hand, a successful 
clustering (albeit with a lower level of accuracy) 
is achieved using only structural and PoS 
information. 
It should be noted that the lexical variables used, 
that is the negation particles, did not contribute at 
all (Markantonatou et al, 2000). Furthermore, 
the system performed almost as well with and 
without macro-structure features, the difference 
in accuracy being less than 5%. 
The parliament texts can be claimed to form a 
register whose patterns are closely positioned in 
the pattern space. Of the three registers, the 
literature one presented the highest degree of 
variance, with more than one sub-clusters 
existing as well as outlier elements. This may be 
explained by the fact that the parliament 
proceedings, contrary to literature, undergo 
intensive diting by a small group of specialised 
public servants. 
3 Distinguishing Styles within One 
Register 
In this section, we report on our efforts to 
distinguish among individual styles within one 
register. In particular, we intend to distinguish 
among speakers of the Parliament by studying 
the transcripts of the speeches of five parliament 
members over the period 1997-2000. Each of 
these speakers belongs to one of the five political 
parties that were represented in the Greek 
parliament over that period. Up to date, the 
experiments have been limited to the period 
1999-2000. 
3.1 Method of work 
The number of variables (46 in total) calculated 
for each of the five speakers can be grouped as

The last two types of variable are expressed 
as percentages normalised over the number

2. Lexical variables (6 variables): 
? Negation particles (623, &v,/aft). 
? Negative words of Katharevousa (ovJei?, 
~iveo). 
? Other words which also express the 
contrast Katharevousa / Demotiki (the 
anaphoric pronouns 'o~oio?' (Kath) and 
'taro' (Dem)), currently resulting in a 
single variable. 
3. Structural macro-features: average sentence 
and word length, number of commas, 
question marks, dashes and brackets, 
resulting in a total of 6 variables. 
4. Structural micro-features (other than 
lexical): 
? Part-of-Speech ounts (10 variables). 
? Use of grammatical categories such as 
the genitive case with nouns and 
adjectives (2 variables). 
5. The year when the speech was presented in
the Parliament and the order of the speech in 
the daily schedule, that is whether it was the 
first speech of the speaker that clay (hereafter 
denoted as "protoloyia") or the second, third 
etc. (resulting in a total of 2 variables). 
6. The identity of the speaker, denoted as the 
speaker Signature (1 variable), which was 
used to determine the desired classification. 
Similarly to the clustering experiments, a set of 
C programs was used to extract automatically the 
values of the aforementioned variables from the 
transcripts. Most of these programs rely on 
measuring the occurrence of di-gram% and more 
generally n-grams, for letters, words and tagsets, 
thus being straight-forward. In the case of 
speaker identification, Discriminant Analysis 
was used, as the clustering approach did not give 
very good results, indicating that the distinction 
among personal styles is weaker than that among 
registers. Even when only 2 speakers were used, 
the clusters formed involved patterns from both 
speaker classes. 
We experimented with two corpora, Corpus I and 
Corpus 11, as described in Table 3. Corpus H is a 
subset of Corpus I. Each of the speeches 
included in Corpus II was delivered as an 
opening speech Cprotoloyia") at a parliament 
session when at least wo of the studied speakers 
delivered speeches. 
An important issue is whether the selected 
variables are strongly correlated. If indeed strong 
correlations do exist, these might be used to 
reduce the dimensionality of the pattern space. 
For the purposes of this analysis, the 46 
independent variables were used (45 in the case 
of Corpus II where only "protoioyiai" exist, since 
then the order variable is constantly equal to 1). 
The number of correlations of all variable pairs 
exceeding iven thresholds i depicted in Figure 
1, for both Corpus I and Corpus 11. According 
to this study, in Corpus IL the percentage of 
variable pairs with an absolute value of 
correlation exceeding 0.5 is approximately 3%, 
indicating a low correlation between the 
parameters. Additionally, out of 990 pairs of 
Corpus 11, only a single one has a correlation 
exceeding 0.8. The correlations for the same 
parameter pairs over the two corpora re similar, 
though as a rule the correlation for Corpus I is 
less that that for Corpus 11, reflecting the larger 
variability of texts in Corpus I. The correlation 
study indicated that most of the parameters are 
not strongly correlated. Thus, a factor analysis 
step is not necessary and the application of the 
diseriminant analysis directly on the original 
variables i  justified. 
Initially, Corpus I (see Table 3) was processed. 
The 46 aforementioned variables were used to 
generate discriminant functions accurately 
recognising the identity of the speaker. To that 
end, three different approaches were used: 
(i) the full model: all variables were used to 
determine the discriminant functions; 
38 
(ii) the forward model: starting from an 
empty model, variables were introduced in 
order to create a reduced model, with a 
small number of variables; 
(iii) the backward model: starting from the full 
model, variables were eliminated to create 
a reduced model. 
In the cases of the forward and backward 
models, the values of the F parameter to both 
enter and delete a variable were set to 4 while the 
maximum number of steps to generate the model 
was set to 50.

Table 3 - Comparative composition of 
Corpus I and Corpus 11. 
The performance ofthis model is improved if: 
I. the order in which each particular speech 
was delivered is taken into account: the 
subset of "protoloyiai" is well-defined and 
presents a low variance while the speeches of 
second or lower order have a higher 
variance. 
2. the corpus comprises only sessions where 
more than one speaker has delivered 
speeches. Thus, the more balanced Corpus II 
(Table 3) presents an improved 
discrimination performance. 
For these two corpora, the results of the 
diseriminant analysis are shown in Table 4. The 
discrimination rate obtained with Corpus II is 
much higher than that for Corpus I. In addition, 
smaller models, with 8 variables, may be created 
that correctly classify at least 75% of Corpus II. 
An example of the factors generated and the 
manner in which they separate the pattern space 
is shown in the diagrams of Figure 2. 
3.2 Comments  on the Results 
Though this research is continuing, certain facts 
can be reported with confidence. 
Within the Greek Parliament Proceedings 
register, individual styles can not be classified on 
the basis of morphological features expressing 
the contrast Katharevousa/Demotiki. This may 
be explained by the fact that these texts undergo 
intensive diting towards a well-established sub- 
language. This editing homogenises the 
morphological profile of the texts but, of course, 
does not go as far as homogenising the lexical 
preferences of the various speakers. That is why, 
contrary to the register-clustering experiments, 
lexical variables expressing the particular 
contrast seem to play a role in discriminating 
between speakers and why the use of 
Katharevousa-odented n gative particles, which 
was not important in register discrimination, 
seems to be of some importance in style 
discrimination. The observation that negative 
words play a role in style identification is in 
agreement with the observations ofLabb6 (1983) 
on the French political speech. 
Structural features have turned out to be 
important: the average word length, the use of 
punctuation and question marks and the use of 
certain parts-of-speech such as articles, 
conjunctions, adjuncfions and - especiaUy - 
verbs. Furthermore, the distribution of verbs into 
persons and numbers seems to be important, 
though the exact variables selected differ 
depending on the exact set of speeches used 
(these variables are of course complementary). 
One of the most interesting findings of this 
research is that it is important whether the 
speaker delivers a "protoloyia" or not. 
"Protoloyiai" can be classified at a rate of 95% 
while mixed deliveries result in a lower rate, as 
low as 75%. This may be caused by two factors: 
1. "Protoloyiai" represent longer stretches of 
text, which are more characteristic ofa given 
speaker. 
2. Speakers prepare meticulously for their 
"protoloyiai" while their other deliveries 
represent a more spontaneous type of speech, 
which tends to contain patterns hared by all 
the parliament members. 
Finally, certain additional patterns are emerging 
for each of the speakers. Certain speakers (e.g. 
speaker A) are more consistently recognised than 
others (e.g. speaker B) while speaker B is similar 
to speaker C and speaker D is similar to speaker 
E. This indicates that additional variables may be 
required to improve the classification accuracy 
for all speakers.

4 Future Plans 5 Conclusions 
As a next step, frequency of use of certain 
lemmata shall be imroduced since visual 
inspection indicates that they may provide good 
discriminatory features. We also plan to 
substitute average lengths (of both words and 
sentences) with the distribution of lengths. 
Furthermore, we intend to introduce certain 
structural measurements such as repetition of 
structures, chains of nominals and the occurrence 
of negation within NP phrasal eousdments. 
Another possible extension involves the 
inclusion of the speech topic. As certain 
speakers' characteristics seem to change through 
time, we plan to process the entire corpus of 
speeches for the target period 1997/-2000. 
Finally, an important issue is the comparison of 
the results obtained in our experiments o these 
generatedby alternative t chniques proposed by 
other researchers. This will allow the deduction 
of more accurate conclusions regarding the 
strengths and the weaknesses of the research 
strategies. 
In this article, ongoing research on register and 
individual style eategorisation f written Modem 
Greek has been reported. A system has been 
proposed for the automatic register 
categorisafion of corpora in Modem Greek 
exploiting the highly inflectional nature of the 
language. The results have been obtained with a 
relatively constrained set of registers; however 
their recognition accuracy is remarkably high, 
exceeding 98% with an unseeded clustering 
approach using between 3and 6 clusters. 
On the front of individual style categorisation, a 
discrimination rate of over 80% was achieved for 
five speakers within the Greek Parliament 
register. Morphological variables were shown to 
be of less importance to this task, while lexieal 
and straetural variables eemed to take over. We 
are planning to introduce several new lexical and 
structural variables in order to achieve better 
discrimination rates and to determine 
discriminating features of the different styles.

APPENDIX 
Characteristics 
Demotiki 
of Katharevousa and 
Diglossia in Modem Greek is due to the contrast 
between Katharevousa and Demotiki and is well- 
manifested on the morphological level. Here we 
concentrate on verb morphology. 
Demotiki tends to have words ending with an 'open' 
syllable. So, 3 r~ Plural verbal endings in -n (1) are 
augmented to -ne (2). 
(1) ~ \[e'leyan\] (Kath ) (=they said) 
(2) 2b/etw \[le'yane\] (Dem) (=they said) 
In Demotik/, Katharevousa's consonant dusters of 
two fricatives or two plosives are convened into 
clusters of one fricative and one plosive (3) - (4) 
(Holton et al, 1997, pp. 14). 
(3) nmtrOtb \[pis0o'\]/n~zortb \[pisto'\] (=to be 
convinced) 
(4) ga2mpOd~ \[kalifSo'\]/xczivffrd~ \[kalifto'\] (--to be 
covered) 
Certain verb classes exhibit thematic vowel 
alternations either following the inflectional paradigm 
of Ancient Greek or Demotiki (5) (Clairis and 
Babiniotis, 1999). 
(5) e~aprdtraz \[eksarta'te\] ( Kath ) l e~odrakrou 
\[eksartiete\] (Dem) (=depends) 
Sometimes Deraotiki uses a verbal root, which is 
similar though not identical to the Katharevousa one 
(6). 
(6) AfioJ \[li'o\] (Kath)/2fivxo Oi" no\] (Dem ) (=to solve) 
Finally, many verbs inherited from Katharevausa
