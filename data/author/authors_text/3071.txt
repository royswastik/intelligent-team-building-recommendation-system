Abstract 
In this paper we describe a neural networks 
approach to generation. The task is to generate 
sentences with hotel-information from a 
structured atabase. The system is inspired by 
Karen Kukich's ANA, but expands on it by 
adding generality in the form of language 
independence in representations and lexical 
look-up. 
Introduction 
In the growing field of intelligent 
communication (web-browsers, dialogue 
systems, etc.) the need for a flexible generator 
has become more important (e.g. Hovy & Lin, 
1999). NLG is usually seen as a two-stage 
process where the planning component akes 
care of the inter-sentential content planning, 
while the surface realisation component 
transforms the content representation i to a 
string of words. Interactions between the two 
components have called for the micro-planning 
stage to be postulated in the middle, but still the 
rule-based pipeline architecture has problems 
with sequential rules and their two-way 
relations. Statistical approaches have been 
developed, and seem to provide flexibility to 
generation tasks. 
The approach taken in this thesis, however, 
explores generation as .a .classification task 
whereby the representation that describes the 
intended meaning of the utterance is ultimately 
to be classified into an appropriate surface form. 
Although the task as such is a complex one, the 
approach allows its decomposition i to a series 
of smaller classification tasks tbrmulated as 
input-output mappings rather than step-wise 
rules. One of the goals of the thesis is to study 
the ways generation could .be broken down into 
suitable sub-classification tasks so as to enhance 
flexibility in the generation process in general. 
Artificial neural networks are a classification 
technique that is robust and resistant o noisy 
input, and learns to classify inputs on the basis 
of training examples, without specific rules that 
describe how the classification is to be done. 
There is not much research into using ANN's for 
generation, the main reason being long training 
times. Two notable exceptions are Kukich 
(1987) and Ward (1997), both argue in favour of 
NN's robustness, but at the same time point out 
problems with scalability. We believe that with 
improved computer facilities that shorten the 
training time, this new way of looking at 
generation as a classification task constitutes an 
interesting approach to generation. We have 
chosen Kukich's approach, as our application 
domain is to generate utterances from structured 
databases. 
This paper is structured as follows; we first 
discuss the general model. The second part 
briefly describes neural networks. We continue 
with describing a possible implementation f the 
model, and finally we draw some conclusions 
and point to future challenges. 
1 The model 
The task chosen for the system is to generate 
sentences. with information about hotels. The 
information is presented in a structured way in a 
database. It is assumed that certain features and 
values are given as input to the system.. The 
system's task is then to generate a syntactically 
(and semantically) well-formed sentence as a 
response to some user request, based on the 
239 
information it gets from the database. These are 
some example sentences the model will be able 
to generate: 
The hotel Regina has twenty rooms. 
The hotel Regina is a small hotel. 
The hotel Regina has thirty single rooms 
The hotel Regina is an expensive hotel. 
The hOtel Regina is.an expensi~e~hotel.in:lhe:city . ~. 
center and the single room price is 4000 BEF. 
A single room costs 2000 BEF. 
In Karen Kukich's stock-reporter system ANA 
the task is divided into two parts, represented by 
two neural networks, one sememe-to-morpheme 
network and one morpheme-to-phrase network. 
Facts about the status of the stock market were 
given to the network as semantic attributes. The 
network was trainde to map eight possible 
semantic attributes onto morphemes marked for 
semantic attributes. These morphemes were then 
linearized in the second network. 
The output of Kukich's first net is a set of 
English morphemes. The actual morphemes are 
present on the output nodes of the net (72 
possible morphemes). This makes the whole 
system both language dependent and difficult to 
modify. In order to add a morpheme to the list of 
possible morphemes the whole network must be 
modified. 
In order to introduce more flexibili~, the task 
could be broken into a language hTdependent 
and a language dependent task. The database 
facts are not dependent on which langmage they 
are represented in. Instead of letting the output 
nodes stand for actual morphemes they could 
represent he different roles the elements can 
play in a sentence. Part of the output will stand 
for the s,Lbject or theme of the final sentece. The 
mental space theory of Fauconnier (1985) 
provides an attractive way qf presenting the 
relations between the facts without commiting 
oneself to a particular langTmge. The output of 
Neural Network I (NN I) will therefbre be 
interpreted as an event space, or template, that 
can be used for language dependent generation. 
The actual values on the output nodes refer to a 
concept stored in a lexicon. 
There is also a discourse model in the system, 
which receives information about which features 
in the database are relevant for the next 
sentence. It also determines the level of 
generalisation required for the output. Consider 
the two following sentences: 
A double room costs 3000 BEF and a single 
room costs .5000 BEE in hotel Regina. 
Hotel Regina is expensive. 
Saying exactly how much something costs and 
saying how expensive or cheap it is, is just two 
ways of communicating the same thing. Both 
sentences are based on the same facts. Which 
sentence is chosen may depend on the level of 
specificity required. This problem of synonymy 
is present in various ways in all language 
generation systems. Kukich has an example of 
two phrases in her system corresponding to the 
exact same semantic values (or "sememes"). To 
get around the problem she added two extra 
sememes to the input and assigned them random 
values. In this model we have also introduced an 
extra input category, but it serves as a feature 
telling the network whether to output he general 
or the specific sentence. 
In Kukich's network the task of the second 
network is the ordering of the morphemes into a 
syntactic string. The second network in this 
model will also have to order the concepts and 
map them onto forms that can represent real 
words in a language. We now also have the 
advantage of having the event space to help the 
network generate the real sentence. 
h7 English sentences there are phenomena such 
as agreement that may span over several words 
in a sentence. The target sentences above show 
agT"eement between subject and verb, in other 
languages e.g. Norwegian there is agreement 
between adjectives and the nouns they mod~. 
There have been experiments using neural nets 
to recognise relationships based on constituencv 
and syntactic structure in sentences. Elman 
(1989 and 1990) has shown that neural nets can 
learn to represent the concept of word, 
240 
constituency and structural relations by 
introducing the concept of time into the 
processing of the representations. Elman takes 
as a starting point a neural networks 
architechture first described by Jordan (1986). 
The novel approach is to represent time by the 
effect it has on processing and not as an 
additional dimension on the input. The solution 
consists .in giving, the~sk~stem memory. This is 
done by introducing a fourth type of units, called 
context units, into the network apart from the 
typical input, hidden and output units. At each 
cycle the hidden unit activations are copied onto 
the context units. In the following cycle the 
context nodes combine with the new input to 
activate the hidden units. 
Elman poses the problem of whether a network 
can learn underlying aspects of sentence 
structure from word order. For the simulation he 
used 15 different sentence templates capable of 
being filled with nouns and verbs. He used six 
different classes of nouns (human, animate, etc.) 
and six different classes of verbs (transitive, 
intransitive tc.). The network was trained on 
random two or three word sentences. The 
network was supposed to learn to predict the 
order of successive words. For any given 
sequence of words there are a limited number of 
possible successors. It is impossible to know 
with absolute certainty which word follows the 
previous, but generalisations can be made based 
on type of verb (e.g. a noun should not be 
expected to follow an intransitive verb). The 
performance of the network was therefore 
measured according to the expected frequencies 
of occurrence of possible successors, not which 
word in reality occurred. 
On the basis of the training the network 
developed internal representations which 
reflected the facts about the possible sequential 
ordering of the inputs. 
"The network is not able to predict he 
precise order of words, but recognizes 
that (in this cot79us) there is a class of 
inputs Ozamelv, verb.i) that .typically 
Jollow other inputs (namely, nouns). 
This knowledge of class behavior" is 
quite detailed, form the fact that there is 
a class of items which always precedes 
"chase ", "bread", "smash ", it infers 
that the large animals form a class. " 
(Elman 1990, p. 199) 
He also succeeds in representing agreement 
between subject and verb, even in sentences 
like: 
Dog \[who chases cat\] sees girl 
This method of teaching a network the relation 
between different words in a sentence could also 
be exploited for language generation. The 
network can be trained on possible sentence 
structures and agreement between the elements 
in the sentence. As a starting point the sentence 
types of the example sentences above could be 
used. In a symbolic system they could be 
represented by the following phrase structure 
rules, depending on the language in question: 
S ~NP VP 
NP "-~ DET (MOD) N 
VP ~ V NP 
PP --) P NP 
Each of the categories (N, P etc.) will be output 
nodes of  NN II according to the lhwar order 
they may occur in the language in question, and 
in addition there will be placeholders for" 
number on nouns, verbs and modifiers. The 
output of NN 11 is now a linear" structure where 
we Iozou, the phrase types. This irformation 
could e.g. be used by a text-to-speech system to 
assig71 stress to certain word etc. 
Our model can now be represented like this:

2 Brief introduction to neural networks 
242 
An artificial neural network is a metaphor of the 
way human and other mammalian brains work. 
The biological brain consists of a great number 
of interacting elements, neuron. A neuron 
collects electrical impulses inside the cell 
membrane. If the level of impulses reaches a 
certain threshold, the neuron will generate an 
action potential, a pulse that travels along a thin 
fibre to other.neurons,.~oausing Ihem to-.store-the 
electrical impulse. Each neuron may have 
synaptic connections to thousands of other 
neurons. 
An artificial neural network consists of nodes or 
units, modelled on neurons. These nodes can 
receive and transfer activation. Each node is 
connected to many other nodes, and the strength 
or efficiency of each connection is determined 
by a weight. Together with the nodes the 
connections are the most salient features of a 
neural network. The weights on the connections 
can be modified by learning rules, enabling the 
network to learn new tasks. There are several 
types of learning algorithms that may be used to 
train neural networks, but back propagation is
probably the most common one. During training, 
an input/output pair is presented to the network. 
After a whole set of input/output pairs have been 
run through the network the back propagation 
algorithm calculates how far the actual output of 
the net is from the desired output, and the 
weights on the connections adjusted in the right 
direction. If there is any overall pattern to the 
data, or some consistent relationship between the 
inputs and results of each record, the network 
should be able to eventually create an internal 
mapping of weights that can accurately 
reproduce the expected output. Since the 
knowledge the network acquires is a result of the 
mappings, how the input and output is 
represented is of great importance. 
3 Implementation

information i the database:

The feature selector fetches the necessary values 
(determined by the discourse model) and inputs 
them to NN I. The input vector is eleven units 
long. Ten units are the local representations of 
the features in the database and the last unit 
represents the generalizer feature from the 
discourse model. The Stuttgart Neural Networks 
Simulator (SNNS 2) which will be used for the 
implementation ly allows values between -1 
and 1, so the numerical values will be 
normalized to fit into the vector. This is also 
necessary so the relative importance of the 
different features are not out of proportion. 
The event space in the output will consist of the 
tbllowing elements: 
(see table 1 at the end) 
The vocabulary needed for the generation task is 
represented by binary codes, e.g. based on the 
alphabetical order of the forms. If we let the 
subject/theme part of the vector be 7 units long 
I At the moment we deal only with hotel info.

we can represent 27 (128) different word with 
numerical values. 0000001 is concept number 1, 
00000 !0 is concept number 2 and so on.

In table 2 are some example inputs and outputs, 
a 1 represents activation on an input or output 
node. 
Now that we have a language independent 
representation f the sentence we would like to 
generate, it needs to be cast into a sentence in a 
natural language. The languages of this system 
will be English and Norwegian, but the intention 
is that other languages may also be represented. 
These input-output combinations shown above 
should ultimately correspond to the tbllowing 
target sentences (after NN II and post 
processing): 
l) The hotel Regina has twen O, single rooms. 
Hotell Regina har tjue enkeltrom. 
4) A double room costs seven thousand Belgian 
francs and a single room costs four thousand 
Belgian J~ancs. 
Et dobbeltrom koster syv tusen belgiske franc 
og et enkeltrom koster fire tusen belgiske 
franc. 
5) The hotel Regina is expensive. 
. . . . . . .  '~:~4totetb Regina:er dyrt. . . . . . .  
6) The hotel Ariadne is a cheap hotel in the city 
centre. 
Hotell Ariadne er et billig hotell i sentrum. 
The whole output vector is shown in table 3. 
NN II must be trained on agreement. This is 
done by teaching it to discover relationships, 
such as the fact that the feature SINGULAR on 
the subject noun, is associated with the feature 
SINGULAR on the main verb. The input nodes 
on Network II will be similar to the output of the 
first net, but the input will be fed sequentially to 
the network (theme, number, main_event, 
complement e c. 
If we assume that the output ofNN I now serves 
as the input for NN lI, this will be our desired 
output (only the activated nodes are shown 
here):

and so on... 
244 
After a look-up in an English dictionary we find 
that the singular form of BE is is, and the plural 
form of SINGLE_ROOM is single rooms. The 
reason we do not outPUt this directly is that we 
would then require different output nodes for all 
the different forms of a word. Instead we 
combine the word with the feature to find the 
correct morphological form. Numbers could in 
fact be ? processed.by a~speci.almuml:mr~.,grammar 
to avoid having to list all numbers in a lexicon. 
These tasks could of course also be solved using 
other neural networks. 
The nodes in the output vector represents 
different syntactic ategories, so we also get a 
surface syntactic structure directly output from 
the net, which could be used for stress 
information etc. to be input to a speech 
generator. 
4 Results 
The two networks were trained using 
backpropagation with momentum (learning rate 
0.5), each training set consisting of 57 sentences 
was run for 600 cycles. For the first network the 
mean square error (MSE) was 0.08, for the 
second network 0.175. The number of hidden 
nodes in each network was 20, a higher or lower 
number of hidden nodes resulted in a higher 
MSE. 
Using a threshold value of 0.8, the network 
could be said to have correctly learned the 
mapping from output o input activations.

Conclusion 
Extensive experimentation is needed to define 
the proper typology and parameters for the 
neural networks. We especially need to 
experiment more with different learning 
methods. A future research topic will be to see 
what kinds of further subdivision of the tasks are 
needed. Elman suggests that simple recurrent 
networks could be capable of learning 
pronominal reference, and this would be an 
interesting extension of the system.
