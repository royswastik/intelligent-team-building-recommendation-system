Abstract 
 
We describe the design and 
implementation of a question answering 
(QA) system called QARAB. It is a 
system that takes natural language 
questions expressed in the Arabic 
language and attempts to provide short 
answers. The system?s primary source 
of knowledge is a collection of Arabic 
newspaper text extracted from Al-Raya, 
a newspaper published in Qatar. During 
the last few years the information 
retrieval community has attacked this 
problem for English using standard IR 
techniques with only mediocre success. 
We are tackling this problem for Arabic 
using traditional Information Retrieval 
(IR) techniques coupled with a 
sophisticated Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) approach. To identify 
the answer, we adopt a keyword 
matching strategy along with matching 
simple structures extracted from both 
the question and the candidate 
documents selected by the IR system. 
To achieve this goal, we use an existing 
tagger to identify proper names and 
other crucial lexical items and build 
lexical entries for them on the fly.  We 
also carry out an analysis of Arabic 
question forms and attempt a better 
understanding of what kinds of answers 
users find satisfactory.  The paucity of 
studies of real users has limited results 
in earlier research. 
 
1 Introduction 
 
In recent years, there has been a marked increase 
in the amount of data available on the Internet.   
Users often have specific questions in mind, for 
which they hope to get answers. They would like 
the answers to be short and precise, and they 
always prefer to express the questions in their 
native language without being restricted to a 
specific query language, query formation rules, or 
even a specific knowledge domain. The new 
approach taken to matching the user needs is to 
carry out actual analysis of the question from a 
linguistic point of view and to attempt to 
understand what the user really means.  
 QARAB is the result of coupling traditional 
Information Retrieval (IR) techniques with a 
sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
approach. The approach can be summarized as 
follows: the IR system treats the question as a 
query in an attempt to identify the candidate 
 documents that may contain the answer; then the 
NLP techniques are used to parse the question and 
analyze the top ranked documents returned by the 
IR system. 
 Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the 
Arabic language is still in its initial stage 
compared to the work in the English language, 
which has already benefited from the extensive 
research in this field.  There are some aspects that 
slow down progress in Arabic Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) compared to the 
accomplishments in English and other European 
languages [Al-Daimi & Abdel-Amir, 1994]. 
These aspects include: 
? Arabic is highly inflectional and derivational, 
which makes morphological analysis a very 
complex task. 
? The absence of diacritics (which represent 
most vowels) in the written text creates 
ambiguity and therefore, complex 
morphological rules are required to identify 
the tokens and parse the text. 
? The writing direction is from right-to-left and 
some of the characters change their shapes 
based on their location in the word. 
? Capitalization is not used in Arabic, which 
makes it hard to identify proper names, 
acronyms, and abbreviations. 
 
In addition to the above linguistic issues, there 
is also a lack of Arabic corpora, lexicons, and 
machine-readable dictionaries, which are essential to 
advance research in different areas. 
 
 
2 Background 
 
Advances in natural language processing (NLP), 
information retrieval techniques (IR), information 
extraction (IE), as well as the computer industry, 
have given QA a strong boost. Modern question-
answering systems have started incorporating 
NLP techniques to parse natural language 
documents, extract entities and relations between 
entities, resolve anaphora, and other language 
ambiguities [Harabagiu et al, 2000; Vicedo & 
Ferr?ndez, 2000].   
 Research in Question-Answering (QA) is not 
new.  The QA problem has been addressed in the 
literature since the beginning of computing 
machines.  The AI/NLP communities initiated 
traditional work to address question-answering 
using structural methods. Early experiments in 
this direction implemented systems that operate in 
very restricted domains (e.g. SHRDLU 
[Winogard, 1972] and LUNAR [Woods, 1972]).   
In the QUALM system, Lehnert [1978] took a 
further step, based on the conceptual theories of 
Schank & Abelson [1977], to understand the 
nature of the questions and classify them in a way 
similar to how human beings understand and 
answer questions. SCISOR [Jacobs & Rau 1990] 
aimed at question answering and text extraction 
more than information retrieval. It combined 
natural language processing, knowledge 
representation, and information retrieval 
techniques with lexical analysis and word-based 
text searches. The MURAX system [Kupiec, 
1993] used robust linguistic methods to answer 
closed-class natural language questions. It 
presented the user with relevant text in which 
noun phrases are marked. A less automated 
approach like Ask Jeeves [1996] approached the 
QA problem by pointing the questioner to Web 
links that might contain information relevant to 
the answer to the question. Ask Jeeves benefited 
from advanced natural language processing 
techniques combined with data mining processing 
and a huge expanding knowledge base. Another 
system, with a different approach, is the 
FAQFinder system [Burke et al, 1997], which 
attempted to solve the question-answering 
problem using a database of question-answer pairs 
built from existing frequently asked question 
(FAQ) files.  Two other important systems are the 
START system [Katz, 1997], which is based on 
annotations from the Web and the Q&A system 
[Budzik & Hammond, 1999], which is a 
semiautomatic, natural language question-
answering and referral system. The system is 
based on a huge knowledge base and human 
experts who volunteered their time to respond to 
the users? questions. 
 Recently, attention has begun to be focused 
on developing question-answering systems that do 
 not rely on a knowledge base and that can fetch 
answers from huge unstructured text.  New QA 
systems enhanced with NLP and IR techniques 
have been developed to extract textual answers for 
open-domain questions and provide a framework 
for modern information retrieval [TREC-8, 1999; 
TREC-9, 2000].  
 The overall aim of this QA track was to 
retrieve small pieces of text that contain the actual 
answer to the question rather than the list of 
documents traditionally returned by retrieval 
engines [Voorhees & Tice, 2000].  The TREC-8 
QA track attracted researchers from both industry 
and academia. Twenty organizations participated 
in this track with different approaches and their 
systems were evaluated.  The participating 
systems were tested on a huge set of unstructured 
documents and a set of fact-based questions.   
 Generally speaking, most of the TREC-8 
long-string answer (250-bytes) participants 
attempted to solve the QA problem from the 
information retrieval (IR) point of view by 
locating the most relevant documents from the 
collection and then extracting the sentences most 
relevant to the query from the documents just 
located. The systems relying on this ?bag-of-
words? approach (e.g. [Allan et al, 1999]; 
[Cormack et al, 1999]; [Lin & Chen, 1999]; [Shin 
et al, 1999] and the passage-retrieval run of 
AT&T [Singhal et al, 1999]) deal with the 
question without considering its grammatical or 
semantic characteristics and they apply 
conventional IR techniques to extract the answer.  
Even though the ?bag-of-words? approach was 
commonly used in TREC-8, the systems based on 
this approach were inadequate to handle the short-
string (50-byte) answers. 
 On the contrary, the short string (50-byte) 
participants (e.g. [Breck et al, 1999]; [Ferret et 
al., 1999]; [Hull, 1999]; [Humphreys et al, 1999]; 
[Litkowski, 1999]; [Moldovan et al, 2000]; [Oard 
et al, 1999]; [Singhal et al, 1999]) agreed on the 
importance of applying several natural language 
processing techniques to solve the problem.  
Among these techniques are: part-of-speech 
tagging, shallow parsing, query type identification 
and named entity recognition.  Because the 
number of test documents to be analyzed for each 
query was huge, the majority of the systems in 
this band used the ?bag-of-words? approach as an 
initial step to retrieve the relevant passages that 
contain the possible answer. Another approach to 
the QA problem combines IR techniques with 
Information Extraction (IE) techniques for 
extracting named entities, e.g., [Ogden et al, 
1999]; [Takaki, 1999]; and [Srihari & Li, 1999]. 
A detailed description of the track and the results 
are available at [Voorhees & Tice, 1999]. 
 It is obvious from the increasing number of 
systems participating in TREC-9 and the 
worldwide interest in this research area that 
Question Answering is the most promising 
framework for finding answers to natural 
language questions from a huge amount of textual 
data.  Cardie et al [2000] pointed out that 
building ?open-ended question answering systems 
that allow users to pose questions of any type and 
in any language, without domain restrictions, is 
still beyond the scope of any QA system today? (p. 
180).  Harabagiu et al [2000] indicated that 
advanced tools (such as dialog understanding and 
text mining) are essential for the success of future 
QA systems. Until the advanced tools are 
implemented, she suggested that we keep 
approximating the complexity of Question 
Answering with NLP enhancements of IR and IE 
techniques [Harabagiu et al, 2000]. 
 
 
3 QARAB System 
 
3.1 Overview 
 
In the last decade, the volume of Arabic 
textual data has started growing on the Web and 
Arabic software for browsing the Web is 
improving.  Unfortunately, much of the earlier 
Arabic text available on the Web was posted as 
images, which makes it unsuitable for search or 
processing. As of today, there is an increase in the 
amount of Arabic textual material available on the 
Web in the form of news articles and books.  
 The main goal of the QARAB system is to 
identify text passages that answer a natural 
language question. The task can be summarized as 
follows: Given a set of questions expressed in 
 Arabic, find answers to the questions under the 
following assumptions: 
? The answer exists in a collection of Arabic 
newspaper text extracted from the Al-Raya 
newspaper published in Qatar. 
? The answer does not span through documents 
(i.e. all supporting information for the answer 
lies in one document) 
? The answer is a short passage. 
 
 
The basic QA processing in QARAB is 
composed of three major steps: 
? Processing the input question 
? Retrieving the candidate documents 
(paragraphs) containing answers from the IR 
system 
? Processing each one of the candidate 
documents (paragraphs) in the same way as 
the question is processed and returning 
sentences that may contain the answer. 
 
The QARAB system will be evaluated over a 
wide range of question types provided by Arabic 
users during the testing and the final phases. The 
same users will then assess whether the answers 
produced by the system are satisfactory. 
 
 
3.2 QARAB Structure 
  
The complete QARAB system is depicted in 
Figure 1; it has the following overall structure: 
 
 
3.2.1 The IR System    
 
The IR system, which we are implementing from 
scratch, is based on Salton?s vector space model 
[Salton, 1971]. First, it processes the text 
collection from the Al-Raya newspaper and 
constructs an inverted file system, from which the 
answers to the natural language questions will be 
extracted. The purpose of the IR system is to 
search the document collection to select 
documents containing information relevant to the 
user?s query. 
Implementing the Information Retrieval 
System 
 
Information Retrieval (IR) systems can be 
constructed in many various ways.  Lundquist et 
al. [1999] proposed an Information Retrieval (IR) 
system that can be constructed using a relational 
database management system (RDBMS). Our IR 
system is depicted in Figure 2 and it contains the 
following database relations: 
? ROOT_TABLE (Root_ID, Root) ? to store the 
available distinct roots of the terms extracted 
from the Al-Raya document collection (one 
row per root). 
? STEM_TABLE (Stem_ID, Root_ID, Stem, 
Document_Frequency, IDF) ? to store all 
distinct stems from the document collection.  
The stem frequency in the entire document 
collection and the inverse document 
frequency of each stem are calculated and 
stored (one row per stem). 
? POSTING_TABLE (Posting_ID, Stem_ID, 
Document_ID, Paragraph_ID, Position, 
Length) ? to store all the occurrences of the 
stems extracted from the entire document 
collection (one row per stem).      
? DOCUMENT_TABLE (Document_ID, 
Document_Title, Document_Date, 
Document_Path) ? to store document 
information (one row per document) 
? PARAGRAPH_TABLE (Paragraph_ID, 
Document_ID, Paragraph) ? to store all the 
paragraphs extracted from the document 
collection (one row per paragraph). This 
speeds up the analysis and the processing of 
the relevant passages that might answer to the 
user?s question.  
? QUERY_TABLE (Word, Weight) ? to store 
query information. This includes the original 
query words and the set of expanded words. 
The set of expanded words is obtained by 
extracting the available roots of the original 
query words, finding their equivalent 
Root_ID?s in the ROOT_TABLE, and then 
finding their corresponding terms stored in the 
STEM_TABLE. The weight of each word is 
calculated and stored (one row per word).

Figure 1.  System Components 
 
 
3.2.2 The NLP System 
 
The second component of the system (the NLP 
system) shown in Figure 1 was implemented by 
Abuleil [1999] to experiment in building a large 
Arabic lexicon. The NLP system is composed of a 
set of tools to tokenize and tag Arabic text, 
identify some features of the tokens and, most 
important, to identify proper names. The 
following is a description of the overall structure 
and functionality of the NLP system. 
 
 
Figure 2.  Relational Database Information 
Retrieval System 
 
 The tagger was designed to construct a 
comprehensive Arabic lexicon. The system is 
used to parse Arabic words and determine their 
parts of speech (verbs, nouns, particles).  Also it is 
used to figure out the features of each word 
(gender, number, person, tense), mark proper 
nouns in the text and determine their types 
(personal names, locations, organizations, times, 
dates, etc.). 
 The NLP system comprises the following 
modules: 
? The tokenizer, which is used to extract the 
tokens. 
? The type finder, which is used to assign a 
part-of-speech to each token. 
? The feature finder, which is used to determine 
the features of each word.   
? The proper noun phrase parser, which is used 
to mark proper nouns. 
 
The type finder module starts a lexicon lookup 
process for each token. When there is an unknown 
word in the text, the system can apply the proper 
noun phrase parser to tag the word as a proper 
noun. The recognition process occurs in multiple 
stages in which a list of patterns and heuristics 
may be applied to mark the proper noun. When 
the word is tagged as a proper noun, it is added 
automatically to the lexicon with all its possible 
 features. Being able to identify the proper names, 
among other actual entities, in the text is an 
important step in understanding and using the text.  
Unfortunately, this is not a straightforward task in 
Arabic as it is in English and most European 
languages since the uppercase/lowercase 
distinction does not exist in Arabic text. Thus, we 
have to learn more about the common patterns in 
which these entities occur in Arabic contexts.   
 
 
4 The Basic Outline of Processing 
in the IR System 
 
4.1 Document Processing 
 
This step is essential for our system. First, the 
newspaper articles from the Al-Raya newspaper 
are saved in text format using the Arabic Windows 
1256 encoding scheme. This is performed to 
extract all the html tags and to get the pure text 
contents of the articles.  Second, the IR system is 
constructed using the relational database model as 
explained above. This step involves tokenization, 
stop-word removal, root extraction, and term 
weighting. 
 
4.2 Extracting the Root 
 
In general, to extract Arabic roots from their 
words, the stemmer has to process each word in 
the following order [Khoja, 1999]:  
? Removing the Definite Article ?? ?al? 
? Removing the Conjunction Letter ?   ?w? 
? Removing Suffixes  
? Removing Prefixes  
? Pattern Matching  
 
The following example demonstrates the 
whole stemming process applied to the Arabic 
word ?????????  ?wlydrsooha?, which is mapped to 
the complete English sentence ?and they are 
going to study it?. The root of this word can be 
extracted as follows: 
 
(w)-(l)-(y)-drs-(oo)-(ha)      )??)(?(??? -)?( -(?)-(? ) 
 
1. Removing the conjunction letter (w) )?(  
? )??)(?( ???-)?( -(?) 
2. Removing the suffix (ha) )??( , which indicates 
a feminine, singular patient  
? )?(??? -)?(  -(?) 
3. Removing the suffix: (oo) )?( , which indicates 
a masculine third person plural agent  
? )??? -)?  -(?) 
4. Removing the preposition prefix (l) )?(   
 ? )??? -)?  
5. Removing the prefix: (y) )?( , which indicates 
a 3rd person, present tense ? ???   
6. The pattern ??? F9L has the same length as the 
word ??? drs. Then the stemmer detects that 
the word ??? matches the pattern  ????, since 
all the letters of the word match those in the 
pattern (i.e. ?? ?? ? ) 
7. Finally, the stemmer checks the trilateral roots 
table and concludes that the root ??? drs (he 
studied) is a valid root. 
 
 
5 Question Processing in QARAB 
 
Achieving question understanding requires deep 
semantic processing, which is a non-trivial task of 
natural language processing. In fact, Arabic NLP 
does not have solid research at the semantic level. 
Therefore, QARAB uses shallow language 
understanding to process questions and it does not 
attempt to understand the content of the question 
at a deep, semantic level. 
 QARAB treats the incoming question as a 
?bag of words? against which the index file is 
searched to obtain a list of ranked documents that 
possibly contain the answer. The question 
processing begins by performing tokenization to 
extract individual terms. Then, the stop-words are 
removed. The remaining words are tagged for 
part-of-speech in an attempt to highlight the main 
words that should appear in the hypothesized 
answer. The greatest effort should be spent on 
identifying proper names, as they are our best 
guidance to identify the possible answer. The 
interrogative particles that precede the questions 
will determine what types of answers are expected 
as shown in Table 1.  
 
 5.1  Query Expansion 
 
To achieve better search and retrieval results the 
query is expanded to include all the terms (verbs 
and nouns derived from verbs) that occur in the 
index file and have the same roots, which were 
extracted from the original query words. The 
result of the query processing is then passed to the 
IR system to retrieve a ranked list of documents 
that match the terms of the query. 
 
5.2  Query Type 
 
Questions are classified based on a set of known 
?question types?. These question types help us to 
determine the type of processing needed to 
identify and extract the final answer. The QARAB 
system recognizes the following set of question 
types (Table1):   
 
Table 1.  Question Types Processed by the 
QARAB System 
 
Query Starting with Query Type 
?? Who, Whose Person 
??? When Date, Time 
????? ??  What, Which Organization, Product,Event 
??? Where Location (natural,                 political) 
?? How Much, How Many 
Number, Quantity 
 
 There are two other types of question 
particles, namely ??? and ????? (How and Why). 
Although they will form legitimate query 
structures, they require long and procedural 
answers and are beyond the scope of our research. 
It is worth mentioning that the How and the Why 
queries also caused problems for many TREC-8 
participants.  
 
 
5.3  Query Keyword Identification 
 
The remaining words of the query (after removing 
punctuation and stop-words) are tagged for part of 
speech. This process requires using the Type-
Finder  & the Proper Name-Finder system 
implemented by Abuleil [1999]. Verbs, which 
almost always follow clear morphological 
patterns, are the easiest to identify. Nouns, 
especially proper nouns, are considered as our 
best guide to find the expected answer from the 
relevant documents returned by the IR system. 
They have to occur within the selected answer 
passage and must be in the same order as they 
appeared in the original question.   A list of 
keywords to identify personal names, 
organization names, locations, numbers, money 
and dates, has been constructed for Arabic to help 
in identifying proper names.  
 
 
6 Answer Processing in QARAB 
 
The input to the QARAB Answer Generator 
module is a natural language question and a small 
set of ranked documents. The question is first 
processed by tagging all the words. Then the set 
of relevant documents that may contain the 
answer are retrieved by the IR system. In the 
answer generation process, the passages of the 
relevant documents that match (are similar to) the 
query?s ?bag of words? closely are collected for 
further processing. The answer zones usually 
include most of the terms appearing in the original 
query in addition to the proper nouns that should 
appear in the final answer.  The following 
example illustrates the whole process taken by the 
QARAB system to answer a question. 
 
The following document extracted from the 
newspaper Al-Raya published in Qatar was 
processed by the IR system: 
 
 
 ??? ????? ????? ??????? ??????? ????? ???? ??? ??????

7  Conclusion 
 
We have described an approach to question 
answering system that provides short answers to 
questions expressed in the Arabic language. The 
system utilizes techniques from IR and NLP to 
process a collection of Arabic text documents as 
its primary source of knowledge. An actual 
system named QARAB is implemented and an 
initial ad-hoc analysis seems to be promising. The 
overall success of the system is limited to the 
amount of available tools developed for the 
Arabic language.  Work is undergoing to get
