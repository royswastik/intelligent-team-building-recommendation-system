Abstract 
Trigram language models are compressed 
using a Golomb coding method inspired by 
the original Unix spell program.  
Compression methods trade off space, time 
and accuracy (loss).  The proposed 
HashTBO method optimizes space at the 
expense of time and accuracy.  Trigram 
language models are normally considered 
memory hogs, but with HashTBO, it is 
possible to squeeze a trigram language 
model into a few megabytes or less.  
HashTBO made it possible to ship a 
trigram contextual speller in Microsoft 
Office 2007. 
1 Introduction 
This paper will describe two methods of com-
pressing trigram language models: HashTBO and 
ZipTBO. ZipTBO is a baseline compression me-
thod that is commonly used in many applications 
such as the Microsoft IME (Input Method Editor) 
systems that convert Pinyin to Chinese and Kana to 
Japanese. 
Trigram language models have been so success-
ful that they are beginning to be rolled out to appli-
cations with millions and millions of users: speech 
recognition, handwriting recognition, spelling cor-
rection, IME, machine translation and more.  The 
EMNLP community should be excited to see their 
technology having so much influence and visibility 
with so many people.  Walter Mossberg of the 
Wall Street Journal called out the contextual spel-
ler (the blue squiggles) as one of the most notable 
features in Office 2007: 
There are other nice additions. In Word, Out-
look and PowerPoint, there is now contextual spell 
checking, which points to a wrong word, even if 
the spelling is in the dictionary. For example, if 
you type ?their? instead of ?they're,? Office 
catches the mistake. It really works. 1 
The use of contextual language models in spel-
ling correction has been discussed elsewhere: 
(Church and Gale, 1991), (Mays et al 1991), (Ku-
kich, 1992) and (Golding and Schabes, 1996).  
This paper will focus on how to deploy such me-
thods to millions and millions of users.  Depending 
on the particular application and requirements, we 
need to make different tradeoffs among: 
1. Space (for compressed language model), 
2. Runtime (for n-gram lookup), and 
3. Accuracy (losses for n-gram estimates). 
HashTBO optimizes space at the expense of the 
other two.  We recommend HashTBO when space 
concerns dominate the other concerns; otherwise, 
use ZipTBO. 
 There are many applications where space is ex-
tremely tight, especially on cell phones.  HashTBO 
was developed for contextual spelling in Microsoft 
Office 2007, where space was the key challenge.  
The contextual speller probably would not have 
shipped without HashTBO compression.   
We normally think of trigram language models 
as memory hogs, but with HashTBO, a few mega-
bytes are more than enough to do interesting things 
with trigrams.  Of course, more memory is always 
better, but it is surprising how much can be done 
with so little.   
For English, the Office contextual speller started 
with a predefined vocabulary of 311k word types 
and a corpus of 6 billion word tokens.   (About a

third of the words in the vocabulary do not appear 
in the corpus.)  The vocabularies for other lan-
guages tend to be larger, and the corpora tend to be 
smaller.  Initially, the trigram language model is 
very large.  We prune out small counts (8 or less) 
to produce a starting point of 51 million trigrams, 
14 million bigrams and 311k unigrams (for Eng-
lish).  With extreme Stolcke, we cut the 51+14+0.3 
million n-grams down to a couple million.  Using a 
Golomb code, each n-gram consumes about 3 
bytes on average. 
With so much Stolcke pruning and lossy com-
pression, there will be losses in precision and re-
call.  Our evaluation finds, not surprisingly, that 
compression matters most when space is tight.  
Although HashTBO outperforms ZipTBO on the 
spelling task over a wide range of memory sizes, 
the difference in recall (at 80% precision) is most 
noticeable at the low end (under 10MBs), and least 
noticeable at the high end (over 100 MBs).  When 
there is plenty of memory (100+ MBs), the differ-
ence vanishes, as both methods asymptote to the 
upper bound (the performance of an uncompressed 
trigram language model with unlimited memory). 
2 Preliminaries 
Both methods start with a TBO (trigrams with 
backoff) LM (language model) in the standard 
ARPA format.  The ARPA format is used by many 
toolkits such as the CMU-Cambridge Statistical 
Language Modeling Toolkit.2 
2.1 Katz Backoff 
No matter how much data we have, we never 
have enough.  Nothing has zero probability.  We 
will see n-grams in the test set that did not appear 
in the training set.  To deal with this reality, Katz 
(1987) proposed backing off from trigrams to bi-
grams (and from bigrams to unigrams) when we 
don?t have enough training data.   
Backoff doesn?t have to do much for trigrams 
that were observed during training.  In that case, 
the backoff estimate of  ?(?? |???2???1)  is simply 
a discounted probability ??(??|???2???1). 
The discounted probabilities steal from the rich 
and give to the poor.  They take some probability 
mass from the rich n-grams that have been seen in 
training and give it to poor unseen n-grams that

might appear in test.  There are many ways to dis-
count probabilities.  Katz used Good-Turing 
smoothing, but other smoothing methods such as 
Kneser-Ney are more popular today. 
Backoff is more interesting for unseen trigrams.  
In that case, the backoff estimate is: 
? ???2???1 ??(??|???1) 
The backoff alphas (?) are a normalization fac-
tor that accounts for the discounted mass.  That is, 
 
? ???2???1 
=
1?  ?(??|???2???1)? ? :?(? ??2? ??1? ?)
1?  ?(??|???1)? ? :?(? ??2? ??1? ?)
 
 
where ? ???2???1?? > 0  simply says that the 
trigram was seen in training data. 
3 Stolcke Pruning 
Both ZipTBO and HashTBO start with Stolcke 
pruning (1998).3   We will refer to the trigram lan-
guage model after backoff and pruning as a pruned 
TBO LM. 
Stolcke pruning looks for n-grams that would 
receive nearly the same estimates via Katz backoff 
if they were removed.  In a practical system, there 
will never be enough memory to explicitly mate-
rialize all n-grams that we encounter during train-
ing.  In this work, we need to compress a large set 
of n-grams (that appear in a large corpus of 6 bil-
lion words) down to a relatively small language 
model of just a couple of megabytes. We prune as 
much as necessary to make the model fit into the 
memory allocation (after subsequent Hash-
TBO/ZipTBO compression).   
Pruning saves space by removing n-grams sub-
ject to a loss consideration: 
1. Select a threshold ?. 
2. Compute the performance loss due to prun-
ing each trigram and bigram individually us-
ing the pruning criterion. 
3. Remove all trigrams with performance loss 
less than ? 
4. Remove all bigrams with no child nodes (tri-
gram nodes) and with performance loss less 
than ?   
5. Re-compute backoff weights.

Stolcke pruning uses a loss function based on 
relative entropy.  Formally, let P denote the tri-
gram probabilities assigned by the original un-
pruned model, and let P? denote the probabilities in 
the pruned model.  Then the relative entropy 
D(P||P?) between the two models is 
 
? ? ?,? [log?? ? ? ? log?(?,?)]
? ,?
 
 
where h is the history.  For trigrams, the history is 
the previous two words.  Stolcke showed that this 
reduces to 
?? ? {?(?|?) 
[log? ? ?? + log?? ? ? log?(?|?)] 
+[log??(?) ? log?(?)]  ? ? ? 
? :? ? ,? >0
} 
 
where ??(?)  is the revised backoff weight after 
pruning and h? is the revised history after dropping 
the first word.  The summation is over all the tri-
grams that were seen in training: ? ?,? > 0.  
Stolcke pruning will remove n-grams as neces-
sary, minimizing this loss. 
3.1 Compression on Top of Pruning 
After Stolcke pruning, we apply additional com-
pression (either ZipTBO or HashTBO).  ZipTBO 
uses a fairly straightforward data structure, which 
introduces relatively few additional losses on top 
of the pruned TBO model.  A few small losses are 
introduced by quantizing the log likelihoods and 
the backoff alphas, but those losses probably don?t 
matter much.  More serious losses are introduced 
by restricting the vocabulary size, V, to the 64k 
most-frequent words.  It is convenient to use byte 
aligned pointers.   The actual vocabulary of more 
than 300,000 words for English (and more for oth-
er languages) would require 19-bit pointers (or 
more) without pruning.   Byte operations are faster 
than bit operations.  There are other implementa-
tions of ZipTBO that make different tradeoffs, and 
allow for larger V without pruning losses. 
HashTBO is more heroic.  It uses a method in-
spired by McIlroy (1982) in the original Unix Spell 
Program, which squeezed a word list of N=32,000 
words into a PDP-11 address space (64k bytes).  
That was just 2 bytes per word!   
HashTBO uses similar methods to compress a 
couple million n-grams into half a dozen mega-
bytes, or about 3 bytes per n-gram on average (in-
cluding log likelihoods and alphas for backing off).  
ZipTBO is faster, but takes more space (about 4 
bytes per n-gram on average, as opposed to 3 bytes 
per n-gram).  Given a fixed memory budget, 
ZipTBO has to make up the difference with more 
aggressive Stolcke pruning.  More pruning leads to 
larger losses, as we will see, for the spelling appli-
cation.   
Losses will be reported in terms of performance 
on the spelling task.  It would be nice if losses 
could be reported in terms of cross entropy, but the 
values output by the compressed language models 
cannot be interpreted as probabilities due to quan-
tization losses and other compression losses. 
4 McIlroy?s Spell Program 
McIlroy?s spell program started with a hash ta-
ble.  Normally, we store the clear text in the hash 
table, but he didn?t have space for that, so he 
didn?t.   Hash collisions introduce losses. 
McIlroy then sorted the hash codes and stored 
just the interarrivals of the hash codes instead of 
the hash codes themselves.  If the hash codes, h, 
are distributed by a Poisson process, then the inte-
rarrivals, t, are exponentially distributed: 
 
Pr ? = ????? ,  
 
where ? =
?
?
.  Recall that the dictionary contains 
N=32,000 words.  P is the one free parameter, the 
range of the hash function.   McIlroy hashed words 
into a large integer mod P, where P is a large 
prime that trades off space and accuracy.  Increas-
ing P consumes more space, but also reduces 
losses (hash collisions). 
McIlroy used a Golomb (1966) code to store the 
interarrivals.  A Golomb code is an optimal Huff-
man code for an infinite alphabet of symbols with 
exponential probabilities. 
The space requirement (in bits per lexical entry) 
is close to the entropy of the exponential. 
 
? = ?  Pr ? log2 Pr ? ??
?
?=0
 
? =  
1
log? 2
+  log2
1
?
   
 
201
 The ceiling operator ? ?  is introduced because 
Huffman codes use an integer number of bits to 
encode each symbol. 
We could get rid of the ceiling operation if we 
replaced the Huffman code with an Arithmetic 
code, but it is probably not worth the effort. 
Lookup time is relatively slow.  Technically, 
lookup time is O(N), because one has to start at the 
beginning and add up the interarrivals to recon-
struct the hash codes.  McIlroy actually introduced 
a small table on the side with hash codes and off-
sets so one could seek to these offsets and avoid 
starting at the beginning every time.  Even so, our 
experiments will show that HashTBO is an order 
of magnitude slower than ZipTBO. 
Accuracy is also an issue.  Fortunately, we don?t 
have a problem with dropouts.  If a word is in the 
dictionary, we aren?t going to misplace it.  But two 
words in the dictionary could hash to the same val-
ue.  In addition, a word that is not in the dictionary 
could hash to the same value as a word that is in 
the dictionary.  For McIlroy?s application (detect-
ing spelling errors), the only concern is the last 
possibility.  McIlroy did what he could do to miti-
gate false positive errors by increasing P as much 
as he could, subject to the memory constraint (the 
PDP-11 address space of 64k bytes). 
We recommend these heroics when space domi-
nates other concerns (time and accuracy). 
5 Golomb Coding 
Golomb coding takes advantage of the sparseness 
in the interarrivals between hash codes.  Let?s start 
with a simple recipe.  Let t be an interarrival.   We 
will decompose t into a pair of a quotient (tq) and a 
remainder (tr).  That is, let ? = ??? + ??  where 
?? = ??/ ??  and ?? = ? mod ?.  We choose m to 
be a power of two near ? ?  
? ? 
2
 =  
?
2?
 , where 
E[t] is the expected value of the interarrivals, de-
fined below.  Store tq in unary and tr in binary. 
Binary codes are standard, but unary is not.  To 
encode a number z in unary, simply write out a 
sequence of z-1 zeros followed by a 1.  Thus, it 
takes z bits to encode the number z in unary, as 
opposed to  log2 ? bits in binary. 
This recipe consumes ?? + log2?  bits.  The 
first term is for the unary piece and the second 
term is for the binary piece. 
Why does this recipe make sense?  As men-
tioned above, a Golomb code is a Huffman code 
for an infinite alphabet with exponential probabili-
ties.  We illustrate Huffman codes for infinite al-
phabets by starting with a simple example of a 
small (very finite) alphabet with just three sym-
bols: {a, b, c}. Assume that half of the time, we 
see a, and the rest of the time we see b or c, with 
equal probabilities: 
 
Symbol Code Length Pr 
A 0 1 50% 
B 10 2 25% 
C 11 2 25% 
 
The Huffman code in the table above can be read 
off the binary tree below.   We write out a 0 when-
ever we take a left branch and a 1 whenever we 
take a right branch.  The Huffman tree is con-
structed so that the two branches are equally likely 
(or at least as close as possible to equally likely). 
 
 
 
 
Now, let?s consider an infinite alphabet where 
Pr ? =
1
2
 , Pr ? =
1
4
  and the probability of the 
t+1st symbol is Pr ? = (1? ?)??  where ? =
1
2
.  
In this case, we have the following code, which is 
simply t in unary.  That is, we write out 1?t  zeros 
followed by a 1. 
 
Symbol Code Length Pr 
A 1 1 2?1 
B 01 2 2?2 
C 001 3 2?3 
 
202
The Huffman code reduces to unary when the 
Huffman tree is left branching: 
 
 
 
In general, ? need not be ?.  Without loss of ge-
nerality, assume Pr ? =  1 ? ? ??  where 
1
2
? ? < 1 and ? ? 0.  ? depends on E[t], the ex-
pected value of the interarrivals: 
 
? ? =
?
?
=
?
1? ?
? ? =
? ? 
1 + ? ? 
 
 
Recall that the recipe above calls for expressing 
t as ? ? ?? + ??  where ?? = ?
?
?
?  and ?? =
? mod ?.  We encode tq in unary and tr
 in binary.  
(The binary piece consumes log2?  bits, since tr 
ranges from 0 to m.) 
How do we pick m?   For convenience, let m be 
a power of 2.   The unary encoding makes sense as 
a Huffman code if ?? ?
1
2
.   
Thus, a reasonable choice 4  is ? ?  
? ? 
2
 .   If 
? =
? ? 
1+? ? 
, then ?? =
? ? ?
 1+? ?  ?
? 1?
?
? ? 
.  Set-
ting ?? ?
1
2
, means ? ?
? ? 
2
.

6  HashTBO Format 
The HashTBO format is basically the same as McI-
lroy?s format, except that McIlroy was storing 
words and we are storing n-grams.    One could 
store all of the n-grams in a single table, though we 
actually store unigrams in a separate table.  An n-
gram is represented as a key of n integers (offsets 
into the vocabulary) and two values, a log likelih-
ood and, if appropriate, an alpha for backing off.    
We?ll address the keys first. 
6.1 HashTBO Keys 
Trigrams consist of three integers (offsets into 
the Vocabulary): ?1?2?3. These three integers are 
mapped into a single hash between 0 and ? ? 1 in 
the obvious way: 
 
???? =  ?3?
0 +?2?
1 +?1?
2  mod ?  
 
where V is vocabulary size.  Bigrams are hashed 
the same way, except that the vocabulary is padded 
with an extra symbol for NA (not applicable).  In 
the bigram case, ?3 is NA. 
We then follow a simple recipe for bigrams and 
trigrams: 
1. Stolcke prune appropriately 
2. Let N be the number of n-grams 
3. Choose an appropriate P (hash range) 
4. Hash the N n-grams 
5. Sort the hash codes 
6. Take the first differences (which are mod-
eled as interarrivals of a Poisson process) 
7. Golomb code the first differences  
 
We did not use this method for unigrams, since 
we assumed (perhaps incorrectly) that we will have 
explicit likelihoods for most of them and therefore 
there is little opportunity to take advantage of 
sparseness. 
Most of the recipe can be fully automated with a 
turnkey process, but two steps require appropriate 
hand intervention to meet the memory allocation 
for a particular application: 
1. Stolcke prune appropriately, and 
2. Choose an appropriate P  
 
                                                                             
1999) and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golomb_coding, 
for similar discussion, though with slightly different 
notation.  The primary reference is (Golomb, 1966). 
203
Ideally, we?d like to do as little pruning as poss-
ible and we?d like to use as large a P as possible, 
subject to the memory allocation.  We don?t have a 
principled argument for how to balance Stolcke 
pruning losses with hashing losses; this can be ar-
rived at empirically on an application-specific ba-
sis.  For example, to fix the storage per n-gram at 
around 13 bits: 
13 =  
1
log? 2
+ log2
1
?
  
 
If we solve for ?, we obtain 0000,20/1?? .  In 
other words, set P to a prime near N000,20 and 
then do as much Stolcke pruning as necessary to 
meet the memory constraint.   Then measure your 
application?s accuracy, and adjust accordingly. 
6.2 HashTBO Values and Alphas 
There are N log likelihood values, one for each 
key.  These N values are quantized into a small 
number of distinct bins.  They are written out as a 
sequence of N Huffman codes.  If there are Katz 
backoff alphas, then they are also written out as a 
sequence of N Huffman codes.  (Unigrams and 
bigrams have alphas, but trigrams don?t.) 
6.3 HashTBO Lookup 
The lookup process is given an n-gram, 
???2???1?? , and is asked to estimate a log likelih-
ood, log Pr ??  ???2???1) .  Using the standard 
backoff model, this depends on the likelihoods for 
the unigrams, bigrams and trigrams, as well as the 
alphas. 
The lookup routine not only determines if the n-
gram is in the table, but also determines the offset 
within that table.  Using that offset, we can find the 
appropriate log likelihood and alpha.  Side tables 
are maintained to speed up random access. 
7 ZipTBO Format 
ZipTBO is a well-established representation of 
trigrams.  Detailed descriptions can be found in 
(Clarkson and Rosenfeld 1997; Whittaker and Raj 
2001). 
ZipTBO consumes 8 bytes per unigram, 5 bytes 
per bigram and 2.5 bytes per trigram.  In practice, 
this comes to about 4 bytes per n-gram on average. 
Note that there are some important interactions 
between ZipTBO and Stolcke pruning.  ZipTBO is 
relatively efficient for trigrams, compared to bi-
grams.   Unfortunately, aggressive Stolcke pruning 
generates bigram-heavy models, which don?t com-
press well with ZipTBO.

format, following Whittaker and Ray (2001) 
 
7.1 ZipTBO Keys 
The tree structure of the trigram model is im-
plemented using three arrays. As shown in Figure 
1, from left to right, the first array (called unigram 
array) stores unigram nodes, each of which 
branches out into bigram nodes in the second array 
(bigram array).  Each bigram node then branches 
out into trigram nodes in the third array (trigram 
array).  
The length of the unigram array is determined 
by the vocabulary size (V).  The lengths of the oth-
er two arrays depend on the number of bigrams 
and the number of trigrams, which depends on how 
aggressively they were pruned.  (We do not prune 
unigrams.) 
We store a 2-byte word id for each unigram, bi-
gram and trigram. 
The unigram nodes point to blocks of bigram 
nodes, and the bigram nodes point to blocks of tri-
gram nodes.  There are boundary symbols between 
blocks (denoted by the pointers in Figure 1).   The 
boundary symbols consume 4 bytes for each uni-
gram and 2 bytes for each bigram. 
In each block, nodes are sorted by their word 
ids. Blocks are consecutive, so the boundary value 
204
of an n?1-gram node together with the boundary 
value of its previous n?1-gram node specifies, in 
the n-gram array, the location of the block contain-
ing all its child nodes. To locate a particular child 
node, a binary search of word ids is performed 
within the block. 
 
Figure 3.  The differences between the methods in 
Figure 2 vanish if we adjust for prune size. 
7.2 ZipTBO Values and Alphas 
Like HashTBO, the log likelihood values and 
backoff alphas are quantized to a small number of 
quantization levels (256 levels for unigrams and 16 
levels for bigrams and trigrams).   Unigrams use a 
full byte for the log likelihoods, plus another full 
byte for the alphas.  Bigrams use a half byte for the 
log likelihood, plus another half byte for the al-
phas.  Trigrams use a half byte for the log likelih-
ood.  (There are no alphas for trigrams.) 
7.3 ZipTBO Bottom Line 
1. 8 bytes for each unigram:  
a. 2 bytes for a word id + 
b. 4 bytes for two boundary symbols +  
c. 1 byte for a log likelihood +  
d. 1 byte for an alpha 
2. 5 bytes for each bigram:  
a. 2 bytes for a word id +  
b. 2 bytes for a boundary symbol +  
c. ? bytes for a log likelihood + 
d. ? bytes for an alpha 
3. 2.5 bytes for each trigram: 
a. 2 bytes for a word id + 
b. ? bytes for a log likelihood 
8 Evaluation 
We normally think of trigram language models 
as memory hogs, but Figure 2 shows that trigrams 
can be squeezed down to a megabyte in a pinch.  
Of course, more memory is always better, but it is 
surprising how much can be done (27% recall at 
80% precision) with so little memory. 
Given a fixed memory budget, HashTBO out-
performs ZipTBO which outperforms StdTBO, a 
baseline system with no compression.  Compres-
sion matters more when memory is tight.  The gap 
between methods is more noticeable at the low end 
(under 10 megabytes) and less noticeable at the 
high end (over 100 megabytes), where both me-
thods asymptote to the performance of the StdTBO 
baseline. 
All methods start with Stolcke pruning.   Figure 
3 shows that the losses are largely due to pruning.

HashTBO ZipTBO
205
All three methods perform about equally well, as-
suming the same amount of pruning.   
The difference is that HashTBO can store more 
n-grams in the same memory and therefore it 
doesn?t have to do as much pruning.  Figure 4 
shows that HashTBO consumes 3 bytes per n-gram 
whereas ZipTBO consumes 4. 
Figure 4 combines unigrams, bigrams and tri-
grams into a single n-gram variable.  Figure 5 drills 
down into this variable, distinguishing bigrams 
from trigrams.  The axes here have been reversed 
so we can see that HashTBO can store more of 
both kinds in less space.  Note that both HashTBO 
lines are above both ZipTBO lines.   
 
Figure 5. HashTBO stores more bigrams and tri-
grams than ZipTBO in less space. 
 
In addition, note that both bigram lines are 
above both trigram lines (triangles).  Aggressively 
pruned models have more bigrams than trigrams!   
Linear regression on this data shows that Hash-
TBO is no better than ZipTBO on trigrams (with 
the particular settings that we used), but there is a 
big difference on bigrams.  The regressions below 
model M (memory in bytes) as a function of bi and 
tri, the number of bigrams and trigrams, respec-
tively.  (Unigrams are modeled as part of the inter-
cept since all models have the same number of un-
igrams.) 
 
???????? = 0.8 + 3.4?? + 2.6??? 
??????? = 2.6 + 4.9?? + 2.6??? 
 
As a sanity check, it is reassuring that ZipTBO?s 
coefficients of 4.9 and 2.6 are close to the true val-
ues of 5 bytes per bigram and 2.5 bytes per tri-
gram, as reported in Section 7.3. 
According to the regression, HashTBO is no 
better than ZipTBO for trigrams.  Both models use 
roughly 2.6 bytes per trigram.  When trigram mod-
els have relatively few trigrams, the other coeffi-
cients matter.  HashTBO uses less space for bi-
grams (3.4 bytes/bigram << 4.9 bytes/bigram) and 
it has a better intercept (0.8 << 2.6). 
We recommend HashTBO if space is so tight 
that it dominates other concerns.  However, if there 
is plenty of space, or time is an issue, then the tra-
deoffs work out differently.   Figure 6 shows that 
ZipTBO is an order of magnitude faster than 
HashTBO.  The times are reported in microseconds 
per n-gram lookup on a dual Xeon PC with a 3.6 
ghz clock and plenty of RAM (4GB).  These times 
were averaged over a test set of 4 million lookups.  
The test process uses a cache.  Turning off the 
cache increases the difference in lookup times. 
 
Figure 6. HashTBO is slower than ZipTBO. 
9 Conclusion 
Trigram language models were compressed 
using HashTBO, a Golomb coding method 
inspired by McIlroy?s original spell program for 
Unix.  McIlroy used the method to compress a 
dictionary of 32,000 words into a PDP-11 address 
space of 64k bytes.  That is just 2 bytes per word! 
We started with a large corpus of 6 billion words 
of English.  With HashTBO, we could compress 
the trigram language model into just a couple of 
megabytes using about 3 bytes per n-gram 
(compared to 4 bytes per n-gram for the ZipTBO 
baseline).  The proposed HashTBO method is not 
fast, and it is not accurate (not lossless), but it is 
hard to beat if space is tight, which was the case 
for the contextual speller in Microsoft Office 2007.
