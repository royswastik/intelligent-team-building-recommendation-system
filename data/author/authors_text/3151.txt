Abstract 
This report introduces the activities of the 
two organizations related to collection 
and distribution of text and speech cor-
pora in Japan. One is the Language Re-
source Association (GSK) and the other 
is NII-Speech Resources Consortium 
(NII-SRC).  
1 Introduction 
Although the need for shared speech and text 
data has long been acknowledged, its realization 
has been slow to develop in Japan. The Language 
Resource Association (GSK) was established in 
1999 in order to share and distribute text and 
speech corpora. It was renovated as an NPO in 
2003 with an emphasis on text corpora. The Na-
tional Institute of Informatics (NII) has decided 
to initiate the Speech Resources Consortium 
(SRC) in 2006, with the goal of creating future 
value in information media, particularly speech 
media.  
2 NII-Speech Resources Consortium 
The National Institute of Informatics (NII) was 
founded in Tokyo, Japan in April 2000 as an in-
ter-university research institute organized to con-
duct comprehensive research on informatics and 
to develop an advanced infrastructure for dis-
seminating scientific information. As a part of 
promoting the missions, NII decided in 2006 to 
initiate the Speech Resources Consortium (SRC) 
for creating future value in information media, 
particularly speech media. NII is promoting this 
consortium together with GSK (Itahashi and Oh-
suga, 2006). 
2.1  SRC objective and activities 
The SRC aims at the collection, distribution, in-
vestigation, research, and standardization of elec-
tronic data and software tools that are necessary 
for the development of science, education, and 
industry concerning speech. The consortium will 
contribute to the development of the information 
society through these activities.  
The SRC investigates the existing speech re-
sources, catalogues them, and shows them on its 
homepage in order to promote the research and 
development of speech information processing. It 
also requests research institutions to offer their 
speech resources to the SRC. Based on these ac-
tivities, it urges the distribution, promotion, and 
publicity of speech resources. The consortium 
will conduct the additional production and distri-
bution of the speech resources that are frequently 
requested. It also conducts investigations and re-
search on speech resources. Users will be able to 
obtain the speech resources or data they need and 
use them through simple processes offered by the 
SRC.  SRC distributes 23 speech corpora.  
2.2 Organization 
The SRC is made up of a chairperson, a re-
searcher, an adviser, a secretary, and a Speech 
Corpora Promotion Committee. The committee 
works to promote the development of the SRC. 
Around 15 members have been invited to join the 
committee from the fields of speech processing,

linguistics, acoustics, speech and language corpus 
creation, and speech and language resource pro-
vision. The committee meets a few times a year. 
3 Language Resource Association (GSK) 
The GSK was renovated as an NPO in 2003 and 
is qualified as a corporate body and can mediate 
between the producer and users of a language 
corpora (Hasida and Tanaka, 2006).  
3.1 GSK objective and activities 
The GSK aims at almost the same objectives as 
those of the NII-SRC mentioned in the preceding 
section, including both the text and speech 
corpora, but the text corpora are the main concern 
of GSK at present.  
Prof. Y. Mikami of Nagaoka University of 
Technology proposed a project on the ?Construc-
tion of Networks for Asian Linguistic Informa-
tion Technology Resources? together with GSK. 
This proposal was adopted as a three-year project 
starting from fiscal 2005. It is supported by the 
Science and Technology Promotion & Coordina-
tion Fund, and Yen15 million ($125,000) is 
available for GSK. The mission of the project is 
to create a network of qualified Asian partners to 
specify and support the development of high pri-
ority language resources for Asian languages. As 
a part of this project, the GSK organized the 
?Asian Language Resources Workshop 2007? in 
March.  Twenty one people from 13 countries 
participated in the workshop.  
The GSK activities are almost the same as 
those of the NII-SRC. The GSK is made up of a 
president, two vice presidents, 11 board members, 
25 steering committee members, a secretary, and 
two office clerks. GSK supplies two text corpora 
and a speech corpus; it plans to distribute seven 
more text corpora soon.  
3.2 Corpora distribution system 
We have three systems of corpora distribution to 
be conducted by the NII-SRC and GSK. (1) No-
fee distribution: As a rule, the cost of handling 
the corpora is to fall on the user, although the cor-
pus itself is free of charge. (2) Agency: The pro-
ducers of the corpora entrust the SRC/GSK with 
receiving requests from the users. The SRC/GSK 
advertises the corpora to speech researchers 
through the homepage. It mediates the user?s re-
quests to the producer or provider of the corpora. 
(3) Fee-based distribution: Making speech cor-
pora usually requires some money, including roy-
alties. Some corpora cost users a certain amount 
of money to obtain, although they are not so ex-
pensive.  
4 Present Issues 
So far, we have established the GSK and NII-
SRC for the text and speech corpora, respectively, 
while the LDC and ELRA distributes both the 
speech and text corpora.  
The GSK is supported by a project until the 
end of this fiscal year, but it will loose its finan-
cial support at that point. The GSK has a rela-
tively small amount of corpora to be distributed, 
so it is still too early to stand on its own feet. The 
NII-SRC activities will be supported by a project 
for a few more years, but it can not gain profit 
from distributing the corpora created by the re-
searchers outside of NII. We will search for better 
ways by which both the NII-SRC and GSK will 
be able to act as corpora agents like the LDC or 
ELRA. There are some more organizations re-
lated to language resources such as ATR, NICT, 
and NIJL. We need much more collaboration and 
coordination among these. 
5 Conclusion 
This report explained the activities of the GSK 
and the NII?Speech Resources Consortium (NII-
SRC).  GSK and NII-SRC will facilitate the dis-
tribution, promotion, and publicity of the lan-
guage resources, and in so doing, will contribute 
to the information society in Japan and in Asia.

Abst ract  
Summarization of multiple documents featur- 
ing multiple topics is discussed. The exam- 
ple trea.ted here consists of fifty articles about 
the Peru hostage incident tbr \])ecember 1996 
through April 1997. They include a. lot of top- 
ics such as opening, negotiation, ending, and 
so on. The method proposed in this paper is 
based on spreading activation over documents 
syntactically and semantically annotated with 
GI)A (Global l)ocument Annotation) tags. The 
method extracts important documents aald im- 
portant parts therein, and creates a network 
consisting of important entities and relations 
among them. It also identifies cross-document 
coreferences to replace expressions with more 
concrete ones. The method is essentially multi~ 
lingua\] due to the language-independence of the 
GDA tagset. This tagset can provide a stan- 
dard fornm.t br the study on the transfbrmation 
and/or generation stage of summarization pro- 
cess, among other natural language processing 
tasks. 
1 I n t roduct ion  
A large ('.vent consists of a, number of smaller 
events. These component events are usually 
related trot such relations may not be strong 
enough to define larger topics. For example, a 
war may consist of opening, battles, negotia- 
tions, and so on. These relatively independent 
events are considered to be topics by themselves 
and would accordingly be reported in multiple 
news re'titles. 
Summarization of such a large event, or mul- 
tiple documents about multiple topics, is the 
concern of this paper. Summarization of multi- 
ple documents containing nmltiple topics is an 
unexplored research issue. Some previous tud- 
ies on summarization (McKeown and Radev, 
1995; Barzilay et al, 1999; Mani and Bloedorn, 
1999) deal with multiple docmnents about a sin- 
gle topic, but not about multiple topics 1. 
In order to smnmarize lnultiple docmne, nts 
with multiple topics, one needs a general, 
semantics-oriented method for evaluating im- 
portance. Summarization of a single document 
may largely exploit the doculnent structure. As 
an extreme example, the first paragraph of a 
newspaper article often serves as a smmnary of 
the entire article. On the other hand, summa.- 
rization of multiple, documents in general must 
be more based on their semantic structures, be- 
cause the, re is no overall consistent document 
structure across them. 
Selection of multiple important topics (not 
keywords) tbr nmltiple-topic summarization has 
not; yet been really addressed in the previ- 
ous literatm:e. The present paper proposes a 
method, based on spreading a.ctivation, for ex- 
tracting important opics and important docu- 
ments. Another method proposed which is use- 
fifl for grasping the overview of nlultiple docu- 
ments is visualization of important entities men- 
tioned and relationships among them. Visu- 
alization of relationships among keywords has 
been studied in the context of information re- 
trieval (Niwa et al, 1997; Sanderson and Croft, 
\] 999), but to the authors' knowledge the present 
study is the first to address uch visualization in 
the context of summm'ization. Of conrse a. con- 
cise summary of the entire set of multiple docu- 
lnents can be obtained by recovering sentences 
from important entities and their relationships 
~s demonstrated in section 3.3. 
The present study assumes documents anno- 
tated with GDA (Global Document Annota-

tion) Lags (Itasida, 1997; Nagao and llasida, 
1!)98). Since the GI)A tagset is designed to be 
inclel)endent of any particular natural language, 
the proposed method is essent, ially multilingual. 
Another merit of using annotate, d documents is 
that we ca.n separate the a,nalysis phase from 
the whole process of summarization so that we 
ca,n locus on the latter, generation t)hase of sum- 
ma.rization process. Annotated documents can 
also be useflfl for a common input format for 
the study of summarization, among other nat- 
ural language processing tasks. 
2 The  GDA Tagset  
GI)A is a project to make on-line documents 
ntachinc-ullderstanda.ble on the basis of a lin- 
guistic ta.gset, while developing and si)read- 
ing technologies of content-based presentation, 
retrieval, question-answering, smnma.rization, 
translation, among othe, rs, with much higher 
quality than before. GI)A thus proposes an 
integrated global plattbrm for e,h',ctronic on- 
tent authoring, t)resental;ion, a,nd reuse. The 
GI)A tagset 2 is an XM1, (eXtensible Markup 
l,anguage) insta,nce which allows ma.chines to 
automatically infex the semantic and pra.gma.tic 
structures uncle, flying the raw (locuments. 
Under the current sta.te of the art, GI)A- 
tagging is senfiautomatic and calls for manual 
correction by human mmotators; othe, rwise an- 
notation would ma,ke no sense. "l~h( ,, cost in- 
volved here pays, because annota,ted ocuments 
are generic information contents from which to 
rend(',r diverse types of 1)resenta.tions, poi;en- 
tially involving summariza.tion, arra,tion, visu- 
alization, translation, information retriewfl, in- 
formation extra.ction, and so forth. The present 
p~,per concerns summarization only, trot the 
merit of GI)A-tagging is not a,t all restricted to 
smmnarization, and that is why it is considered 
reasonable to assume Gl)A-tagged input here. 
2.1. Syntact ic structure 
An example of a. Ol)A-tagged sentence is shown 
in Figure 1. <su> means sentential unit. <np>, 
<v>, and <adp> stand for noun t)hrase, verb, 
and adnominal or adverbial phrase. 
<su> and the tags whose name end with 'p' 
(such as <adp> and <vp>) a,re called phrnsal 
ta.qs. In a sentence, an (;lement (a text Sl)an 
2http ://www. etl. go. j p/etl/nl/gDk/tagset, html 
<su> 
<np>Time</np> 
<v>f l ies</v> 
<adp> 
l ike 
<np>an ar row</np> 
</adp> 
</su> 
Figure 1: A Gl)A-tagged sentence. 
from a begin tag to the corresponding end tag) 
is usually a syntactic onstituent. The elements 
enclosed in phrasal tags are called ph,~asal ele- 
ments, which cannot be the head of larger ele- 
ments. So in Figure 1. 'flies' is specified to be 
the hea.d of the <su> element and qike' the head 
of the <adp> element. 
2.2 Coreferences and Anaphora 
Each element ma.y have an identifier as the va.lue 
for l;he id attrit)ute,. Corefe, rences, including 
identity ana.t)hora , are annotated by the eq at- 
tribute, as follows: 
<np id="j0">John</np> beats 
<adp eq="j0">his</adp> dog. 
When the shared sc, nm.ntic content is not the 
rctb, renl; lint the typ(', (kind, se, t, etc.) of the 
retb, rents, the eq.ab attribute is used like the 
following: 
You bought a <np id="cl">car</np>. 
3 bought <np eq. ab="cl">one</np>, 
too .  
A zero anaphora is encoded as follows: 
Tom visited <np id="ml">Mary</np>. 
He had <v iob="ml">brought</v> a 
present. 
iob="ml" means that the indirect object of 
brough, t is elemenl~ whose id value is ml, that 
is, Mary. 
Other relations, such as sub and sup, can also 
be encoded, sub represents subset, t)art, or ele- 
ment. An example follows: 
She has <np id="bl">many 
books</np>. 
<namep sub =''b i "> c c AI i ce ~ s 
893 
Adventures in Wonderland' '</namep> 
is her favorite. 
sup is the inverse of sub, i.e., ineluder of any 
sort, which is superset a.s to subset, whole as to 
part, or set as to element. 
Syntactic structures and corefc, rences are es- 
sential for the summarization method described 
in section 3. l?urther details such as semantics, 
coordination, scoping, illocutionary act, and so 
on, are omitted here. 
3 Mu l t i -Document  Summar izat ion  
3.1 Spreading activation 
A set of GDA-tagged documents is regarded as 
a network in which nodes roughly correspond to 
GI)A elements and links represent he syntac- 
tic and semantic relations among them. This 
network is the tree of GI)A elements plus cross- 
reference (via eq, eq.ab,  sub, sup, and so on) 
links among them. Cross-reference \]inks nlay 
encompass different documents. Figure 2 shows 
a schematic, graphical representation f the net- 
work.

Figure 2: Multi-document network. 
Spreading activation is carried out in this 
network to assess the importance of the ele- 
ments. Spreading activation has been applied 
to summarization of single GDA-tagged docu- 
ments (Hasida et al, 1987; Naga.o and Hasida, 
1998). The main conjecture of the present study 
is that the merit of spreading activation in that 
it evaluates importances of semantic entities 
is greater in summarization of multiple docu- 
ments with multiple topics, because smnmariza- 
tion techniques using docnment structures do 
not; apply here, as mentioned em:lier. 
To fit the semantic interpretation, activations 
spread under the condition that coreferent ele- 
ments should have the same activation vahm. 
The algorithm a is shown in Figure 3. Iiere the 
external input c(i) to node i represents a pri- 
ori importance of i, which is set on an empir- 
ical basis; for instance, an entity 4 referred to 
in the title of an article tend to be hnportant, 
and thus c(i) should be relatively large for the 
corresponding node i. Tile weight w(i, j) of an- 
other kind of link Dora node i to node j may 
also be set empMcally, but it is fixed to a uni- 
tbrm value in tile present work. Let E(i) be tile 
equivalence class of node i, that is the set of 
nodes which are coreferent with i (linked with i 
via eq relationships). Condition 
E E\] ,,,(k,0)_< 1
~eU(i) .iCE(i) 
should be satisfied in order for the spreading ac- 
t ivat ion to converge. This  condit ion is satisfied 
if we treat each equivalence class of nodes as a 
virtual node while setting the weights of other 
types of links to be 1/5, where D is the maximum 
degree of equivalence classes: 
O=max ~ ~ @'i 
i ~eE(,i) .iCE(.i) 
where 5&~ is \] if there is a link between ode k 
and node j ,  otherwise it is 0. 
The score score(i) of node i is calculated by 
summing the activation wdues of all the nodes 
m~dcr node i in the syntactic tree strueture: 
.~.'o,'~'.(i) =a( i )+  ~ .~co,'4j ) (l) 
jCch(i) 
where a(i) is the activation vahle of node i and 
oh(i) is the set of child nodes of node i. oh(i) is 
empty if node i is a leaf node, or a word. This 
score is regarded as the importance of node i. 
3.2 Extraction of important documents 
and sentences 
Extraction of i lnportant documents is simple 
once the scores of the nodes in the network are 
obtained. Sorting the document nodes accord- 
ing to their scores and extracting higher-rm~ked 
ones is sufticient for the purpose. 
aAnother spreading activation algorithm is discussed 
by Mani aim Bloedorn (1999). The comparison is a fu- 
ture work.

An experiment ha,s been conducted to test the 
effeetiwmess of the proposed aJgorithm. The ex- 
a.mple set contains fifty Japanese articles about 
the Peru hostage incident which continued over 
four months fl'om I)ecember 1996 to April \] 997. 
They include a lot of topics such a.s opening, 
negotiation, settlement, mid so on. The GI)A- 
tagging of these articles has involved automatic 
morphological na.lysis by JUMAN (Kurohashi 
mid Na.ga.o, 1998), automatic syntactic ana.lysis 
by KNP (Kurohashi, 1998), and ma.nual anno- 
tation encompassing morphology, syntax, coref- 
erence, and anaphora.. The types of a.naphora, 
identified here are ma.inly pla.in coreference and 
zero ana.phora. Cross-document coreferenees 
among entities ha.ve been a.utomatieaJly identi- 
fled by exa,et string mt~tching. 5 They oonta,ined 
erl'OlTS but those el'l;ors %7e17o llOt corl'eCl;(',d for 
the experiment. Cross-document coreferenees 
found were 'l'eru'(49), 'Japa.n'(39), 'Peru Pres- 
ident' (15), 'members of Tupac Amaru'(9), ... 
and so on, where the mmfi~ors indicate the num- 
bers of documents which contain these expres- 
sions. 
The externa.1 inputs to nodes have been de- 
fined a.ccording to the corresponding nodes: 
c(i) = 10 if node i's antecedent domina.tes sen- 
fences (e.g., a. node eoreferring with a. pa.ra.- 
graph). This sets a, preference for nodes which 
summa.rize preceding sentences, c(i) = 5 if node 
i is in the title of an article, beemlse a. title is 
usually importa.nt. Otherwise c(i) = 1. These 
crude t)a,raJneter va.hles have been set by the au- 
thors on the basis of the investigation of sum- 
ma.riza.tions of va.rious documents. 
Two importa,nt topics, the opening (first a.l;- 
tack by %lpac Ama.ru) a.nd the settlement (a.t- 
tack by the Peruvia.u government comma.n- 
(los), have been extracted fl'om the four highest 
rmiked articles, even though temporal informa.- 
tion has not been incort)or~tted in the aJgorithm. 
Tile opening aa'ticle, is the first a.rticle of the 
sample document set. However, the settlement 
a ri, ich; is the sixth \]a.st one. So mere extra.ction 
of the last m'tic, le would miss the settlement.

5 Conc lus ion  
Summarization of multiple documents about 
nmltiple topics has been discussed in this pa- 
pet'. The method proposed here uses spread- 
ing activation over documents syntactically and 
semanticMly annotated with GDA tags. It is 
capable of: 
? extraction of the opening and settlement 
articles from fifty articles about a hostage 
incident, 
? creation of an entity-relation graph of im- 
portant relations among important entities, 
? extraction and pruning of important sen- 
tences, gnd 
? substitution of expressions with more con- 
crete ones using cross-document corefer- 
ences. 
The inethod is essentially multilingual because 
it is based on GDA tags gild the GDA tagset 
is designed to address nmltilingual coverage. 
Since this tagset can en,bed various linguistic 
intbrination into documents, it could be a stan- 
dard tbrmat for the study of the transformation 
and/or generdtion stage of doculnent summa- 
rization, among other natural language process- 
ing tasks.
