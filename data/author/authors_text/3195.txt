Abstract 
This paper presents two word segmenta-
tion (WS) systems and a named entity 
recognition (NER) system in France 
Telecom R&D Beijing. The one system 
of WS is for open tracks based on n-
gram language model and another one is 
for closed tracks based on maximum en-
tropy approach. The NER system uses a 
hybrid algorithm based on Class-based 
language model and rule-based knowl-
edge. These systems are all augmented 
with a set of post-processors.  
1 Introduction 
The FTRD team participated in MSRA Open, 
MSRA Closed and CityU Closed tracks of the 
WS bakeoff and MSRA Open track of the NER 
bakeoff, and achieved the state-of-the-art per-
formance in these tracks. Analysis of the results 
shows that each component of these systems 
contributed to the scores. 
2 System Description 
2.1 MSRA Open track of WS 
The system used in open track of WS is based on 
the system (Li 2005) participated in the second 
international WS bakeoff. We mainly modify the 
factoid detection rules and add the GKB (The 
Grammatical Knowledge-base of Contemporary 
Chinese) dictionary. The system also has a few 
postprocessors. The main postprocessors include 
named entity recognizers and TBL (Transforma-
tion-Based Learning) component. 
2.1.1 Basic system  
In our basic system, Chinese words can be cate-
gorized into one of the following types: lexicon 
words, morphological words, factoids, name en-
tities. These types of words were processed in 
different ways in our system, and were incorpo-
rated into a unified statistical framework of the 
trigram language model. The details about the 
basic system are reported in (Li 2005). 
2.1.2 Factoid detection 
The factoid rules used in the basic system were 
summarized according to the MSRA training 
data. The Tokenization Guidelines of Chinese 
Text (V5.0) was provided by MSRA in this 
bakeoff. We used the Guidelines to rewrite the 
factoid rules, and the performance had the dis-
tinct improvement.  
122
2.1.3 Named entity identification  
The named entity recognizer is the one partici-
pated in the NER bakeoff, as shown in figure 1. 
In the section 2.3, we will describe in detail. 
2.2 System Used in Close tracks 
The system used in closed tracks of WS is based 
on maximum entropy approach. The system also 
has a few postprocessors. The main postproces-
sors include combining the separated words and 
TBL component. 
2.2.1 Basic system 
The basic system is similar to (Ng and Low, 
2004). We used the Tsujii laboratory maximum 
entropy package v2.0 (http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-
tokyo.ac.jp/~tsuruoka/maxent/) to train our mod-
els. For CityU closed track, the basic features are 
the same as (Ng and Low, 2004). For MSRA 
closed track, we used two sets of basic features. 
The one is similar to (Ng and Low, 2004) and we 
change the window size of another one from 2 to 
3, so we trained two models for MSRA closed 
track and submitted two results.  
2.2.2 Post processing 
Firstly, we extracted one lexicon from each train-
ing data. For MSRA closed track, the postpro-
cessor only combined the words which appeared 
in the lexicon but were separated in the test result. 
For CityU closed track, we firstly used the fac-
toid tool provided by the open system of WS to 
combine the separated factoid words, and then 
we used the lexicon to combine the separated 
words, at last the TBL was applied to the test 
result. 
2.3 MSRA Open track of NER 
The system used a hybrid algorithm which can 
combine a class-based statistical model (Gao 
2004) with various types of rule-based knowl-
edge very well. All the words were categorized 
into three types: Lexicon words (LWs), Factoid 
words (FTs), Named Entity (NEs). Accordingly, 
three main components were included to identify 
each kind of named entities: basic word candi-
dates, NE combination and Viterbi search, as 
shown in Figure 1.  
  
Figure 1 FTRD NE Recognizer 
The recognizer was applied to open track of WS 
and we used it to participate in the MSRA open 
track of NER. The system also had a TBL post-
processor. 
2.4 TBL 
In our system, the open source toolkit fnTBL 
(http://nlp.cs.jhu.edu/~rflorian/fntbl/index.html) 
is chosen. Coping with word segmentation task, 
we utilized a method called ?LMR? tagging 
which was the same as (Nianwen Xue and Libin 
Shen 2003). Two rule template sets were used in 
our system. The complicated one had 40 tem-
plates, which covered various kinds of words 
position and tag position occurrence, i.e., consid-
ering contextual information of words and tags. 
For example, rule ?pos_0 word_0 word_1 
word_2 => pos? could generate rules containing 
information about current word, current word?s 
tag, the next word and the word after next. The 
other rule template neglected tag information, it 
took only contextual word information into ac-
count. For an instance, ?word_0 word_1 word_2 
=> pos?. The task of WS applied the two rule 
template sets, and the task of NER only applied 
the complicated one. In the Section 3, we will 
compare the two rule template sets. 
3 Evaluation 
3.1 Open tracks 
3.1.1 MSRA Open track of WS 
In this open track, we used one lexicon of 
294,382 entries, which included the entries of 
42,430 MDWs (Morphological Derived Words) 
generated from the GKB dictionary, 12,487 PNs, 
22,907 LNs and 29,032 ONs, 10,414 four-
character idioms, plus the word lists generated 
from the training data provided by the second 
international Chinese Word Segmentation bake-
off and 80114 GKB words. We also used the 
training data provided by the last bakeoff for 
training our trigram word-based language model.  
123
    Table 1 presents the results of this track. For 
comparison, we also include in the table (Row 1) 
the results of basic system. From Row 2 to Row 
11, it shows the relative contribution of each 
component and resource to the overall word 
segmentation performance. The second column 
shows the recall, the third column the precision, 
and the fourth column F-score. The last two col-
umns present the recall of the OOV words and 
the recall of IV words, respectively.

Table1: Our system results on Open tracks 
From Table 1 we can find that, in Row 1, the 
basic system participated in the last bakeoff al-
ready achieves quite good recall, but the recall of 
OOV is not very good because it cannot correctly 
identify unknown words that are not in the lexi-
con such as factoids and name entities (espe-
cially the nested named entity) and new words 
(except factoids, named entities and words ab-
stracted from training data). In Row 2, we only 
rewrite the factoid rules according to the MSRA 
Guidelines, and the recall of OOV improves sig-
nificantly while the recall of IV falls slightly. It 
shows that the factoid detection affects the recall 
of IV. As shown in Table 1, the GKB lexicon has 
made significant and persistent progress in all 
performance because the GKB lexicon is refined 
and the words are conformed to the MSRA stan-
dard. We also find that the NE postprocessor can 
improve the recall of OOV but affects slightly 
the recall of IV in all experiments. It shows that 
our named entity recognition has make im-
provement compared with that of last year. As 
shown in Table 1, TBL has made slightly but 
persistent progress in all steps it applies to. After 
TBL adaptation OOV recall stays almost un-
changed, for the rules are derived from training 
corpus, and no OOV words would meet the con-
dition of applying them in theory, but IV recall 
improves, which compensates the loss of IV re-
call caused by NE post-process and the factoid 
detection. It is interesting comparing the per-
formance of two TBL template sets, the first 
template set is simple and the threshold for gen-
erating rules is 3 by default (called TBL in Table 
1), and the second is more complicated with a 
"0" threshold (called New TBL in Table 1). The 
number of rules generated is 1061 and 12135 
respectively. Our experiments demonstrate that 
more precise rule template set with low threshold 
always leads to better performance, for they 
could cover more situations, although a simple 
rule template set with high threshold does better 
in OOV word recognition. 
3.1.2 MSRA Open track of NER 
In the track, we used People's Daily 2000 corpus 
(Yu, 2003) for building our lexicon and training 
our model.  
    Considering that organization names are ir-
regular in their forms compared with person 
names and location names, and there are many 
abbreviations and anaphora, TBL adaptation may 
degrade the performance of organization,   we 
submitted two results, as shown in Table 2. 
1+TBL1 means that TBL only adapt person and 
location results of basic system, the organization 
performance of basic system and 1+TBL1 would 
be identical. 1+TBL2 means TBL adapt all three 
types of NE.  For comparison, we list (Column 2) 
the results of basic system. The Row 2 to Row 
13 shows the recall, the precision, and the F-
score of PN, LN, ON and total.

Table 2: MSRA Open track of NER 
To our surprise, performance listed in Table 2 
demonstrates that applying TBL causes a dra-
matic improvement in all three types of NE, es-
pecially organization performance. The great 
similarity between training corpus and test cor-
pus of MSRA may explain this. For the inconsis-
tency of standard between MSRA and PKU, the 
recall, especially of the ONs, is not very good. 
We did some effort in the standard adaptation, 
such as constraint the length and type of candi-
date words in combining the named entities, but 
the result is not very good. 
3.2 Closed tracks

Table 4: Our system results on CityU Closed 
In Table 3, the basic system (2) shows the win-
dow size of the template is 2 and the basic sys-
tem (3) is 3. As is shown in the table, except the 
precision and the recall of OOV, the performance 
of window size with 2 outperforms that of win-
dow size with 3. 
    In Table 4, the system 6' is the one we submit-
ted in this closed CityU track, but the system 6 is 
better than the system 6'. In TBL training, we 
made a mistake that the training data weren't 
processed by factoid tool and lexicon combining. 
We also can find that the factoid tool doesn't im-
prove the performance. The system 6 isn't the 
best one (system 3).  
    Combining the separated words according to 
training lexicon improved the performance of 
both MSRA and CITYU closed track. In the 
meantime, TBL worked considerably well in all 
closed tracks. 
4 Conclusions 
The evaluation results show that the performance 
of NER need be improved in abbreviations rec-
ognition and anaphora resolution.
