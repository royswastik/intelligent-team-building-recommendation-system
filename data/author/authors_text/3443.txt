Abstract 
Automatic summarization is an active research 
area in natural language processing. This paper has 
proposed a special method that produces text 
summary by detecting thematic areas in Chinese 
document. The specificity of the method is that the 
produced summary can both cover many different 
themes and reduce its redundancy obviously at the 
same time. In this method, the detection of latent 
thematic areas is realized by adopting K-medoids 
clustering method as well as a novel clustering 
analysis method, which can be used to determine 
automatically K, the number of clusters.. In 
addition, a novel parameter, which is known as 
representation entropy, is used for summarization 
redundancy evaluation. Experimental results 
indicate a clear superiority of the proposed method  
over the traditional non-thematic-area-detection 
method under the proposed evaluation scheme 
when dealing with different genres of text 
documents with free style and flexible theme 
distribution. 
1 Introduction 
With the approaching information explosion, 
people begin to feel at a loss about the mass of 
information. Because the effectiveness  of the 
existing information retrieval technology is still 
unsatisfactory, it becomes a problem to efficiently 
find the information mostly related to the needs of 
customers retrieval results so that customers can 
easily accept or reject the retrieved information 
without needing to look at the original retrieval 
results. This paper has proposed a new 
summarization method, where K-medoid 
clustering method is applied to detect all possible 
partitions of thematic areas, and a novel clustering 
analysis method, which is based on a self-defined 
objective function, is applied to automatically 
determine K, the number of latent thematic areas in a 
document  
This method consists of three main stages: 1) Find 
out the thematic areas in the document by adopting the 
K-medoid clustering method (Kaufmann and 
Rousseeuw, 1987as well as a novel clustering analysis 
method. 2) From each thematic area, find a sentence 
which has the maximum semantic similarity value 
with this area as the representation. 3) Output the 
selected sentences to form the final summary 
according to their pos itions in the original document. 
To validate the effectiveness of the proposed 
method, use this method as well as the traditional 
non-thematic -areas-detection method on our 
experimental samples to generate two groups of 
summaries. Next, make a comparison between them. 
The final results show a clear superiority of our 
method over the traditional one in the scores of the 
evaluation parameters. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as 
follows. In the next section, we review related 
methods that are commonly discussed in the 
automatic summarization literature. Section 3 
describes our method in detail. The evaluation 
methodology and experimental results are presented 
in Section 4. Finally, we conclude with a discussion 
and future work. 
2 Related Work  
The research of automatic summarization begins with 
H.P.Luhn?s work. By far, a large number of scholars 
have taken part in the research and had many 
achievements. Most of the researchers have 
concentrated on the sentence-extraction 
summarization method (the so-called shallower 
approach) (Wang et al, 2003; Nomoto and 
Matsumoto, 2001; Gong and Liu, 2001), but not the 
sentence-generation method (the so-called deeper 
approach)(Yang and Zhong., 1998). On the one hand, 
it is caused by the high complexity and the severe 
limitation of practical fields of rational natural 
language processing technology and knowledge 
engineering technology. On the other hand, it is 
closely associated with the great achievements in 
many fields of natural language processing by 
statistical research methods, machine learning 
methods and pattern recognition methods in recent 
years (Mani, 2001). 
The summarization method of sentence-
extraction can roughly be divided into two kinds: 
supervised and unsupervised (Nomoto and 
Matsumoto, 2001). Generally, the realization of the 
former relies on plenty of manual summaries, that 
is so-called ?Gold Standards? which help 
determining the relevant parameters of the 
statistical model for summarization. However, not 
all people believe that manual summaries are 
reliable, so the researchers have begun to 
investigate the general unsupervised method, 
which can avoid the requirement of support of 
manual summaries. Nevertheless it is soon 
discovered that the summaries produced by this 
method can?t cover all the themes and have great 
redundancy at the same time. Usually, it can only 
cover those intensively distributed themes while 
neglects others. So researchers in Nanjing 
University proposed a summarization method 
based on the analysis of the discourse structure to 
overcome these problems (Wang et al, 2003). By 
making statistics of the reduplicated words in the 
adjacent paragraphs of the document, the semantic 
distances among them can be worked out. Then 
analyse the thematic structure of the document and 
extract sentences from each theme to form a 
summary. It is ideal to employ this method while 
dealing with those documents with standard 
discourse structure, because it can effectively 
avoid the problems caused by the summarization 
method without discourse structure analysis. Yet 
when the writing style of a document is rather free 
and the distribution of the themes is variable, that 
is the same theme can be distributed in several 
paragraphs not adjacent to each other, then the use 
of this method can?t be equally effective. 
To deal with a lot of Chinese documents which 
have free style of writing and flexible themes, a 
sentence-extraction summarization method created 
by detecting thematic areas is tried following such 
work as (Nomoto and Matsumoto, 2001; Salton et 
al., 1996; Salton et al, 1997; Carbonell and 
Goldstein, 1998; Lin and Hovy, 2000). The 
thematic areas detection in a document is obtained 
through the adaptive clustering of paragraphs (cf. 
Moens et al 1999), so it can overcome in a certain 
degree the defects of the above methods in dealing 
with the documents with rather flexible theme 
distribution. 
3 The Algorithm 
In this section, the proposed method will be 
introduced in detail. The method consists of the 
following three main stages: 
Stage 1: Find the different thematic areas in the 
document through paragraph clustering and 
clustering analysis. 
Stage 2: Select the most suitable sentence from 
each thematic area as the representative 
one. 
Stage 3: Make the representative sentences form 
the final summary according to certain 
requirements. 
3.1 Stage 1: Thematic Area Detection 
The process of thematic area detection is displayed in 
Figure 1. 
The each step of Figure 1 is explained in the 
following subsections.

3.1.1 Step 1: Term Extraction 
 
Different from the general word segmentation 
operation adopted in the traditional Chinese 
automatic summarization research, we do not take the 
general operation when pre-processing the original

document, but make use of the method introduced 
by (Liu et al, 2003) to extract terms 
from the document and then express its content by 
such metadata elements as terms.  
The greatest advantage of term extraction 
technology is that it needs no support of fixed 
thesaurus, only through the continuous updating 
and making statistics of a real corpus. We can 
dynamically establish and update a term bank and 
improve the extraction quality through continuous 
correcting of the parameters for extraction. Thus it 
is of wide practical prospects for natural language 
processing. In addition, the terms can represent a 
relative specific meaning, because most of them 
are phrases, which consist of multi-characters. 
 
3.1.2 Step 2: Vector Representation and Weight 
Calculation of Paragraph 
 
The advantage of the vector space model (VSM) is 
that it successfully makes the unstructured 
documents structured which makes it possible to 
handle the massive real documents by adopting the 
existing mathematical instruments. All the terms 
extracted from the document are considered as the 
features of a vector, while the values of the 
features are statistics of the terms. According to 
this, we can set up the VSM of paragraphs, that is 
each paragraph Pi (i:1~M,M is the number of all 
paragraphs in a document) is represented as the 
vector of weights of terms, VPi, VPi =
( WPi1,WPi2,?,WPiN)  
Where N is the total number of terms, WPij 
denotes the weight of the j-th term in the i-th 
paragraph. There are many methods of calculating 
WPij, such as tf, tf*idf, mutual information (Patrick 
Pantel and Lin, 2002), etc. The method adopted 
here (Gong and Liu, 2001) is shown as follows: 
 
WPi j= log(1+TF(Ti j))*log(M/Mj ) (1) 
 
Where TF(Tij) denotes the number of occurrence 
of the j-th term in the i-th paragraph, M/Mj denotes 
the inverse paragraph frequency of term j, and Mj 
denotes the number of paragraphs in which term j 
occurs. In accordance, on the basis of defining 
WPij, we can further define the weight of 
paragraph P i, W(P i), by the follwing formula: 
 (2) 
 
In formula (2), n represents the total number of 
different terms occurring in the i-th paragraph. 
3.1.3 Step 3: Paragraph Clustering and 
Clustering Analysis  
 
1) Paragraph clustering 
The existing clustering algorithms can be 
categorized as hierarchical (e.g. agglomerative etc) 
and partitional (e.g. K-means, K-medoids, etc) 
(Pantel and Lin, 2002). 
The complexity of the hierarchical clustering 
algorithm is O(n2Log(n)) , where n is the number 
of elements to be clustered, which is usually 
greater than that of the partitional method. For 
example, the complexity of K-means is linear in n. 
So in order to achieve high efficiency of algorithm, 
we choose the latter to cluster paragraphs. 
K-means clustering algorithm is a fine choice in 
many circumstances, because it is simple and 
effective. But in the process of clustering by means 
of K-means, the quality of clustering is greatly 
affected by the elements that marginally belong to 
the cluster, and the centroid can?t represent the real 
element in the cluster, So while choosing the 
paragraphs clustering algorithm, we adopt K-
medoids (Kaufmann and Rousseeuw, 1987; Moens 
et al 1999) which is less sensitive to the effect of 
marginal elements than K-means. 
Suppose that every sample point in the N-
dimensional sample space respectively represent a 
paragraph vector, and the clustering of paragraphs 
can be visualized as that of the M sample points in 
the sample space. Here N is the number of terms in 
the document and M is the number of paragraphs. 
Table 1 shows the formal description of the 
paragraph clustering process based on K-medoids 
method. 
2) Clustering analysis 
A classical problem when adopting K-medoid 
clustering method and many other clustering 
methods is the determination of K, the number of 
clusters. In traditional K-medoid method, K must 
be offered by the user in advance. In many cases, 
it?s impractical. As to clustering of paragraphs, 
customers can?t predict the latent thematic number 
in the document, so it?s impossible to offer K 
correctly. 
In view of the problem, the authors put forward a 
new clustering analysis method to automatically 
determine the value of K according to the 
distribution of values of the self-defined objective 
function. The basic idea is that if K, the number of 
clusters,  is  determined  with  each  value of K, and   
  
  
 
Input: <a, b>, they respectively denote the 
paragraph matrix composed by all the 
paragraph vectors in the document and 
the number of clusters, k (the range of k 
is set to 2~M). 
 
Step 1: randomly select k paragraph vectors as 
the initial medoids of the clusters (here, 
the medoids denote the representative 
paragraphs of k clusters). 
Step 2: assign each paragraph vector to a cluster 
according to the medoid X closest to it. 
Step 3: calculate the Euclidean distance between 
all the paragraph vectors and their closest 
medoids. 
Step  4: randomly select a paragraph vector Y. 
Step 5: to all the X, if it can reduce the 
Euclidean distance between all the 
paragraph vectors and their closest 
medoids by interchanging X and Y, then 
change their positions, otherwise keep as 
the original. 
Step 6: repeat from step 2 to 5 until no changes 
take place. 
 
Output: <A, B, C>, they respectively denote the 
cluster id, the representative paragraph 
vector and all the paragraph vectors of 
each cluster under the k clusters. 
Table 1: Paragraph clustering process based on 
K-medoid method 
suitably, then the corresponding clustering 
results can well distinguish the different themes 
in the document, and correspondingly the 
average of the sum of the weight of the 
representative paragraph under each theme will 
tend to maximize. We call this the maximum 
property of the objective function. 
 
Correspondingly, we define the following 
objective function Objf(K) to reflect clustering 
quality and determine the number of clusters, K.

 (3) 
Where W(Pj) denotes the weight of the 
selected representative paragraph in the j-th 
cluster, here the selected representative 
paragraph Pj can be regarded as the medoid in 
the j-th cluster which is determined by the final 
output of the presented K-medoid paragraph 
clustering process, and the weight of Pj is 
calculated by formula (2). Put the objective 
function in K clustering results corresponding 
then make good use of the maximum property of 
the objective function to adaptively determine the 
final number of clusters, K. 
Figure 2 shows the concrete distribution of the 
values of objective function obtained in the 
example document ?On the Situation and Measures 
That Face Fishing in the Sea in Da Lian City? 
when adopting the proposed clustering analysis 
method. According to the maximum property of 
objective function, that is take the value of K when 
the values of the objective function take maximum 
as the final number of clusters. From the results in 
Figure 2, we can know that K equals to six, that is 
we find six latent thematic areas from nine 
paragraphs in the document with this method.

3.1.4 Step 4: Thematic Area Detection 
 
Output the complete information table of each 
thematic area in the form of the representative 
paragraph and all the paragraphs and sentences 
covered by the thematic area. 
 
3.2 Stage 2: Selection of the Thematic 
Representative Sentences 
 
To select a most suitable representative sentence 
from each thematic area, the author proposes the 
following method. This is in contrast  with a 
method proposed by Radev (Radev et al, 2000 ), 
where the centroid of a cluster is selected as the 
representative one. 
Method: select the sentence which is most 
similar to the thematic area semantically as 
representative one. 
Before carrying out the method in detail, there 
are two problems to be solved: 
1) The vector representation of sentence and 
thematic area 
The vector representation of sentence and 
thematic area is similar to that of paragraph 
introduced before. We only need to change the 
weight calculation field of the terms from the 
interior of paragraph to the interior of sentence 
or thematic area. Accordingly, we can describe 
the sentence vector and thematic area vector as 
follows 
VSj= ( WSj1,WSj2,?,WSjN)  
VAk= ( WAk1,WAk2,?,WAkN)  
 
2) The semantic similarity calculation between 
sentence and thematic area 
The calculation of semantic similarity of 
sentence and thematic area can be achieved by 
calculating the vector distance between sentence 
vector and thematic area vector. Here we adopt 
the traditional cosine method for vector distance 
calculation. Correspondingly, the distance 
between the sentence vector VSj and the thematic 
area vector VAk is calculated by the following 
formula:

Principles of evaluating summarization redundancy 
 
At the premise of the same number of 
summarization sentences selected out by 
different summarization methods: 
 
The higher the value of RE calculated by the 
covariance matrix of the summarization sentence 
vectors. 
The lower the summarization redundancy.

4 Experimental Results and Performance 
Evaluation 
4.1 Evaluation Methodology 
It is challenging to objectively evaluate the qua lity of 
different automatic summarization methods. Methods 
for evaluation can be broadly classified into two 
categories: intrinsic and extrinsic (Mani, 2001). We 
adopt the former to evaluate the quality of 
summarization by defining the following parameters 
for evaluation. 
1) Theme coverage (TC) 
The definition of TC is the percentage of the 
thematic contents covered by the selected 
summarization sentences. The value of the 
parameter can be got by means of the works of 
some experts. 
2) Representation entropy (RE) 
In order to effectively and objectively evaluate the 
redundancy of the produced summary, we refer to 
the parameter which was initially proposed by 
(Mitra et al, 2002) for evaluating the feature 
redundancy in the process of feature selection and 
transform it into the novel parameter to evaluate 
the summarization redundancy. 
According to this, some important notations are 
defined as follows: 
 
 
N Number of terms in the original 
document ;  
Nz Number of sentences in the 
produced summary ;  
Lz 
Nz-by-N matrix composed by 
all the sentence vectors in the 
produced summary ;  
?z 
Nz-by-Nz covariance matrix 
composed by all the sentence 
vectors in the produced 
summary ;

The novel evaluation parameter proposed by us 
can objectively evaluate the quality of the produced

quality of the produced summary. 
 
4.2 Experimental Results 
We randomly extract 200 documents of different 
genres from the Modern Chinese Corpus of State 
Language Commission to form the experimental 
corpus. Because summarizing short documents 
doesn?t make much sense in real applications (Gong 
and Liu, 2001), we select 30 documents of more 
than 400 characters from the corpus as the samples 
which are summarized by the proposed 
summarization method (method 1 for abbreviation) 
and the traditional non-thematic -area-detection 
method (method 2 for abbreviation), that is the 
method of determining the weights of sentences in a 
document, sorting them in a decreasing order, and 
selecting the top sentences in the end. The specific 
experimental data and evaluation results of 
parameters are given in table 3 and table 4. 
The synthetic evaluation of the 30 samples proves 
that our method under the above evaluation 
parameters is superior to the traditional non-
thematic-area-detection  summarization method 
when dealing with different genres of text 
documents with free style and flexible theme 
distribution, and the results we have achieved are 
encouraging. 
 
5 Conclusions 
In this paper, we have proposed a new 
summarization method based on thematic areas 
detection. By adopting a novel clustering analysis 
method, it can adaptively detect the different 
thematic areas in the document, and automatically 
determine K, the number of thematic areas. So the 
produced summary can both cover as many as 
different themes and reduce its redundancy 
obviously at the same time. 
 For our experiment, we used three different 
parameters to evaluate the quality of the produced 
summaries in theme coverage and summarization 
redundancy. We achieved a better performance than 
the traditional non-thematic -areas-detection method 
in the proposed evaluation scheme. As a future 
work , we need the additional research for testing 
the proposed method on la rger-scale real corpora , 
and have the further comparison with earlier similar 
works such as MMR, etc. In addition, we?ll 
improve our summarization system by considering 
the structure of thematic areas and user?s 
requirement.
