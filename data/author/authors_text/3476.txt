Abstract 
Product reviews posted at online shopping 
sites vary greatly in quality. This paper ad-
dresses the problem of detecting low-
quality product reviews. Three types of bi-
ases in the existing evaluation standard of 
product reviews are discovered. To assess 
the quality of product reviews, a set of spe-
cifications for judging the quality of re-
views is first defined. A classification-
based approach is proposed to detect the 
low-quality reviews. We apply the pro-
posed approach to enhance opinion sum-
marization in a two-stage framework. Ex-
perimental results show that the proposed 
approach effectively (1) discriminates low-
quality reviews from high-quality ones and 
(2) enhances the task of opinion summari-
zation by detecting and filtering low-
quality reviews. 
1 Introduction 
In the past few years, there has been an increasing 
interest in mining opinions from product reviews 
(Pang, et al 2002; Liu, et al 2004; Popescu and 
Etzioni, 2005). However, due to the lack of 
editorial and quality control, reviews on products 
vary greatly in quality. Thus, it is crucial to have a 
mechanism capable of assessing the quality of 
reviews and detecting low-quality/noisy reviews.  
Some shopping sites already provide a function 
of assessing the quality of reviews. For example, 
Amazon1 allows users to vote for the helpfulness 
of each review and then ranks the reviews based on 
the accumulated votes. However, according to our 
survey in Section 3, users? votes at Amazon have 
three kinds of biases as follows: (1) imbalance vote 
bias, (2) winner circle bias, and (3) early bird bias. 
Existing studies (Kim et al 2006; Zhang and Va-
radarajan, 2006) used these users? votes for train-
ing ranking models to assess the quality of reviews, 
which therefore are subject to these biases.  
In this paper, we demonstrate the aforemen-
tioned biases and define a standard specification to 
measure the quality of product reviews. We then 
manually annotate a set of ground-truth with real 
world product review data conforming to the speci-
fication.  
To automatically detect low-quality product re-
views, we propose a classification-based approach 
learned from the annotated ground-truth. The pro-
posed approach explores three aspects of product 
reviews, namely informativeness, readability, and 
subjectiveness.  
We apply the proposed approach to opinion 
summarization, a typical opinion mining task. The 
proposed approach enhances the existing work in a 
two-stage framework, where the low-quality re-
view detection is applied right before the summari-
zation stage.  
Experimental results show that the proposed ap-
proach can discriminate low-quality reviews from 
high-quality ones effectively. In addition, the task 
of opinion summarization can be enhanced by de-
tecting and filtering low-quality reviews.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: 
Section 2 introduces the related work. In Section 3, 
we define the quality of product reviews. In Sec-
tion 4, we present our approach to detecting low-
quality reviews. In Section 5, we empirically verify 
the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its 
use for opinion summarization. Section 6 summa-
rizes our work in this paper and points out the fu-
ture work. 
2 Related Work 
2.1 Evaluating Helpfulness of Reviews 
The problem of evaluating helpfulness of reviews 
(Kim et al 2006), also known as learning utility of 
reviews (Zhang and Varadarajan, 2006), is quite 
similar to our problem of assessing the quality of 
reviews.  
In practice, researchers in this area considered 
the problem as a ranking problem and solved it 
with regression models. In the process of model 
training and testing, they used the ground-truth 
derived from users? votes of helpfulness provided 
by Amazon. As we will show later in Section 3, 
these models all suffered from three types of vot-
ing bias.  
In our work, we avoid using users? votes by de-
veloping a specification on the quality of reviews 
and building a ground-truth according to the speci-
fication.  
2.2 Mining Opinions from Reviews 
One area of research on opinion mining from 
product reviews is to judge whether a review 
expresses a positive or a negative opinion. For 
example, Turney (2006) presented a simple 
unsupervised learning algorithm in judging 
reviews as ?thumbs up? (recommended) or 
?thumbs down? (not recommended). Pang et al
(2002) considered the same problem and presented 
a set of supervised machine learning approaches to 
it. For other work see also Dave et al (2003), Pang 
and Lee (2004, 2005). 
Another area of research on opinion mining is to 
extract and summarize users? opinions from prod-
uct reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004; Liu et al, 2005; 
Popescu and Etzioni, 2005). Typically, a sentence 
or a text segment in the reviews is treated as the 
basic unit. The polarity of users? sentiments on a 
product feature in each unit is extracted. Then the 
aggregation of the polarities of individual senti-
ments is presented to users so that they can have an 
at-a-glance view on how other experienced users 
rated on a certain product. The major weakness in 
the existing studies is that all the reviews, includ-
ing low-quality ones, are taken into consideration 
and treated equally for generating the summary. In 
this paper, we enhance the application by detecting 
and filtering low-quality reviews. In order to 
achieve that, we first define what the quality of 
reviews is. 
3 Quality of Product Reviews 
In this section, we will first show three biases of 
users? votes observed on Amazon, and then present 
our specification on the quality of product reviews. 
3.1 Amazon Ground-truth 
In our study, we use the product reviews on digital 
cameras crawled from Amazon as our data set. The 
data set consists of 23,141 reviews on 946 digital 
cameras. At the Amazon site, users could vote for 
a review with a ?helpful? or ?unhelpful? label. 
Thus, for each review there are two numbers 
indicating the statistics of these two labels, namely 
the number of ?helpful? votes and that of 
?unhelpful? ones. Kim et al(2006) used the 
percentage of ?helpful? votes as the measure of 
evaluating the ?quality of reviews? in their 
experiments. We call the ground-truth based on 
this measure as ?Amazon ground-truth?. 
Certainly, the ground-truth has the advantage of 
convenience. However, we identify three types of 
biases that make the Amazon ground-truth not al-
ways suitable for determining the quality of re-
views. We describe these biases in details in the 
rest of this section. 
3.1.1 Imbalance Vote Bias

opinions positively rather than negatively. From

reviews (corresponding to the two bars on the right 
of the figure) have more than 90% ?helpful? votes, 
including 9,100 reviews with 100% ?helpful? 
votes. From an in-depth investigation on these 
highly-voted reviews, we observed that some did 
not really have as good quality as the votes hint. 
For example, in Figure 2, the review about Canon 
PowerShot S500 receives 40 ?helpful? votes out of 
40 votes although it only gives very brief 
description on the product features in its second 
paragraph. We call this type of bias ?imbalance 
vote? bias. 
 
This is my second Canon digital elph camera. Both were great 
cameras. Recently upgraded to the S500. About 6 months later I get 
the dreaded E18 error. I searched the Internet and found numerous 
people having problems. When I determined the problem to be the 
lens not fully extending I decided to give it a tug. It clicked and the 
camera came on, ready to take pictures. Turning it off and on pro-
duced the E18 again. While turning it on I gave it a nice little bump 
on the side (where the USB connector is) and the lens popped out 
on its own. No problems since. 
 It?s a nice compact and light camera and takes great photos and 
videos. Only complaint (other than E18) is the limit of 30-second 
videos on 640x480 mode. I've got a 512MB compact flash card, I 
should be able to take as much footage as I have memory in one 
take. 
Figure 2. An example review 
3.1.2 Winner Circle Bias 
 
Figure 3. Votes of the top-50 ranked reviews 
There also exists a bootstrapping effect of ?hot? 
reviews at the Amazon site. Figure 3 shows the 
?helpful? votes for the top 50 ranked reviews. The 
numbers are averaged over 127 digital cameras 
which have no less than 50 reviews. As shown in 
this figure, the top two reviews hold more than 250 
and 140 votes respectively on average; while the 
numbers of votes held by lower-ranked reviews 
decrease exponentially. This is so-called the 
?winner circle? bias: the more votes a review 
gains, the more default authority it would appear to 
the readers, which in turn will influence the 
objectivity of the readers? votes. Also, the higher 
ranked reviews would attract more eyeballs and 
therefore gain more people?s votes. This mutual 
influence among labelers should be avoided when 
the votes are used as the evaluation standard. 
3.1.3 Early Bird Bias 
 
   
Figure 4. Dependency on publication date 
Publication date can influence the accumulation of 
users? votes. In Figure 4, the n?th publication date 
represents the n?th month after the product is 
released. The number in the figure is averaged over 
all the digital cameras in the data set. We can 
observe a clear trend that the earlier a review is 
posted, the more votes it will get. This is simply 
because reviews posted earlier are exposed to users 
for a longer time. Therefore, some high quality 
reviews may get fewer users? vote because of later 
publication. We call this ?early bird? bias. 
3.2 Specification of Quality 
Besides these aforementioned biases, using the raw 
rating from readers directly also fails to provide a 
clear guideline for what a good review consists of. 
In this section, we provide such a guideline, which 
we name as the specification (SPEC). 
In the SPEC, we define four categories of re-
view quality which represent different values of 
the reviews to users? purchase decision: ?best re-
view?, ?good review?, ?fair review?, and ?bad re-
view?. A generic description of the SPEC is as fol-
lows: 
A best review must be a rather complete and de-
tailed comment on a product. It presents several 
aspects of a product and provides convincing opi-
nions with enough evidence. Usually a best review 
could be taken as the main reference that users on-
ly need to read before making their purchase deci-
sion on a certain product. The first review in Fig-
ure 5 is a best review. It presents several product 
features and provides convincing opinions with 
sufficient evidence. It is also in a good format for 
readers to easily understand. Note that we omit 
some words in the example to save the space.

A good review is a relatively complete comment 
on a product, but not with as much supporting evi-
dence as necessary. It could be used as a strong 
and influential reference, but not as the only rec-
ommendation. The second review in Figure 5 is 
such an example. 
A fair review contains a very brief description 
on a product. It does not supply detailed evaluation 
on the product, but only comments on some as-
pects of the product. For example, the third review 
in Figure 5 mainly talks about ?the delay between 
pictures?, but less about other aspects of the cam-
era. 
A bad review is usually an incorrect description 
of a product with misleading information. It talks 
little about a specific product but much about some 
general topics (e.g. photography). For example, the 
last review in Figure 5 talks about the topic of ?ge-
neric battery?, but does not specify any digital 
camera. A bad review is an ?unhelpful? review that 
can be ignored.  
 
Best Review: 
I purchased this camera about six months ago after my Kodak 
Easyshare camera completely died on me. I did a little research 
and read only good things about this Canon camera so I decided to 
go with it because it was very reasonably priced (about $200). Not 
only did the camera live up to my expectations, it surpassed them 
by leaps and bounds! Here are the things I have loved about this 
camera: 
 
BATTERY - this camera has the best battery of any digital cam-
era I have ever owned or used. ? 
 
EASY TO USE - I was able to ? 
 
PICTURE QUALITY - all of the pictures I've taken and printed 
out have been great. ? 
 
FEATURES - I love the ability to quickly and easily ? 
 
LCD SCREEN - I was hoping ? 
 
SD MEMORY CARD - I was also looking for a camera that used 
SD memory cards. Mostly because? 
 
I cannot stress how highly I recommend this camera. I will never 
buy another digital camera besides Canon again. And the A610 (as 
well as the A620 - the 7.0MP version) is the best digital camera I've 
ever used. 
Good Review: 
The Sony DSC "P10" Digital Camera is the top pick for CSC. 
Running against cameras like Olympus stylus, Canon Powereshot, 
Sony V1, Nikon, Fuji, and More. The new release of 5.0 mega pix-
els has shot prices for digital cameras up to $1000+. This camera I 
purchased through a Private Dealer cost me $400.86. The Retail 
Price is Running $499.00 to $599.00. Purchase this camera from a 
wholesale dealer for the best price $377.00. Great Photo Even in 
dim light w/o a flash. The p10 is very compact. Can easily fit into 
any pocket. The camera can record 90 minutes of mpeg like a home 
movie. There are a lot of great digital cameras on the market that 
shoot good pictures and video. What makes the p10 the top pick is 
it comes with a rechargeable lithium battery. Many use AA batte-
ries, the digital camera consumes theses AA batteries in about two 
hours time while the unit is on. That can add continuous expense to 
the camera. It's also the best resolution on the market. 6.0 megapix 
is out, though only a few. And the smallest that we found. Also the 
best price for a major brand. 
Fair Review: 
There is nothing wrong with the 2100 except for the very notice-
able delay between pics. The camera's digital processor takes 
about 5 seconds after a photo is snapped to ready itself for the next 
one. Otherwise, the optics, the 3X optical zoom and the 2 megapixel 
resolution are fine for anything from Internet apps to 8" x 10" print 
enlarging. It is competent, not spectacular, but it gets the job done 
at an agreeable price point. 
Bad Review: 
I want to point out that you should never buy a generic battery, 
like the person from San Diego who reviewed the S410 on May 15, 
2004, was recommending. Yes you'd save money, but there have 
been many reports of generic batteries exploding when charged for 
too long. And don't think if your generic battery explodes you can 
sue somebody and win millions. These batteries are made in sweat-
shops in China, India and Korea, and I doubt you can find anybody 
to sue. So play it safe, both for your own sake and the camera's 
sake. If you want a spare, get a real Canon one.

3.3 Annotation of Quality 
According to the SPEC defined above, we built a 
ground-truth from the Amazon data set. We 
randomly selected 100 digital cameras and 50 
reviews for each camera. Totally we have 4,909 
reviews since some digital cameras have fewer 
than 50 unique reviews. Then we hired two 
annotators to label the reviews with the SPEC as 
their guideline. As the result, we have two 
independent copies of annotations on 4,909 
reviews, with the labels of ?best?, ?good?, ?fair?, 
and ?bad?. Table 1 shows the confusion matrix 
between the two copies of annotation. The value of 
the kappa statistic (Cohen, 1960) calculated from 
the matrix is 0.8142. This shows that the two 
annotators achieved highly consistent results by 
following the SPEC, although they worked 
independently.

tion 1

total 361 885 1,665 1,998 4,909 
Table 1. Confusion matrix bet. the annotations 
 
In order to examine the difference between our 
annotations and Amazon ground-truth, we evaluate 
the Amazon ground-truth against the annotations, 
337
with the measure of ?error rate of preference pairs? 
(Herbrich et al 1999).  
????????? =
|????????? ?????????? ????? |
|??? ?????????? ?????|
 (1) 
where the ?preference pair? is defined as a pair of 
reviews with a order. For example, a best review 
and a good review correspond to a preference pair 
with the order of ?best review preferring to good 
review?. The ?all preference pairs? are collected 
from one of the annotations (the annotation 1 or 
the annotation 2) by ignoring the pairs from the 
same category. The ?incorrect preference pairs? 
are the preference pairs collected from the Ama-
zon ground-truth but not with the same order as 
that in the all preference pairs. The order of the 
preference pair collected from the Amazon 
ground-truth is evaluated on the basis of the per-
centage score as described in Section 3.1.  
The error rate of preference pairs based on the 
annotation 1 and that based on the annotation 2 are 
0.448 and 0.446, respectively, averaged over 100 
digital cameras. The high error rate of preference 
pairs demonstrates that the Amazon ground-truth 
diverges from the annotations (our ground-truth) 
significantly. 
To discover which kind of ground-truth is more 
reasonable, we ask an additional annotator (the 
third annotator) to compare these two kinds of 
ground-truth. More specifically, we randomly se-
lected 100 preference pairs whose orders the two 
kinds of ground-truth don?t agree on (called incor-
rect preference pairs in the evaluation above). As 
for our ground-truth, we choose the Annotation 1 
in the new test. Then, the third annotator is asked 
to assign a preference order for each selected pair. 
Note that the third annotator is blind to both our 
specification and the existing preference order.  
Last, we evaluate the two kinds of ground-truth 
with the new annotation. Among 100 pairs, our 
ground-truth agrees to the new annotation on 85 
pairs while the Amazon ground-truth agrees to the 
new annotation on 15 pairs. To confirm the result, 
yet another annotator (the fourth annotator) is 
called to repeat the same annotation independently 
as the third one. And we obtain the same statistical 
result (85 vs. 15) although the fourth annotator 
does not agree with the third annotator on some 
pairs. 
In practice, we treat the reviews in the first three 
categories (?best?, ?good? and ?fair?) as high-
quality reviews and those in the ?bad? category as 
low-quality reviews, since our goal is to identify 
low quality reviews that should not be considered 
when creating product review summaries. 
4 Classification of Product Reviews  
We employ a statistical machine learning approach 
to address the problem of detecting low-quality 
products reviews.  
Given a training data set? =  ?? ,?? 1
? , we 
construct a model that can minimize the error in 
prediction of y given x (generalization error). Here 
?? ? ?  and ?? = {???? ??????? , ??? ???????} 
represents a product review and a label, 
respectively. When applied to a new instance x, the 
model predicts the corresponding y and outputs the 
score of the prediction. 
4.1 The Learning Model 
In our study, we focus on differentiating low-
quality product reviews from high-quality ones. 
Thus, we treat the task as a binary classification 
problem.  
We employ SVM (Support Vector Machines) 
(Vapnik, 1995) as the model of classification. 
Given an instance x (product review), SVM assigns 
a score to it based on 
? ? = ??? + ? (2) 
where w denotes a vector of weights and b denotes 
an intercept. The higher the value of f(x) is, the 
higher the quality of the instance x is. In 
classification, the sign of f(x) is used. If it is 
positive, then x is classified into the positive 
category (high-quality reviews), otherwise into the 
negative category (low-quality reviews). 
The construction of SVM needs labeled training 
data (in our case, the categories are ?high-quality 
reviews? and ?low-quality reviews?). Briefly, the 
learning algorithm creates the ?hyper plane? in (2), 
such that the hyper plane separates the positive and 
negative instances in the training data with the 
largest ?margin?.  
4.2 Product Feature Resolution 
Product features (e.g., ?image quality? for digital 
camera) in a review are good indicators of review 
quality. However, different product features may 
refer to the same meaning (e.g., ?battery life? and 
?power?), which will bring redundancy in the 
study. In this paper, we formulize the problem as 
the ?resolution of product features?. Thus, the 
338
problem is reduced to how to determine the equi-
valence of a product feature in different forms.  
In (Hu and Liu, 2004), the matching of different 
product features is mentioned briefly and ad-
dressed by fuzzy matching. However, there exist 
many cases where the method fails to match the 
multiple mentions, e.g., ?battery life? and ?power?, 
because it only considers string similarity. In this 
paper we propose to resolve the problem by leve-
raging two kinds of evidence: one is ?surface string? 
evidence, the other is ?contextual evidence?.  
We use edit distance (Ukkonen, 1985) to com-
pare the similarity between the surface strings of 
two mentions, and use contextual similarity to re-
flect the semantic similarity between two mentions. 
When using contextual similarity, we split all 
the reviews into sentences. For each mention of a 
product feature, we take it as a query and search 
for all the relevant sentences. Then we construct a 
vector for the mention, by taking each unique term 
in the relevant sentences as a dimension of the vec-
tor. The cosine similarity between two vectors of 
mentions is then present to measure the contextual 
similarity between two mentions.  
4.3 Feature Development for Learning 
To detect low-quality reviews, our proposed 
approach explores three aspects of product reviews, 
namely informativeness, subjectiveness, and 
readability. We denote the features employed for 
learning as ?learning features?, discriminative from 
the ?product features? we discussed above. 
4.3.1 Features on Informativeness 
As for informativeness, the resolution of product 
features is employed when we generate the 
learning features as listed below. Pairs mapping to 
the same product feature will be treated as the 
same product feature, when we calculate the 
frequency and the number of product features. We 
apply the approach proposed in (Hu and Liu, 2004) 
to extract product features.  
We also use a list of product names and a list of 
brand names to generate the learning features. Both 
lists can be collected from the Amazon site be-
cause they are relatively stable within a time inter-
val. 
The learning features on the informativeness of 
a review are as follows. 
? Sentence level (SL) 
? The number of sentences in the review 
? The average length of sentences  
? The number of sentences with product features 
? Word level (WL) 
? The number of words in the review 
? The number of products (e.g., DMC-FZ50, 
EX-Z1000) in the review 
? The number of products in the title of a review  
? The number of brand names (e.g., Canon, Sony) 
in the review  
? The number of brand names in the title of a 
review 
? Product feature level (PFL) 
? The number of product features in the review 
? The total frequency of product features in the 
review 
? The average frequency of product features in 
the review 
? The number of product features in the title of a 
review 
?  The total frequency of product features in the 
title of a review 
4.3.2 Features on Readability 
We make use of several features at paragraph level 
which indicate the underlying structure of the 
reviews.  These features include, 
? The number of paragraphs in the review 
? The average length of paragraphs in the review 
? The number of paragraph separators in the re-
view 
Here, we refer to the keywords, such as ?Pros? 
vs. ?Cons? as ?paragraph separators?. The key-
words usually appear at the beginning of para-
graphs for categorizing two contrasting aspects of 
a product. We extract the nouns and noun phrases 
at the beginning of each paragraph from the 4,909 
reviews and use the most frequent 30 pairs of key-
words as paragraph separators. Table 2 provides 
some examples of the extracted separators. 
Separators Separators 
Positive Negative Positive Negative 
Pros Cons The Good The Bad 
Strength Weakness Thumb up Bummer 
PLUSES MINUSES Positive Negative 
Advantages Drawbacks Likes Dislikes 
The  upsides Downsides 
GOOD 
THINGS 
BAD 
THINGS 
Table 2. Examples of paragraph separators 
339
4.3.3 Features on Subjectiveness 
We also take the subjectiveness of reviews into 
consideration. Unlike previous work (Kim et al 
2006; Zhang and Varadarajan, 2006) using shallow 
syntactic information directly, we use a sentiment 
analysis tool (Hu and Liu, 2004) which aggregates 
a set of shallow syntactic information. The tool is a 
classifier capable of determining the sentiment 
polarity of each sentence. We create three learning 
features regarding the subjectiveness of reviews. 
? The percentage of positive sentences in the 
review 
? The percentage of negative sentences in the 
review 
? The percentage of subjective sentences (re-
gardless of positive or negative) in the review 
5 Experiments 
In this section, we describe our experiments with 
the proposed classification-based approach to low-
quality review detection, and its effectiveness on 
the task of opinion summarization. 
5.1 Detecting Low-quality Reviews 
In our proposed approach, the problem of assessing 
quality of reviews is formalized as a binary classi-
fication problem. We conduct experiments by tak-
ing reviews in the categories of ?best?, ?good?, and 
?fair? as high-quality reviews and those in the 
?bad? category as low-quality reviews.  
As for classification model, we utilize the 
SVMLight toolkit (Joachims, 2004). We randomly 
divide the 100 queries of digital cameras into two 
sets, namely a training set of 50 queries and a test 
set of 50 queries. For the two copies of annota-
tions, we use the same division. We use the train-
ing set from ?annotation 1? to train the model and 
apply the model to the test sets from both ?annota-
tion 1? and ?annotation 2?, respectively. Table 3 
reports the accuracies of our approach to review 
classification. The accuracy is defined as the per-
centage of correctly classified reviews. 
We take the approach that utilizes only the cate-
gory of features on sentence level (SL) as the base-
line, and incrementally add other categories of fea-
tures on informativeness, readability and subjec-
tiveness. We can see that both the features on word 
level (WL) and those on product feature level (PFL) 
can improve the performance of classification 
much. The features on readability can still increase 
the accuracy although the contribution is much 
less. The features on subjectiveness, however, 
make no contribution.   
 
Feature Category Annotation1 Annotation2 
Informative-
ness  
SL 73.59% 72.81% 
WL 80.41% 79.15% 
PFL 83.30% 82.37% 
Readability 83.93% 82.91% 
Subjectiveness 83.84% 82.96% 
Table 3. Low-quality reviews detection 
We also conduct a more detailed analysis on 
each individual feature. Two categories of features 
on ?title? and ?brand name? have poor perfor-
mance, which is due to the lack of information in 
the title and the low coverage of brand names in a 
review, respectively. 
5.2 Summarizing Sentiments of Reviews 
One potential application of low-quality review 
detection is the opinion summarization of reviews.  
The process of opinion summarization of re-
views with regards to a query of a product consists 
of the following steps (Liu et al 2005): 
1. From each of the reviews, identify every text 
segment with opinion in the review, and de-
termine the polarities of the opinion segments. 
2. For each product feature, generate a positive 
opinion set and a negative opinion set of opi-
nion segments, denoted as POS(?) 
and NOS(?). 
3. For each product feature, aggregate the num-
bers of segments in POS(?)  andNOS(?) , as 
opinion summarization on the product feature. 
In this process, all the reviews contribute the 
same. However, different reviews do hold different 
authorities. A positive/negative opinion from a 
high-quality review should not have the same 
weight as that from a low-quality review.  
We use a two-stage approach to enhance the re-
liability of summarization. That is, we add a 
process of low-quality review detection before the 
summarization process, so that the summarization 
result is obtained based on the high-quality reviews 
only. We are to demonstrate how much difference 
the proposed two-stage approach can bring into the 
opinion summarization. 
We use the best classification model trained as 
described in Section 5.1 to filter low-quality re-
views, and do summarization on the high-quality 
340
reviews associated to the 50 test queries. We de-
note the proposed approach and the old approach 
as ?two-stage? and ?one-stage?, respectively. Due 
to the limited space, we only give a visual compar-
ison of the two approaches on ?image quality? in 
Figure 6. The upper figure shows the summariza-
tion of positive opinions and the lower figure 
shows that of negative opinions. From the figures 
we can see that the two-stage approach preserves 
fewer text segments as the result of filtering out 
many low-quality product reviews. 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Summarization on ?image quality? 
To show the comparison on more features in a 
compressed space, we give the statistic ratio of 
change between two approaches instead. As for the 
evaluation measure, we define ?RatioOfChange? 
(ROC) on a feature f as, 
 
ROC ? =
Rateone?stage  ? ? Ratetwo?stage (?)
Rateone?stage (?)
 (3) 
 
where Rate *(f) is defined as, 
  
Rate?(?) =
|POS(?)|
|POS(?)| + |NOS(?)|
 (4) 
 
Table 4 shows some statistic results on ROC on 
five product features, namely ?image quality?(IQ), 
?battery?, ?LCD screen? (LCD), ?flash? and ?mov-
ie mode? (MM). The values in the cells are the 
percentage of queries whose ROC is larger/smaller 
than the respective thresholds. We can see that a 
large portion of queries have big changes on the 
values of ROC. This means that the result achieved 
by the two-stage approach is substantially different 
from that achieved by the one-stage approach.

RatioOfChange (+) 
>0.30 >0.25 >0.20 >0.15 >0.10 >0.05

Flash  6% 10% 16% 20% 26% 42%

%Query

LCD  4% 4% 8% 12% 22% 28% 
Flash  4% 6% 8% 16% 18% 28% 
MM 8% 10% 16% 18% 34% 42% 
Table 4. RatioOfChange on five features 
There is no standard way to evaluate the quality 
of opinion summarization as it is rather a subjec-
tive problem. In order to demonstrate the impact of 
the two-stage approach, we turn to external author-
itative sources other than Amazon.com as the ob-
jective evaluation reference. We observe that 
CNET2 provides a professional ?editor?s review? 
for many products, which gives a rating in the 
range of 1~10 on product features. 9 digital cam-
eras out of the 50 test queries are found to have the 
editor?s rating on ?image quality? at CNET. We 
use this rating to compare with the results of our 
opinion summarization. We rescale the Rate scores 
obtained by both the one-stage approach and the 
two-stage approach into the range of 1-10 in order 
to perform the comparison.  
Figure 7 provides the visual comparison. We 
can see that the result achieved by the two-stage 
approach has a much better (closer) resemblance to 
CNET rating than one-stage approach does. This 
indicates that our two-stage approach can achieve a 
more consistent summarization result to the profes-
sional evaluations by the editors. Although the 
CNET rating is not the absolute standard for prod-
uct evaluation, it provides a professional yet objec-
tive evaluation of the products. Therefore, the ex-
perimental results demonstrate that our proposed 
approach could achieve more reliable opinion 
summarization which is closer to the generic eval-
uation from authoritative sources.

6 Conclusion 
In this paper, we studied the problem of detecting 
low-quality product reviews. Our contribution can 
be summarized in two-fold: (1) we discovered 
three types of biases in the ground-truth used ex-
tensively in the existing work, and proposed a spe-
cification on the quality of product reviews. The 
three biases that we discovered are imbalance vote 
bias, winner circle bias, and early bird bias. (2) 
Rooting on the new ground-truth (conforming to 
the proposed specification), we proposed a classi-
fication-based approach to low-quality product 
review detection, which yields better performance 
of opinion summarization. 
We hope to explore our future work in several 
areas, such as further consolidating the new 
ground-truth from different points of view and ve-
rifying the effectiveness of low-quality review de-
tection with other applications.
