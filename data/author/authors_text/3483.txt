ABSTRACT 
AT&T Communicator is a state-of-the-art speech-enabled 
telephony-based application that allows the end-user to, among 
other things, select and reserve airline itineraries.  This 
experiment explores how the amount and structure of information 
presented in complex lists influences the user experience and the 
ability of subjects to successfully complete a selection task.  
Presenting all the relevant information needed for a decision at 
once was the factor that most positively influenced successful task 
completion and the user experience.  Subjects preferred hearing 
all of the relevant information about each flight, without initiating 
additional dialog with the system.  Additionally, successful task 
completion rates improved when all of the flights were presented 
at once, without any intervening questions from the system.

1. INTRODUCTION 
AT&T Communicator is a state-of-the-art spoken dialogue system 
that allows the end-user to select and reserve various travel related 
resources, in particular, airfare, hotel, and rental cars [2].  One of 
its most challenging dialog modules is that for presenting 
information that allows the user to select a desired air travel 
itinerary. While selecting between multiple possible itineraries in 
a visual domain is a relatively simple task because most of the 
selection criteria are listed in a single scrollable page, the same 
task is likely to have a much higher cognitive load in an audio-
only domain [1, 3]. The selection criteria for each candidate flight 
must be presented to the user serially, leading to higher cognitive 
demands that could result in errors in itinerary selection.     
A sample AT&T Communicator dialog with the prototype 
used in this experiment, showing the outbound flight only, 
follows. 
System: Hello, this is AT&T Communicator.   
How may I help with your travel plans? 
User:   Yeah, I?d like to fly from Newark to San Francisco. 
System: OK, a flight from Newark, New Jersey to San 
Francisco, California.  And will this be a round 
trip? 
User:   Yes, and I need to arrive in San Francisco by 4 PM 
on November 22nd. 
System: I found five outbound United Airlines flights.   
Option 1 is flight number 635.  It has one stop; it 
departs at 10:15 A.M. and arrives at 2:42 P.M. 
<pause>   
Option 2 is flight number 7535.  It has one stop; It 
departs at 12:20 P.M., and arrives at 4:37 P.M.  
<pause>   
Option 3 is flight number 837.  It' s a non-stop 
flight; it departs at 2:00 P.M.  and arrives at 5:01 
P.M.  <pause>   
Would you like to hold any of these flights? 
 
 
 
User:   I guess I?ll take option one. 
System: Got it.   
Note that the second to the last system utterance, in which a 
set of itineraries are presented to the user for selection, is by far 
the longest system utterance in the dialog.  This utterance 
includes a complex list of information.  Unlike a more simple list, 
each list item (option) contains a number of sub-items, for 
example flight number, number of stops, etc.  In early dialog 
evaluations of the Communicator system, the selection of a single 
itinerary from such a complex list of flights was a source of 
substantial usability problems; users frequently became frustrated.  
In fact, many users dropped out of the dialog before successfully 
selecting an itinerary.   
This paper describes an experiment in which we vary the 
amount and structure of information presented about available 
itineraries.  We predict that the amount and structure of 
information presented affects the ability of users to successfully 
select the optimal itinerary within a set, and influences subjective 
measures such as user satisfaction. 
2. METHODS AND PROCEDURES 
2.1 Subjects 
Sixty-four subjects were run at a local shopping mall over a five 
day period.  Subjects were recruited from the shoppers 
frequenting the mall. 
2.2 Wizard of Oz 
A Wizard of Oz (WOZ) experiment was run to determine the 
optimal way for the end-user to select a desired itinerary in the 
Communicator project. 
A Wizard of Oz experiment is one in which no real automatic 
speech recognition (ASR) or natural language understanding 
(NLU) is used.  Instead, the user interface is prototyped and a 
?wizard,? or experimenter, acts in place of the ASR and NLU.  
Consequently, subjects believe that ASR/NLU is being used.  The 
WOZ methodology allows competing user interface strategies to 
be prototyped and tested with end users in a shorter period of time 
than would be required to implement multiple fully-functioning 
systems with competing user interfaces. 
2.3 Apparatus & Materials 
Relevant aspects of the AT&T Communicator user interface were 
prototyped using the Unisys Natural Language Speech Assistant 
(NLSA) software.  NLSA runs on a PC using the Windows NT 
operating system.  Subjects called into the Communicator 
prototype using an analog telephone and interacted with the 
system by voice.  The wizard categorized the subject?s speech 
using the NLSA Wizard graphical user interface (GUI).  Each 
subject completed 5 surveys in pen and paper format.  During the 
course of the experiment, subjects also had access to a pad of 
paper. 
2.4 Experimental Design 
All itineraries presented to the subjects were round-trip. 
2.4.1 Independent Variables 
This was a factorial experiment with two factors, one factor 
between subjects and the other within subject (see Table 1). 
Selection Itinerary Content.
  There were two levels of this 
between subjects factor: 
--Terse.  The presented itineraries included:  airline, number 
of stops, and departure time1.  In order to get additional 
information, the user could ask the system questions (e.g. 
?When does that flight arrive??). 
--Verbose.  The presented itineraries included:  airline, flight 
number, number of stops, departure time, and arrival time.  
All the information relevant to the tasks specified in the 
experiment are presented about each flight; the user did not 
need to ask questions to get additional information. 
Number of Flights Before Question.
  Each level is actually a 
combination of two separate, but related, factors. 
--Combined vs. Separate.  Whether outbound and return 
flights are presented separately or in combination.  
--Number of flights.  The number of flights that are presented 
before asking the subject to make a decision. 
Four levels of this factor were chosen.  In all cases (1) the 
total number of flights ?found? was 5, and, (2) the question was, 
?Would you like to hold [that flight/any of  those flights]??. 
--Separate 1.  The outbound and return flights of the trip are 
presented separately and after each flight the subject is asked 
the question. 
--Separate 3.  The outbound and return flights of the trip are 
presented separately and after the third flight the subject is 
asked the question. 
--Separate 5.  The outbound and return flights of the trip are 
presented separately and after the last flight the subject is 
asked the question.   
--Combined.  The outbound and return flights of the trip are 
presented at the same time and after each set of two flights 
the subject is asked the question.

  The following example could have been used in 
the Separate 3 condition.  Text that is unformatted is common to 
both the terse and verbose conditions.  Text in italics is found 
only in the verbose condition. 
?I found 5 outbound Delta flights. Option 1 is
 flight number 
323.  It?s a non-stop leaving at 9:10 and arriving at 2:01.   
Option 2
 is flight number 798.  It has one stop; it departs at 
11:13 and arrives at 5:07. Option 3 is flight number 295.  It

you like to hold any of those flights?? 
2.4.2 Mixed Initiative and Flow of Control 
The dialog strategy was mixed initiative.  The first prompt was 
open-ended, e.g. ?How may I help you with your travel plans??  
All subsequent prompts requested specific information from the 
user (e.g. ?What date did you want to depart??)  The prototypes 
were built to allow the user to provide multiple informational 
elements (e.g. departure city and departure date) to either open-
ended or specific requests.  Subsequent steps in the flow of 
control could be skipped if multiple pieces of information were 
presented at a single dialog point. 
2.4.3 Tasks 
Each subject was asked to complete four tasks in the course of 
this experiment.  In each task the subject was given a set of 
criteria that the subject had to meet in selecting both an outbound 
and a return flight.  The tasks used in this experiment exercise 
selection criteria that are representative of selection criteria 
typically used by individuals actually purchasing airline tickets.  
The four tasks given to subjects follow: 
Departure Only.  The task criteria for both the outbound and 
return flights require the subject to choose flights based on 
departure time only.  
Arrival Only.  The task criteria for both the outbound and return 
flights require the subject to choose flights based on arrival time 
only. 
Departure & Arrival.   The task criteria require the subject to 
choose the outbound flight based on departure time and the return 
flight based on arrival time. 
Specific Flight.  The task requires the subject to book a particular 
flight for both the outbound and return flights. 
Example.  The following example was used for the Departure 
& Arrival task (it has been edited for presentation here). 
You want a round trip ticket from Boston to Charleston.  
You want to leave Boston about 5 in the evening of 
Friday November 10th.  You want to arrive in Boston no 
later than 8 PM on Tuesday November 14th. 
An important selection criterion for many purchasers of 
airline tickets is price.  The price of the ticket was not a selection 
criterion used in this experiment because it would introduce 
possible confounds.  Many users are willing to trade-off other 
important selection criteria, e.g. arrival time and departure time, 
in order to minimize price.  Therefore, it was decided, a priori, to 
postpone the use of price as a selection criterion to a later 
experiment. 
2.4.4 Counterbalancing 
A Balanced Greco-Latin Square was used to counterbalance the 
orders of the conditions and tasks. 
2.4.5 Dependent Measures 
A rich set of dependent measures were gathered in this 
experiment:   
-- After each system prompt was played, NLSA recorded what 
subjects said. 
-- At the end of each task, the wizard determined whether that 
task was successfully completed. 
-- At the end of each task, subjects completed paper and pen 
surveys rating the overall dialog for that task. 
-- After experiencing all four tasks, subjects told the 
experimenter which of the flight selection criteria were 
important to them. 
Objective measure.  Successful task completion was the one 
objective measure used in determining the optimal method for 
presenting complex lists in an audio-only domain.  For each task 
the subject was given a set of required criteria for selecting both 
the outbound and a return flight.  Task completion was binary, 
successful or unsuccessful, and was determined by the 
experimenter (wizard) at the time the subject completed each task.  
In order for a subject to successfully complete a task, the subject 
had to select both the outbound and return flight that best fit the 
clear criteria given to subjects in the task description. 
Subjective measures.  Other data gathered in this experiment 
included a number of subjective measures.  After each task, 
subjects were asked: 
Overall, how satisfied were you with AT&T Communicator while 
booking this flight?  
[1] Very Satisfied  
[2] Somewhat Satisfied  
[3] Neither Satisfied, Nor Dissatisfied  
[4] Somewhat Dissatisfied  
[5] Very Dissatisfied  
Overall, how easy was it to use AT&T Communicator while 
booking this flight?  
[1] Very Easy  
[2] Somewhat Easy  
[3] Neither Easy, Nor Difficult  
[4] Somewhat Difficult  
[5] Very Difficult  
Overall, how quickly did AT&T Communicator respond to your 
speech?   
[1] Much Too Fast  
[2] A Little Too Fast  
[3] Just the Right Speed  
[4] A Little Too Slow  
[5] Much Too Slow  
After you told Communicator the date and time to book your 
flight, Communicator responded with possible flights to choose 
from. For EACH of the possible flights, did Communicator 
present the right amount of information?   
[1] Too Much Information about Each Flight  
[2] Just the Right Amount of Information About Each 
Flight  
[3] Too Little Information about Each Flight  
After completing all four tasks, subjects were asked to (1) 
rank order the criteria they personally use when selecting between 
multiple itineraries, and (2) specify the information that 
Communicator should present about every flight for selection 
purposes in the future. 
3. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS 
3.1 Terse or Verbose? 
A two-way, 2x4, Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was run for 
each of 5 dependent measures:  successful task completion, 
amount of information presented about each flight, satisfaction, 
ease of use, and speed of interaction.   For each dependent 
measure, no significant interactions were found2.  A significant 
main effect for Terse/Verbose was found for the subjective 
measure of the amount of information presented about each flight 
(p=.001), see Fig. 1.

No other significant main effects were found for any of the

measure amount of information is ?2? (Just the right amount of

condition (across the 4 levels of # of Flights) was 2.06, while the 
equivalent average for the Terse condition was 2.24.

Weighted Scores for all  subjects. 
Similarly, a second question was asked of all subjects at 
the end of the experiment:  ?In the future, what information

when you are choosing between multiple flights?? Figure 3

Information that should definitely be presented to subjects 
when selecting between multiple flights includes:  price, arrival 
time, departure time, number of stops and airline.    The value to 
users of the length of stops is ambiguous.  It probably should not 
be presented by default, although it might be useful to present the 
length of stops if they will be inordinately long, e.g. greater than 
2 hours, or inordinately short, e.g. less than 45 minutes.  Flight 
number was judged to be least valuable and should not be 
presented. 
3.2 Number of Flights? 
The above analyses indicate that the amount of information 
presented in the Verbose condition better met the expectations of 
subjects.   The next question then was, within the verbose 
condition, which level of the number of flights before the question 
factor showed the best performance.  A one-way, 1x4, ANOVA 
was run for the verbose condition for each of five dependent 
measures:  successful task completion, amount of information 
about each flight, satisfaction, ease of use, and speed of 
interaction3.  A significant main effect was found for successful

 As noted at the beginning of the Results section, subject responses to the 
satisfaction, ease of use, and speed of the interaction questions may be 
attributable to the subject?s reactions to the novel user-system 
task completion (p=.005).  Figure 4 shows the percentage of 
successful task completions in the Verbose condition only.  No 
significant effects were found for the other four dependent 
measures.

Separate 5 was the condition with the highest successful task

(p<.05).  Tasks attempted in the Separate 5 condition were 
significantly more likely to be completed successfully than tasks 
attempted in the Separate 3 condition.

Among the three Separate conditions (Separate 1, Separate 3, 
and Separate 5), subjects were much more likely to successfully 
complete a task in Separate 5.  That is, when all the flights for a 
given flight (outbound or return) were presented at once, without 
any intervening questions. Also, based on subject comments, it 
appeared that at least some subjects in the Separate 3 condition 
were confused about the number of flights they had available to 
select between.  These subjects didn?t realize that there were more 
flights available after the system presented them with the first

three in a total set of five flights.  This is in spite of the fact that in 
all tasks, including the Separate 3 condition, the subjects heard a 
sentence like ?I found five outbound Northwest Airlines flights,? 
before the options were presented for selection.   
It not possible, on the basis of the experimental data gathered 
in this study, to unambiguously choose one of the # of flights 
before question conditions over the others.  It may be that a more 
difficult set of tasks would elicit stronger differences in both the 
objective and subjective measures for the levels of this factor.  
However, in absolute terms, the task completion rates with 
Separate 5 and Combined were both high (90% and 83%, 
respectively), relative to the Separate 1 and Separate 3 conditions 
(60% and 57%, respectively). 
Anecdotal evidence sheds some additional light on the issue 
of which condition (Separate 5 or Combined) is preferred by 
subjects.  In the Verbose condition, the last 17 subjects run in the 
experiment were asked a few questions that provide evidence 
concerning their subjective impressions of the four levels of the 
number of flights before question factor.  The first question was 
?Did you notice any difference between the different versions of 
the system??  Twelve of seventeen subjects stated that they had 
noticed a difference between the four versions.  Those 12 subjects 
were then asked to choose the version they liked the best, and 
then the version they considered to be the worst.   
Best?

Worst? 
7-Did not specify a ?worst? version 
5-Combined only

0-Separate 3 only

In response to the question of which version of the system 
was best, the subjects stated no consistent preference for any of 
the versions of the system.  On the other hand, the responses to 
the question concerning which version of the system was ?worst? 
resulted in a more consistent set of responses; the Combined 
version was selected by 5 of 12 of the subjects as the version they 
considered to be the ?worst.?  From subject comments, it appeared 
that subjects didn?t like it when they heard one flight that matched 
their constraints (e.g. outbound), while the other flight did not 
match their constraints (e.g. return).  Some subjects found this to 
be frustrating, confusing, and/or tedious. 
4. DISCUSSION 
Presenting all the relevant information about a given flight at once 
seemed to be the single overarching factor that most positively 
influenced successful task completion and the user experience.  
Subjects wanted to hear all of the relevant information about a 
flight needed to make the best choice.    
Within the Separate conditions (Separate 1, Separate 3 and 
Separate 5), the task completion rate was highest for the Separate 
5 condition.  That is, when all of the flights were presented at 
once, without any intervening system questions. The Separate 5 
and Combined conditions had similar task completion rates and 
were not significantly different.  However, the Combined 
condition was the only condition considered ?worst? by subjects. 
Thus, the condition that maximized both successful task 
completion and user experience was the Verbose Separate 5 
condition.   
A major concern in the design of this experiment was that the 
audio presentation of lists of complex information, in this case 
lists of multiple airline flights each containing multiple pieces of 
information, would result in cognitive overload.  These findings 
argue that, for this task, our concern about the increased cognitive 
load in an audio-only domain was unfounded.  There are a couple 
of possible reasons that cognitive load did not appear to have the 
influence that we anticipated.  First, users knew their constraints 
when listening to the flights.  Some users may have used a 
strategy of only remembering the options that potentially matched 
their constraints.  Second, many subjects apparently dealt with the 
increased cognitive load by taking notes, with flight times, etc., 
while completing the experimental tasks.  Such behaviour is 
certainly common when making airline reservations with a human 
travel agent over the telephone.  Further, it is anticipated that 
users would generally book flights in a hands-free environment, 
and would be able to take notes, when it is desirable.  Although 
less ecologically valid, future experiments primarily concerned 
with the issue of cognitive load should explicitly preclude 
subjects from taking notes. 
From the above data, it appears that the standard user 
interface practices for Prompt & Collect (in which the system 
?prompts? the user for a specific piece of information and then 
?collects? their response) should be different than the standard 
practice for Selecting from a List.  For Prompt & Collect, the 
standard UI practice is for the system to be as terse as possible 
when prompting the user.  The user generally knows the 
information the system is asking for, they just need to be 
prompted so that they know what piece of information the system 
is currently ready to accept.  When Selecting from a List, 
however, the level of knowledge of the system and user are very 
different.  The system knows the possible items that can be 
selected.  The user begins the interaction only knowing their own 
constraints (and their relative priority).  The system must present 
all the relevant information so that the user can select the optimal 
item from the list based on their constraints and priorities.  
Consequently, when the user must select an item from a list, the 
system should be as verbose as necessary and present all the 
information relevant to their decision at once. 
For the task of selecting between multiple airline flights, the 
following information should definitely be presented to users 
about each flight: price, arrival time, departure time, number of 
stops and airline.  While there was agreement between subjects on 
the important selection criteria for flights, there are also some 
individual differences.  For example, some users like to fly only a 
particular airline or have strong preferences concerning the 
locations of layovers.  This experiment indicates that users like to 
hear all of the information relevant to their decision at once.  
Therefore, if a user asks a question concerning information that is 
not by default presented by the system about each flight, the 
information presented to that user for each subsequent flight on 
that call, should include the information they have requested.  For 
example, if after the first flight the user asks ?Where does that 
flight stop??, the information for all subsequent flights in that call 
should include the location of any stops. 
It thus appears likely that subjects in this experiment were 
using AT&T Communicator as a tool, rather than as a 
conversational or negotiating partner.  That is, their goal was to 
use Communicator to quickly and efficiently select the single 
flight that best matched the criteria given to them in each task.  
Asking the system questions in order to get information relevant 
to this selection process, would decrease the speed and efficiency 
with which they were able to accomplish this task.  So, subjects 
preferred the most verbose presentation of information in order to 
increase the speed and efficiency of the overall task. 
Nevertheless, eighty percent of the subjects stated that the 
most important criterion when personally selecting a flight was 
price.   A number of subjects commented that they were willing to 
trade off other important criterion, e.g. airline, number of stops, in 
order to get a better price.  In a more complex selection task, 
where the user is choosing a set of flights based on multiple, 
competing selection criteria, the user may wish to use AT&T 
Communicator as a negotiating partner in order to get the best 
flight available.  Such a negotiation might lend itself well to 
exploring machine-user dialog in a natural language telephony-
based system.
