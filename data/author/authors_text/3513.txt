Abstract
Named entity (NE) recognition is an impor-
tant task for many natural language applica-
tions, such as Internet search engines,
document indexing, information extraction
and machine translation. Moreover, in ori-
ental languages (such as Chinese, Japanese
and Korean), NE recognition is even more
important because it significantly affects the
performance of word segmentation, the most
fundamental task for understanding the texts
in oriental languages. In this paper, a prob-
abilistic verification model is designed for
verifying the correctness of a named entity
candidate. This model assesses the confi-
dence level of a candidate not only accord-
ing to the candidate?s structure but also ac-
cording to its context. In our design, the
clues for confidence measurement are col-
lected from both positive and negative ex-
amples in the training data in a statistical
manner. Experimental results show that the
proposed method significantly improves the
F-measure of Chinese personal name recog-
nition from 86.5% to 94.4%.
Introduction
Named entity (NE) recognition (or proper name
recognition) is a task to find the entities of per-
son, location, organization, date, time, percent-
age and monetary value in text documents. It is
an important task for many natural language
applications, such as Internet search engines,
document indexing, information extraction and
machine translation. Moreover, in oriental lan-
guages (such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean),
NE recognition is even more important because
it significantly affects the performance of word
segmentation, the most fundamental task for
understanding the texts in oriental languages.
Therefore, a high-accuracy NE recognition
method is highly demanded for most natural
language applications in various languages.
There are two major approaches to NE
recognition: the handcrafted approach (Grish-
man, 1995) and the statistical approach (Bikel,
1997; Chen, 1998; Yu, 1998). In the first ap-
proach, a system usually relies on a large num-
ber of handcrafted rules. This kind of systems
can be rapid prototyped but are hard to scale up.
In fact, there will be numerous exceptions for
most handcrafted rules. It is generally expensive
and impossible to code for every exception we
can imagine, not to mention those exceptions we
are not able to think of. Another serious problem
with the handcrafted approach is that systems
are hard to be ported across different domains
and different languages. Porting a handcrafted
system usually means rewriting all its rules.
Therefore, the statistical approach is becoming
more and more popular because of its cost-
effectiveness in scaling up and porting systems.
In general, the statistical approach to NE
recognition can be viewed as a two-stage proc-
ess. First, according to dictionaries and/or pat-
tern matching rules, the input text is tokenized
into tokens. Each token may be a word or an NE
candidate which can consist of more than one
word. Then, the most likely token sequence is
selected according to a statistical model, such as
Markov model (Bikel, 1997; Yu, 1998) or
maximum entropy model (Borthwick, 1999).
Although, the statistical NE recognition is much
more scalable and portable, its performance is
still not satisfactory. The insufficient cover-
age/precision of pattern matching rules and
unknown words are the major sources of errors.
Furthermore, the role of the statistical model is
to assess the relative possibilities of all possible
token sequences and select the most probable
one. The scores obtained from the statistical
model can be used for a comparison of compet-
ing token sequences, but not for an assessment
of the probability that a spotted named entity is
correct.
To reduce the recognition errors, we pro-
pose a probabilistic verification model to verify
the correctness of a named entity. This model
assesses the confidence level of a named entity
candidate not only according to the candidate?s
structure but also according to its contexts. In
our design, the clues for confidence measure-
ment are collected from both positive and nega-
tive examples in the training data. Therefore, the
confidence measure has strong discriminant
power for judging the correctness of a named
entity. In the experiments of Chinese personal
name recognition, the proposed verification
model increases the F-measure from 86.5% to
94.4%, which corresponds to 58.5% error re-
duction rate, where ?error rate? is defined as
?100% F-measure? ?.
1. Named Entity Verification
As mentioned before, there are several kinds of
named entities, including person, location, or-
ganization, date, time, percentage and monetary
value. In the following description, we use the
task of verifying Chinese personal name as an
example. However, our proposed method is also
applicable on verifying other kinds of named
entities in different languages.
Before introducing our approach, we first
describe the notations that will be used. In this
proposal, a random variable is written with a
boldface italic letter. An outcome of a random
variable is written with the same italic letter but
in normal face. For example, an outcome of the
random variable o is denoted as o . If there is
no confusion, we usually use ( )P o to denote
the probability ( )P o=o . A symbol sequence
? 1, , nx x" ? is denoted as ? 1nx ?. Likewise, ? ,,1Y nYx ?
denotes the sequence ?
,1 ,, ,Y Y nx x" ?.
The task of verifying a named entity can-
didate is viewed as making an acceptance or
rejection decision according to the text segment
consisting of the candidate and its context.
Without loss of generality, a text segment is
considered as an outcome of the random vector
, , ,
,1 ,1 ,1[ , , ]L x C y R zL C R=O o o o . The outcome of each ran-
dom variable in O is one basic element of text.
In Chinese, the basic elements of text are Chine-
se characters. However, in English, the basic
elements are English words. Figure 1 shows an
example of a text segment in which the size of
the candidate to be verified is 3 (i.e., consists of
three Chinese characters) and the sizes of its left
context and right context are set to 2 (i.e., two
Chinese characters).
Figure 2 depicts the flowchart of our veri-
fication approach. First, the candidate in the
input text segment is parsed by a predefined
grammar. If the candidate is ill-formed (i.e., fail

to be parsed), it will be rejected immediately.
Otherwise, the text segment is passed to the
confidence measurement module to assess the
confidence level that the candidate in the text
segment is to be a named entity. If the confi-
dence measure is less than a predefined thresh-
old, the candidate will be rejected. Otherwise, it
will be accepted.
2. Confidence Measurement
The basic idea of our approach is to formulate
the confidence measurement problem as the
problem of hypothesis testing. The null hypothe-
sis 0H in which the candidate is a name is
tested against the alternative hypothesis 1H in
which the candidate is not a name. According to
Neyman-Pearson Lemma, an optimal hypothesis
test involves the evaluation of the following log
likelihood ratio:
, , ,
,1 ,1 ,1

,1 ,1 ,1 0

threshold ? . If , , ,
,1 ,1 ,1( , , )L x C y R zL C RLLR o o o ?? , the
null hypothesis will be accepted. Otherwise, it
will be rejected.
In our design, as shown in Figure 3, the
confidence measurement module consists of two
models, named NE model and anti-NE model.
The NE model is used to assess the value of
, , ,

is used to assess the value of

2.1. NE Model
The purpose of the NE model is to evaluate the
value of , , ,

lihood of the candidate and its left and right
contexts given the hypothesis that the candidate
is a name. Since it is infeasible to directly esti-
mate the probability , , ,

approximated as follows:

3. Experiment Setup
The proposed named entity verification method
is used to recognize Chinese personal names
from news. In Chinese, most of the personal
names consist of three Chinese characters. The
first character is a surname. The last two char-
acters are a given name. Therefore, our prelimi-
nary experiments are focused on recognizing the
personal names of three Chinese characters.
In our experiments, the training corpus
consists of about 14,339,000 Chinese characters
collected from economy and industry news. This
corpus should be annotated to estimate the prob-
abilistic parameters of the scoring functions
NE ( )S ? and anti-NE ( )S ? . However, labeling such
large amount of data is too costly or prohibited
even if it is possible. Therefore, labeling

methods that can be bootstrapped from a little
seed data or a few seed rules (Collins, 1999;
Cucerzan, 1999) are highly demanded to auto-
matically annotate the training data. In the fol-
lowing section, we propose an EM-style boot-
strapping procedure (Cucerzan, 1999) for anno-
tating the training data automatically.
3.1. EM-Style Bootstrapping
The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm
(Moon, 1996) has been widely used to estimate
model parameters from incomplete data in many
different applications. In this section, an EM-
style bootstrapping procedure is proposed to
automatically annotate the named entities in the
training corpus. It iteratively uses the proposed
verification model to label the training corpus
(expectation step), and then uses the labeled
training corpus to re-estimate the parameters of
the verification model (maximization step).
Figure 5 shows the flowchart of the bootstrap-
ping procedure. First, we collect the names of
541 famous people, including government offi-
cers and CEOs of big companies. These names
are used as seed names of the name corpus.
Then, the news is automatically annotated ac-
cording to the name corpus. The annotated cor-
pus is used to estimate the probabilistic
parameters of the scoring functions. Afterward,
the proposed verification procedure is used to
verify every possible name candidate in the
news. The candidates whose confidence meas-
ures are larger than a predefined threshold are
determined to be names. Currently, if the confi-
dence measures of two overlapped candidates
(such as ?ma ying jiu? and ?ying jiu biao? in
Figure 1) pass the threshold, both of them are
determined as names. Although this strategy is
inadequate, it does not make too much trouble
because the chance to get overlapped names is
very small in our experiments. Finally, these
guessed names are added to the name corpus
which will be used to annotate the news in next
iteration.
In our case, after four iterations, the size
of name corpus is enlarged from 541 to 6,296, as
shown in Table 1. The total occurrence frequen-
cy of these 6,296 names in the training corpus is
40,345.
3.2. Baseline Model
In the past, many researchers have studied the
problem of Chinese personal name recognition.
Chang (1994) used the 0-order Markov model to
segment a text into words, including Chinese
personal names. In his approach, a name prob-
ability model is proposed to estimate the prob-
abilities of Chinese personal names. Sproat
(1994) proposed to recognize Chinese personal
names with the stochastic finite-state word seg-
mentation algorithm. His approach is similar to
Chang?s, except that the name probability model
is slightly different. In addition to name prob-
ability, Chen (1998) also add extra scores to a
name candidate according to context clues (such
as position, title, speech-act verbs). In the re-
searches mentioned above, the reported F-
measure performances on recognizing Chinese
personal names are somewhere between 70%
and 86%. Since these performances are meas-

ured based on different data, higher reported
performance does not imply better. In fact, the
name probability models used in these re-
searches are very similar. Their performances
should be comparable to each other. Therefore,
in this paper, Chang?s approach, whose reported
F-measure is 86%, is chosen as the baseline
model.
The baseline model is additionally
equipped with a dictionary of 72,333 Chinese
words. The prior probabilities of words are esti-
mated from Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus,
which contains about 2 million Chinese words.
4. Experimental Results and Discussions
Both the baseline model and the proposed name
entity verification model (named NEV model)
are tested on the same testing corpus. The testing
corpus, also collected from economy and indus-
try news, consists of about 737,000 characters.
This corpus is annotated manually and contains
totally 2,545 Chinese personal names.
The F-measure of the baseline model is
86.5% (as indicated by the dashed line in Figure
6). The precision and recall rates of the baseline
model are 79.1% and 95.5% respectively. Alt-
hough the recall rate of the baseline model is
high, the precision rate is pretty low. Over 20%
of the name candidates proposed by the baseline
model are incorrect.
In our experiments, the sizes of the left-
and right-context windows of the NEV model
are set to 2. In Figure 6, the solid line with trian-
gle markers depicts the F-measure of the NEV
model versus the iteration number of bootstrap-
ping. The F-measure saturates after 3 iterations.
After 4 iterations, the F-measure of the NEV
model reaches 94.4%. The corresponding preci-
sion and recall rates are 96.4% and 92.5% re-
spectively. Compared with the baseline model,
the precision rate is greatly improved from
79.1% to 96.4% with a little sacrifice in recall
rate. The F-measure is improved from 86.5% to
94.4%, which corresponds to 58.5% error re-
duction rate, where ?error rate? is defined as
?100% F-measure? ?.
Table 2 lists three examples of the mis-
recognized names made by the baseline model.
These examples clearly show that the baseline
model tends to incorrectly group consecutive
single characters, either from unknown words or
single-character words, into names. In the first
two examples, the single characters come from
the unknown location name ?(ga luo
lai na; Carolina) and the unknown company
name ?(luo ji; Logitech)?. The single char-
acters in the last example are single-character
words ?	(gi; quarter)?, ?
(quan; all)? and ?
(mei; USA)?.
Without the inadequate strong tendency of
grouping single characters, the NEV model is
able to avoid the misrecognition errors made by
the baseline model. The NEV model assesses the
confidence measure of each name candidate
according to the context around the candidate. In
Table 2, the name candidates in the shaded
boxes are rejected by the NEV model because
