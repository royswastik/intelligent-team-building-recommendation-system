Abstract
This paper discusses ensembles of simple but het-
erogeneous classifiers for word-sense disambigua-
tion, examining the Stanford-CS224N system en-
tered in the SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sample
task. First-order classifiers are combined by a
second-order classifier, which variously uses ma-
jority voting, weighted voting, or a maximum en-
tropy model. While individual first-order classifiers
perform comparably to middle-scoring teams? sys-
tems, the combination achieves high performance.
We discuss trade-offs and empirical performance.
Finally, we present an analysis of the combination,
examining how ensemble performance depends on
error independence and task difficulty.
1 Introduction
The problem of supervised word sense disambigua-
tion (WSD) has been approached using many differ-
ent classification algorithms, including naive-Bayes,
decision trees, decision lists, and memory-based
learners. While it is unquestionable that certain al-
gorithms are better suited to the WSD problem than
others (for a comparison, see Mooney (1996)), it
seems that, given similar input features, various al-
gorithms exhibit roughly similar accuracies.1 This
was supported by the SENSEVAL-2 results, where a

large fraction of systems had scores clustered in a
fairly narrow region (Senseval-2, 2001).
We began building our system with 23 supervised
WSD systems, each submitted by a student taking
the natural language processing course (CS224N) at
Stanford University in Spring 2000. Students were
free to implement whatever WSD method they chose.
While most implemented variants of naive-Bayes,
others implemented a range of other methods, in-
cluding n-gram models, vector space models, and
memory-based learners. Taken individually, the best
of these systems would have turned in an accuracy
of 61.2% in the SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sam-
ple task (which would have given it 6th place), while
others would have produced middling to low perfor-
mance. In this paper, we investigate how these clas-
sifiers behave in combination.
In section 2, we discuss the first-order classifiers
and describe our methods of combination. In sec-
tion 3, we discuss performance, analyzing what ben-
efit was found from combination, and when. We also
discuss aspects of the component systems which
substantially influenced overall performance.
2 The System
2.1 Training Procedure
Figure 1 shows the high-level organization of our
system. Individual first-order classifiers each map
lists of context word tokens to word-sense predic-
tions, and are self-contained WSD systems. The first-
order classifiers are combined in a variety of ways
with second-order classifiers. Second-order classi-
fiers are selectors, taking a list of first-order out-

puts and choosing from among them. An outline
of the classifier construction process is given in ta-
ble 1. First, the training data was split into training
and held-out sets for each word. This was done us-
ing 5 random bootstrap splits. Each split allocated
75% of the examples to training and 25% to held-
out testing.2 Held-out data was used both to select
the subsets of first-order classifiers to be combined,
and to select the combination methods.
For each word and each training split, the 23 first-
order classifiers were (independently) trained and
tested on held-out data. For each word, the first-
order classifiers were ranked by their average per-
formance on the held-out data, with the most accu-
rate classifiers at the top of the rankings. Ties were
broken by the classifiers? (weighted) average perfo-
mance across all words.
For each word, we then constructed a set of can-
2Bootstrap splits were used rather than standard n-fold
cross-validation for two reasons. First, it allowed us to gen-
erate an arbitrary number of training/held-out pairs while still
leaving substantial held-out data set sizes. Second, this ap-
proach is commonly used in the literature on ensembles. Its
well-foundedness and theoretical properties are discussed in
Breiman (1996). In retrospect, since we did not take proper ad-
vantage of the ability to generate numerous splits, it might have
been just as well to use cross-validation.
didate second-order classifiers. Second-order clas-
sifier types were identified by an ensemble size k
and a combination method m. One instance of each
second-order type was constructed for each word.
We originally considered ensemble sizes k in the
range {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15}. For a second-order
classifier with ensemble size k, the ensemble mem-
bers were the top k first-order classifiers according
to the local rank described above.
We combined first-order ensembles using one of
three methods m:
? Majority voting: The sense output by the most
first-order classifiers in the ensemble was chosen.
Ties were broken by sense frequency, in favor of
more frequent senses.
? Weighted voting: Each first-order classifier was
assigned a voting weight (see below). The sense
receiving the greatest total weighted vote was
chosen.
? Maximum entropy: A maximum entropy classifier
was trained (see below) and run on the outputs of
the first-order classifiers.
We considered all pairs of k and m, and so for
each word there were 24 possible second-order clas-
sifiers, though for k = 1 all three values of m are
equivalent and were merged. The k = 1 ensemble,
as well as the larger ensembles (k ? {9, 11, 13, 15}),
did not help performance once we had good first-
order classifier rankings (see section 3.4).
For m = Majority, there are no parameters to set.
For the other two methods, we set the parameters of
the (k, m) second-order classifier for a word w using
the bootstrap splits of the training data for w.
In the same manner as for the first-order classi-
fiers, we then ranked the second-order classifiers.
For each word, there was the local ranking of the
second-order classifiers, given by their (average) ac-
curacy on held-out data. Ties in these rankings were
broken by the average performance of the classifier
type across all words. The top second-order classi-
fier for each word was selected from these tie-broken
rankings.
At this point, all first-order ensemble members
and chosen second-order combination methods were
retrained on the unsplit training data and run on the
final test data.
It is important to stress that each target word was
considered an entirely separate task, and different
first- and second-order choices could be, and were,
made for each word (see the discussion of table 2
below). Aggregate performance across words was
only used for tie-breaking.
2.2 Combination Methods
Our second-order classifiers take training instances
of the form s? = (s, s1, . . . , sk) where s is the correct
sense and each si is the sense chosen by classifier i .
All three of the combination schemes which we used
can be seen as weighted voting, with different ways
of estimating the voting weights ?i of the first-order
voters. In the simplest case, majority voting, we skip
any attempt at statistical estimation and simply set
each ?i to be 1/k.
For the method we actually call ?weighted vot-
ing,? we view the combination output as a mixture
model in which each first-order system is a mixture
component:
P(s|s1, . . . , sk) =
?
i
?i P(s|si )
The conditional probabilties P(s|si ) assign mass
one to the sense si chosen by classifier i . The mix-
ture weights ?i were estimated using EM to max-
imize the likelihood of the second-order training
instances. In testing, the sense with the highest
weighted vote, and hence highest posterior likeli-
hood, is the selected sense.
For the maximum entropy classifier, we have a
different model for the chosen sense s. In this case,
it is an exponential model of the form:
P(s|s1, . . . , sk) =
exp
?
x ?x fx(s, s1, . . . , sk)
?
t exp
?
x ?x fx(t, s1, . . . , sk)
The features fx are functions which are true over
some subset of vectors s?. The original intent was to
design features to recognize and exploit ?sense ex-
pertise? in the individual classifiers. For example,
one classifier might be trustworthy when reporting
a certain sense but less so for other senses. How-
ever, there was not enough data to accurately esti-
mate parameters for such models.3 In fact, we no-

(classifier, chosen sense, correct sense) triple. However, most
senses are rarely chosen and rarely correct, so most features
had zero or singleton support.
ticed that, for certain words, simple majority voting
performed better than the maximum entropy model.
It also turned out that the most complex features we
could get value from were features of the form:
fi(s, s1, . . . , sk) = 1 ?? s = si
That is, for each first-order classifier, there is a sin-
gle feature which is true exactly when that classi-
fier is correct. With only these features, the maxi-
mum entropy approach also reduces to a weighted
vote; the s which maximizes the posterior probabil-
ity P(s|s1, . . . , sk) also maximizes the vote:
v(s) =
?
i ?i?(si = s)
The indicators ? are true for exactly one sense, and
correspond to the simple f i defined above.4 The
sense with the largest vote v(s) will be the sense
with the highest posterior probability P(s|s1, . . . sk)
and will be chosen.
For the maximum entropy classifier, we estimate
the weights by maximizing the likelihood of a held-
out set, using the standard IIS algorithm (Berger et
al., 1996). For both weighted schemes, we found
that stopping the iterative procedures before conver-
gence gave better results. IIS was halted after 50
rounds, while EM was halted after a single round.
Both methods were initialized to uniform starting
weights.
More importantly than changing the exact weight
estimates, moving from method to method triggers
broad qualitative changes in what kind of weights
are allowed. With majority voting, classifiers all
have equal, positive weights. With weighted vot-
ing, the weights are no longer required to be equal,
but are still non-negative. With maximum entropy
weighting, this non-negativity constraint is also re-
laxed, allowing classifiers? votes to actually reduce
the score for the sense that classifier has chosen.
Negative weights are in fact assigned quite fre-
quently, and often seem to have the effect of using
poor classifiers as ?error masks? to cancel out com-
mon errors.
As we move from majority voting to weighted
voting to maximum entropy, the estimation becomes

more sophisticated, but also more prone to overfit-
ting. Since solving the overfitting problem is hard,
while choosing between classifiers based on held-
out data is relatively easy, this spectrum gives us a
way to gracefully handle the range of sparsities in
the training corpora for different words.
2.3 Individual Classifiers
While our first-order classifiers implemented a va-
riety of classification algorithms, the differences in
their individual accuracies did not primarily stem
from the algorithm chosen. Rather, implementation
details led to the largest differences. For example,
naive-Bayes classifiers which chose sensible win-
dow sizes, or dynamically chose between window
sizes, tended to outperform those which chose poor
sizes. Generally, the optimal windows were either
of size one (for words with strong local syntactic or
collocational cues) or of very large size (which de-
tected more topical cues). Programs with hard-wired
window sizes of, say, 5, performed poorly. Iron-
ically, such middle-size windows were commonly
chosen by students, but rarely useful; either extreme
was a better design.5
Another implementation choice dramatically af-
fecting performance of naive-Bayes systems was the
amount and type of smoothing. Heavy smoothing
and smoothing which backed off conditional dis-
tributions P(w j |si) to the relevant marginal P(w j)
gave good results, while insufficient smoothing or
backing off to uniform marginals gave substantially
degraded results.6
There is one significant way in which our first-
order classifiers were likely different from other
teams? systems. In the original class project, stu-
dents were guaranteed that the ambiguous word
would appear only in a single orthographic form,
and many of the systems depended on the input sat-
isfying this guarantee. Since this was not true of
the SENSEVAL-2 data, we mapped the ambiguous
5Such window sizes were also apparently chosen by other
SENSEVAL-2 systems, which commonly used ?long distance?
and ?local? features, but defined local as a window size of 3?5
words on each side of the ambiguous word.
6In particular, there is a defective behavior with naive-Bayes
where, when one smooths far too little, the chosen sense is the
one which has occurred with the most words in the context
window. For small training sets of skewed-prior data like the
SENSEVAL-2 sets, this is invariably the common sense, regard-
less of the context words.
words (but not context words) to a citation form.
We suspect that this lost quite a bit of information
and negatively affected the system?s overall perfor-
mance, since there is considerable correlation be-
tween form and sense, especially for verbs. Nev-
ertheless, we have made no attempt to re-engineer
the student systems, and have not thoroughly inves-
tigated how big a difference this stemming made.
3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Results
Table 2 shows the results per word, and table 3
shows results by part-of-speech and overall, for the
SENSEVAL-2 English lexical sample task. It also
shows what second-order classifiers were selected
for each word. 54.2% of the time, we made an opti-
mal second-order classifier choice. When we chose
wrong, we usually made a mistake in either ensem-
ble size or method, rarely both. A wide range of
second-order classifier types were chosen. As an
overview of the benefit of combination, the globally
best single classifier scored 61.2%, the locally best
single classifier (best on test data) scored 62.2%, the
globally best second order classifier (ME-7, best on
test data) scored 63.2%, and our dynamic selection
method scored 63.9%. Section 3.3 examines combi-
nation effectiveness more closely.
3.2 Changes from SENSEVAL-2
The system we originally submitted to the
SENSEVAL-2 competition had an overall accu-
racy of 61.7%, putting it in 4th place in the revised
rankings (among 21 supervised and 28 total sys-
tems). Assuming that our first-order classifiers
were fixed black-boxes, we wanted an idea of how
good our combination and selection methods were.
To isolate the effectiveness of our second-order
classifier choices, we compared our system to an
oracle method (OR-BEST) which chose a word?s
second-order classifier based on test data (rather
than held-out data). The overall accuracy of this
oracle method was 65.4% at the time, a jump of
3.7%.7 This gap was larger than the gap between
the various top-scoring teams? systems. Therefore,
while the test-set performance of the second-order
classifiers is obviously not available, it was clear
7With other changes, OR-BEST rose to 66.1%.

Abstract
This paper describes improved HMM-based word
level alignment models for statistical machine
translation. We present a method for using part of
speech tag information to improve alignment accu-
racy, and an approach to modeling fertility and cor-
respondence to the empty word in an HMM align-
ment model. We present accuracy results from eval-
uating Viterbi alignments against human-judged
alignments on the Canadian Hansards corpus, as
compared to a bigram HMM, and IBM model 4.
The results show up to 16% alignment error reduc-
tion.
1 Introduction
The main task in statistical machine translation is
to model the string translation probability   	 

where the string




in one language is translated
into another language as string


. We refer to


as the source language string and 
  as the target
language string in accordance with the noisy chan-
nel terminology used in the IBM models of (Brown
et al, 1993). Word-level translation models assume
a pairwise mapping between the words of the source
and target strings. This mapping is generated by
alignment models. In this paper we present exten-
sions to the HMM alignment model of (Vogel et al,
1996; Och and Ney, 2000b). Some of our extensions
are applicable to other alignment models as well and
are of general utility.1
For most language pairs huge amounts of parallel
corpora are not readily available whereas monolin-
gual resources such as taggers are more often avail-
able. Little research has gone into exploring the po-

tential of part of speech information to better model
translation probabilities and permutation probabili-
ties. Melamed (2000) uses a very broad classifica-
tion of words (content, function and several punctu-
ation classes) to estimate class-specific parameters
for translation models. Fung and Wu (1995) adapt
English tags for Chinese language modeling using
Coerced Markov Models. They use English POS
classes as states of the Markov Model to generate
Chinese language words. In this paper we use POS
tag information to incorporate prior knowledge of
word translation and to model local word order vari-
ation. We show that using this information can help
in the translation modeling task.
Many alignment models assume a one to many
mapping from source language words to target lan-
guage words, such as the IBM models 1-5 of Brown
et al (1993) and the HMM alignment model of (Vo-
gel et al, 1996). In addition, the IBM Models 3,
4 and 5 include a fertility model    where  is
the number of words aligned to a source word  . In
HMM-based alignment word fertilities are not mod-
eled. The alignment positions of target words are the
states in an HMM. The alignment probabilities for
word 
 depend only on the alignment of the pre-
vious word 


if using a first order HMM. There-
fore, source words are not awarded/penalized for be-
ing aligned to more than one target word. We present
an extension to HMM alignment that approximately
models word fertility.
Another assumption of existing alignment mod-
els is that there is a special Null word in the source
sentence from which all target words that do not
have other correspondences in the source language
are generated. Use of such a Null word has proven
problematic in many models. We also assume the

existence of a special Null word in the source lan-
guage that generates words in the target language.
However, we define a different model that better
constrains and conditions generation from Null. We
assume that the generation probability of words by
Null depends on other words in the target sentence.
Next we present the general equations for decom-
position of the translation probability using part of
speech tags and later we will go into more detail of
our extensions.
