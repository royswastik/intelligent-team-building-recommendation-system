Abstract 
The performance of a corpus-based language and 
speech processing system depends heavily on the 
quantity and quality of the training corpora. Although 
several famous Chinese corpora have been developed, 
most of them are mainly written text. Even for some 
existing corpora that contain spoken data, the quantity 
is insufficient and the domain is limited. In this paper, 
we describe the development of Chinese conversational 
annotated textual corpora currently being used in the 
NICT/ATR speech-to-speech translation system. A total 
of 510K manually checked utterances provide 3.5M 
words of Chinese corpora. As far as we know, this is 
the largest conversational textual corpora in the 
domain of travel. A set of three parallel corpora is 
obtained with the corresponding pairs of Japanese and 
English words from which the Chinese words are 
translated. Evaluation experiments on these corpora 
were conducted by comparing the parameters of the 
language models, perplexities of test sets, and speech 
recognition performance with Japanese and English. 
The characteristics of the Chinese corpora, their 
limitations, and solutions to these limitations are 
analyzed and discussed.  
 
1. Introduction 
 
In corpus-based machine translation and speech 
recognition, the performance of the language model 
depends heavily on the size and quality of the corpora. 
Therefore, the corpora are indispensable for these 
studies and applications. In recent decades, corpus 
development has seen rapid growth for many 
languages such as English, Japanese, and Chinese. For 
Chinese, since there are no plain delimiters among the 
words, the creation of a segmented and part-of-speech 
(POS)-tagged corpus is the initial step for most 
statistical language processes. Several such Chinese 
corpora have been developed since the 1990s. The two 
most typical are People?s Daily corpus (referred to as 
PKU), jointly developed by the Institute of 
Computational Linguistics of Peking University and 
the Fujitsu Research & Development Center [1], and 
the Sinica Corpus (referred to as Sinica) developed by 
the Institute of Information Science and the CKIP 
Group in Academia Sinica of Taiwan [2]. The former 
is based on the People?s Daily newspaper in 1998. It!
uses standard articles of news reports. The latter is a 
balanced corpus collected from different areas and 
classified according to five criteria: genre, style, mode, 
topic, and source. Although conversational text is also 
contained in this corpus, it has only 75K of utterances 
and the domains are limited to a few fields, such as 
academia and economics, and the style is mostly in 
address and seldom in conversation. 
Since the features of conversation differ from written 
text, especially in news articles, the development of a 
segmented and POS-tagged corpus of conversational 
language is promising work for spontaneous speech 
recognition and speech-to-speech translation.  
In the Spoken Communication Group of NICT, in 
order to study corpus-based speech translation 
technologies for the real world, a set of corpora on 
travel conversation has been built for Japanese, 
English, and Chinese [3]. These corpora are elaborately 
designed and constructed on the basis of the concept of 
variety in samples, situations, and expressions. Now 
these corpora have been used in the NICT speech-to-
speech translation (S2ST) system [8] and other 
services. 
In this paper, we introduce our work on this Chinese 
corpora development and applications in S2ST speech 
recognition using these corpora. In Section 2, we 
provide a brief description of the contents of the NICT 
corpora, then describe how the Chinese data were 
obtained. In Section 3, we illustrate the specifications 
for the segmentation and POS tagging designed for 
these corpora. Here, we explain the guidelines of 
segmentation and POS tagging, placing particular 
emphasis on the features of conversation and speech 
recognition application. In Section 4, we outline the 
development procedures and explain our methods of 
how to get the segmented and POS-tagged data. Some 
statistical characteristics of the corpora will be shown 
here. In Section 5, evaluation experiments of speech 
recognition utilizing these corpora are reported by 
comparing the results using the same data sets of 
70
Japanese and English. Finally, in Section 6, we discuss 
the performance of the corpora, the problems that 
remain in the corpora, and give our ideas concerning 
future work. 
 
2. Current NICT Chinese Corpora on 
Travel Dialog Domain 
 
At NICT, in order to deal with various conversational 
cases of S2ST research, several kinds of corpora were 
elaborately designed and constructed [3]. Table 1 gives 
a brief description of the data sets related to the 
development of the Chinese corpora. Each corpus 
shown in this table was collected using different 
methods, for different application purposes, and was 
categorized into different domains.

The SLDB (Spoken Language Database) is a 
collection of transcriptions of spoken language 
between two people speaking different languages and 
mediated by a professional interpreter. 
In comparison, the MAD (Machine Translation Aid 
Dialogue) is a similar collection, but it uses our S2ST 
system instead of an interpreter. 
The BTEC (Basic Travel Expression Corpus) is a 
collection of Japanese sentences and their English 
translations written by bilingual travel experts. This 
corpus covers such topics related to travel as shopping, 
hotel or restaurant reservations, airports, lost and 
found, and so on. 
The original data of the above corpora were 
developed in the form of English-to-Japanese 
translation pairs. The Chinese versions are mainly 
translated from the Japanese, but a small portion of 
BTEC (namely, BTEC4, about 70K of utterances) was 
translated from English. Every sentence in these 
corpora has an equivalent in the other two languages, 
and they share a common header (ID), except for the 
language mark. All the data in these three languages 
constitute a set of parallel corpora. The following 
shows examples of sentences in the three languages: 
Chn.: BTEC1\jpn067\03870\zh\\\\??????? 
Eng.: BTEC1\jpn067\03870\en\\\\I'd like to have some strong 
coffee. 
Jap.:BTEC1\jpn067\03870\ja\\\\???????????? 
 
3. Specifications of Segmentation and Part-
of-Speech Tagging 
 
By mainly referring to the PKU and taking into 
account the characteristics of conversational data, we 
made our definitions for segmentation units and POS 
tags. Here, we explain the outlines of these definitions, 
then illustrate the segmentation and POS-tagging items 
relating to those considerations on conversations. 
 
3.1. Guidelines of the Definitions 
 
(1) Compatibility with the PKU and Taking into 
account the Demand of Speech Recognition of 
S2ST 
Since the specification of segmentations and POS-
tagging proposed by the PKU [4] has its palpability 
and maneuverability and is close to China?s national 
standard [5] on segmentation and close to the 
specification on POS tags recommended by the 
National Program of China, namely, the 973-project 
[6], we mainly followed PKU?s specification. We 
adopted the concept of ?segmentation unit,? i.e., words 
with disyllable, trisyllable, some compound words, and 
some phrases were regarded as segmentation units. The 
morpheme character (word) was also regarded as an 
independent unit. 
However, we made some adjustments to these 
specifications. In the speech recognition phase of S2ST 
to deal with data sparseness, the word for ?training? 
needed to be shortened. So a numeral  was divided into 
syllabic units, while both the PKU and the Sinica took 
the whole number as a unit. For the same reason, the 
directional verbs (????), such as ??, ????
????? and ?? ,? which generally follow 
another verb and express action directions, were 
divided from the preceding verb. The modal auxiliary 
verbs (????), such as ?????and ?,? which 
often precede another verb were separated and tagged 
with an individual tag set. Because the numeral can be 
easily reunited as an integrated unit, such a processing 
method for numerals does not harm the translation 
phase of S2ST. Moreover, if the directional verb and 
the modal auxiliary verb can be identified, they will 
help the syntactic analysis and improve the translation 
phrase. These two kinds of verbs, together with ?? 
(be)? and ??  (have)? are more frequently used in 
71
colloquial conversations than in written text, so we 
took them as an individual segmentation unit and 
assigned a POS tag to each. The special processes for 
these kinds of words aim at reflecting the features of 
spoken language and improve the performance of the 
S2ST system. 
 
(2) Ability for Future Expansion 
Although the corpora were developed for speech 
recognition in S2ST system, it is desirable that they 
can be used in other fields when necessary. This 
reflects in both segmentation and POS-tagging. In 
segmentation, the compound words with definitive 
suffix or prefix are divided, so they can be combined 
easily when necessary. In POS-tagging, the nouns and 
verbs are mainly further categorized into several sub-
tags. We selected about 40 POS tags for our corpora, 
as shown in Table 1 in the Appendix. With such scale 
of tag sets, it is regarded to be suitable for 
language model of ASR. When necessary, it is 
also easy to choice an adequate tag set from it to 
meet the needs of other tasks. 
 
(3) Relation with the Corpora of Other Languages 
in NICT 
The original data of the corpora are in Japanese or 
English. It is meaningful to build connections at the 
morphological level among these trilingual parallel 
corpora at least for ?named entities.? For example, we 
adopted the same segmentation units as in Japanese, 
and we subcategorized these words into personal 
names, organization names, location names, and drink 
and food names and assigned them each an individual 
tag. Personal names were further divided into family 
names and first names for Chinese, Japanese, and 
Western names. These subclasses are useful in 
language modeling, especially in the travel domain.  
 
3.2. Some Explanations on Segmentation and 
POS-tagging 
 
(1) About Segmentation 
In our definition of a segmentation unit, words longer 
than 4 Hanzis (Chinese characters) were generally 
divided into their syntactic units. Idioms and some 
greeting phrases were also regarded as segmentation 
units. For example: ???/?????/???/??
? /.? Semantic information was also used to judge 
segmentation unit. For example:  
 
? ?/ ?/ ?/ ?/ ?/ ?/ ??/ ?/ (Tell me the best 
restaurant around here.) 
? ??/ ?/ ??/ ??/ ?/ ?/ ??/ ?/ (I'd like a 
hotel that is not too expensive.) 
 For segmenting compound words with different 
structures, we constituted detailed items to deal with 
them. These structures include ?coordinated (??)?
modifying (?? ), verb-object (?? ), subject-
predicate (??), and verb-complement (??).? The 
main consideration for these was to divide them 
without changing the original meaning. For those 
words that have a strong ability to combine with 
others, we generally separated them from the others. 
This was due to the consideration that if it were done in 
another way, it would result in too many words. For 
example, in the verb-object (?? ) structure, ?? 
(buy)? can combine with many nouns to get 
meaningful words or phrases, such as ???  (buy 
book), ?? (buy meat)??? (buy ticket)?and ??
?  (buy clothes).? We prescribed separating such 
active characters or words, no matter how frequently 
they are used in the real world, to ensure that the 
meaning did not change and ambiguity did not arise. 
So the above phrases should be separated in following 
forms: ??/ ?/ (buy book), ?/ ?/ (buy meat)??/ ?/ 
(buy ticket)?and ?/ ?? /buy clothes).?  
 For the directional verbs, we generally separated 
them from their preceding verbs. For example: 
?/ ??/ ?/ ?/ ??/ ??/ ?/ ?/ (Is it all right to move 
to another seat?) 
?/ ?/ ?/ ?/ ???/ ??/ ?/ ???/ ?/ (Please keep 
this suitcase until one o'clock.) 
Prefix and appendix were commonly separated from 
the root words. For example: 
??/ ?/ ?/ ?/ ??/ ?/ ?/ (Are all students going to 
Kyoto?) 
?/ ?/ ??/ ??/ ?/. (I do free-lance work.) 
 
(2) About POS-Tagging 
The POS tag sets are shown in Table 1 in the Appendix. 
The POS tagging was conducted by the grammar 
function based on how the segmentation unit behaves 
in a sentence. 
 
4. Procedure of Developing the Chinese 
Corpora 
 
The segmented and POS-tagged data were obtained in 
two steps. The first step was to get the raw segmented 
and POS-tagged data automatically by computer. The 
second was to check the raw segmented and POS-
tagged data manually. 
 
(1) Getting Raw Segmented and POS-Tagged Data 
The text data were segmented and POS tagged by 
using the language model shown in formula (1). 
)|()|()1()ww|(w)( 2-i1-iiii2-i1-ii cccPcwPPLP ?? ?+=    (1) 
72
Here iw  denotes the word at the ith position of a 
sentence, and ic  stands for the class to which the word 
iw  belongs. The class we used here is a POS-tag set, 
and  ?  is set 0.9. 
The initial data for training the model were from the 
Sinica due to their balanced characteristics. The 
annotated data were added to the training data when 
producing new data. When the annotated data reached 
a given quantity (here, the BTEC1 was finished, and 
the total words in the corpora exceeded 1M), the Sinica 
data were not used for training. We have conducted an 
experiment with this model for an open test text of 510 
utterances from BTEC, and the segmentation and POS-
tagging accuracy was more than 95%. Furthermore, 
proper noun information was extracted from Japanese 
corpora and marked in the corresponding lines of the 
Chinese segmented and POS-tagged data. 
 
(2) Manual Annotation 
The manual annotations were divided into two phases. 
The first was a line-by-line check of the raw segmented 
and POS-tagged data. The second was to check the 
consistency. The consistency check was conducted in 
the following manner: 
? Find the candidates having differences between the 
manually checked data and the automatically 
segmented and POS-tagged data.  
? Pick up the candidates having a high frequency of 
updating in the above step, and build an 
inconsistency table. The candidates in this table are 
the main objects of the later checks.  
? Check the same sentences with different 
segmentations and POS tags. 
? List all words having multiple POS tags and their 
frequencies. Determine the infrequent ones as 
distrustful candidates and add them into the 
inconsistency tables. 
The released annotated data were appended with a 
header ID for each token (pair of word entry and POS 
tag) in an utterance including a start marker and end 
marker, shown as follows: 
BTEC1\jpn067\03870\zh\\\00010\||||UTT-START|||| 
BTEC1\jpn067\03870\zh\\\00020\?|?||?|r||||

510K annotated data. From Figure 1, we know that the 
Chinese has the fewest words in an utterance, followed 
by English, with the Japanese having the most.

5. Evaluation Experiments 
 
To verify the effectiveness of the developed Chinese 
textual corpora, we built a language model for speech 
recognition using these corpora. For comparisons with 
other languages, including Japanese and English, we 
also built language models for these two languages 
using the same training sets. Meanwhile, the same test 
set of each language was selected for speech 
recognition.  
 
5.1. Data Sets for Language Models and 
Speech Recognitions  
 
For simplicity, we adopted word 2-gram and word 3-
gram for evaluating perplexities and speech 
recognition performance. The training data were 
selected from the 510K utterances in Table 1, while the 
test sets were also extracted from them, but they are 
guaranteed not to exist in the training sets. In 
evaluations of perplexity, 1524 utterances (a total of 
three sets) were chosen as the test set. In evaluation of 
recognition, 510 utterances were chosen as test set. For 
Japanese and English, the same data sets were also 
chosen for comparisons.

5.2. Comparisons of Language Models 
 
Using the above utterances in the training sets, a word 
2-gram and a 3-gram were built respectively for each 
language. The distributions of items inside these 
models were investigated. Figure 2 shows the ratios of 
2-gram?s items which have low occurrences (from 1 to 
6) in the 2-gram model.  
Compared with the other two languages, the Chinese 
has the biggest vocabulary. Moreover, it also has a 
large amount of low-frequency 1-gram, 2-gram, and 3-
gram items. For example, more than 60% of its 2-gram 
entries appear only once. This can be regarded that the 
Chinese has more varieties when expressing a same 
meaning than the other two languages. It is also partly 
due to bias occurred in the translation process, 
compared to the original languages. So the probability 
computations in 2 or 3-gram related to these entries 
were estimated by using a smoothing approach, so the 
accuracy is not high.  
Table 3 shows average sentence entropies (ASE) of 
the test sets to the 3-gram models. The ASE is obtained 
as follows: (1) first to get the  product of average word 
entropy and the total word count in test set. (2) then 
divide the product by the total sentences in the test set.  
From the table, we know the Chinese has the maximal 
sentence entropy (or maximal perplexity) among the 
three languages. This means that when predicate a 
sentence in the recognition process, Chinese requires a 
much bigger search space than the other two languages.

Figure 3. Word recognition accuracies of 3 languages 
 
The 2-gram language model was used for decoding 
recognition lattice, while the 3-gram model was used  
for rescoring process. The recognition results are 
shown in  Figure 3. Here, WordID  refers to the word?s 
outer layer (entry) together with its POS tag, other 
information like conjugation of verbs, declension of 
nouns, etc., while the surface word contains only its 
outer layer, no POS tag is contained  in this case . 
The difference in word accuracy of speech 
recognition between these two forms is about 2% for 
Chinese, and 1% for English and Japanese. 
 
6. Summary 
 
This paper described the development of Chinese 
conversational segmented and POS-tagged corpora that 
are used for spontaneous speech recognition in S2ST 
system. While referring mainly to the PKU?s 
specifications, we defined ours by taking into account 
the needs of S2ST. About 510K utterances, or about 
3.5M words of conversational Chinese data, are 
contained in these corpora. As far as we know, they are 
presently the biggest ones in the domain of travel, with 
a style of conversations. Moreover, a parallel corpus 
was obtained using these 510K pairs of utterances of 
Chinese, Japanese, and English. These corpora now 
play a big role in spontaneous language and speech 
processing, and are used in the NICT/ATR Chinese-
Japanese-English Speech-to-Speech Translation 
System [8] and other communication services. 
However, according to our evaluations in this paper, 
there are still some difference in performance among 
Chinese and other languages, especially Japanese. 
There is still some room to improve the quality of these 
corpora mainly because the Chinese text data were 
translated from other languages, mainly Japanese, with 
a few words from English. There is some bias in 
expression, especially for the transliterations of proper 
nouns. For examples, ?Los Angles? is translated as ??
??,???,???, and ???.?also, some 
utterances are not like those spoken by native speakers,

spontaneous text data.
