Abstract 
Degree distributions for word forms co-
occurrences for large Russian text collec-
tions are obtained. Two power laws fit the 
distributions pretty good, thus supporting 
Dorogovtsev-Mendes model for Russian. 
Few different Russian text collections 
were studied, and statistical errors are 
shown to be negligible. The model expo-
nents for Russian are found to differ from 
those for English, the difference probably 
being due to the difference in the collec-
tions structure. On the contrary, the esti-
mated size of the supposed kernel lexicon 
appeared to be almost the same for the 
both languages, thus supporting the idea 
of importance of word forms for a percep-
tual lexicon of a human. 
1 Introduction 
Few years ago Ferrer and Sol? (2001a) draw the 
attention of researchers to the fact that the lexicon of 
a big corpus (British National Corpus ? BNC ?in 
the case) most probably consists of two major com-
ponents: a compact kernel lexicon of about 103 ? 
104 words, and a cloud of all other words. Ferrer 
and Sol? studied word co-occurrence in BNC in 
(2001b). Two word forms1 in BNC were considered 
as ?interacting? when they appeared in the same 
sentence and the words? distance didn?t exceed 2. 
Ferrer and Sol? (2001b) treated also some other no-
                                                          
1 Strictly speaking, word forms, not words. 
tions of word interaction, but the results obtained 
don?t differ qualitatively. The interacting words 
form a graph, where the vertices are the words 
themselves, and the edges are the words? co-
occurrences. The fact of the collocation considered 
to be important, not the number of collocations of 
the same pair of words. Ferrer and Sol? (2001b) 
studied vertices degree distribution and found two 
power laws for that distribution with a crossover at a 
degree approximately corresponding to the previ-
ously found size of the supposed kernel lexicon of 
about 103 ? 104 words. In (Sol? et al 2005) word 
co-occurrence networks were studied for small 
(about 104 lines of text) corpora of English, Basque, 
and Russian. The authors claim the same two-
regime word degree distribution behavior for all the 
languages. 
Dorogovtsev and Mendes (2001, 2003: 151-156) 
offered an abstract model of language evolution, 
which provides for two power laws for word degree 
distribution with almost no fitting, and also explains 
that the volume of the region of large degrees (the 
kernel lexicon) is almost independent of the corpus 
volume. Difference between word (lemma) and 
word form for an analytic language (e.g. English) 
seems to be small. Dorogovtsev-Mendes model cer-
tainly treats word forms, not lemmas, as vertices in 
a corpus graph. Is it really true for inflecting lan-
guages like Russian? Many researchers consider a 
word form, not a word (lemma) be a perceptual 
lexicon unit (Zasorina, 1977; Ventsov and Kas-
sevich, 1998; Verbitskaya et. al., 2003; Ventsov et. 
al., 2003). So a hypothesis that word forms in a cor-
pus of  an inflecting language should exhibit degree 
distribution similar to that of BNC looks appealing. 
An attempt to investigate word frequency rank sta-
89
tistics for Russian was made by Gelbukh and Si-
dorov (2001), but they studied only Zipf law on too 
small texts to reveal the kernel lexicon effects. To 
study the hypothesis one needs a corpus or a collec-
tion2 of texts comparable in volume with the BNC 
part that was examined in (Ferrer and Sol?, 2001b), 
i.e. about 4.107 word occurrences. Certainly, texts 
that were analyzed in (Sol? et al 2005) were much 
smaller. 
Recently Kapustin and Jamsen (2006) and Ka-
pustin (2006) studied a big (~5.107 word occur-
rences) collection of Russian. The collection 
exhibited power law behavior similar to that of 
BNC except that the vertex degree at the crossover 
point and the average degree were about 4-5 times 
less than that of BNC. These differences could be 
assigned either to a collection nature (legislation 
texts specifics) or to the properties of the (Russian) 
language itself. We shall reference the collection 
studied in (Kapustin and Jamsen, 2006; Kapustin, 
2006) as ?RuLegal?. 
In this paper we present a study of another big 
collection of Russian texts. We have found that 
degree distributions (for different big sub-collec-
tions) are similar to those of BNC and of RuLegal. 
While the exponents and the kernel lexicon size are 
also similar to those of BNC, the average degree 
for these collections are almost twice less than the 
average degree of BNC, and the nature of this dif-
ference is unclear still.  
The rest of the paper has the following struc-
ture. Technology section briefly describes the col-
lection and the procedures of building of co-
occurrence graph and of calculation of exponents 
of power laws. In Discussion section we compare 
the results obtained with those of Kapustin and 
Jamsen (2006), Kapustin (2006), and (Ferrer and 
Sol?, 2001b). In Conclusion some considerations 
for future research are discussed. 
2 Technology 
At present Russian National Corpus is unavailable 
for bulk statistical research due to copyright con-
siderations. So we bought a CD (?World Literature 
in Russian?) in a bookstore ? a collection of fiction 
translations to Russian. We?ll call the collection 
                                                          
2 We consider a corpus to be a special type of a text collection, 
which comprises text samples chosen for language research 
purposes, while a more general term ?collection ? refers to a 
set of full texts brought together for some other purpose. 
WLR. The size of the whole collection is more 
than 108 word occurrences. The source format of 
the collection is HTML, but its files contain essen-
tially no formatting, just plain paragraphs. We 
made three non-overlapping samples from WLR 
(WLR1?3). The samples were approximately of 
the same size. Each sample was processed the 
same way. The idea behind using more than one 
sample was to estimate statistical errors. 
We used open source Russian grapheme analy-
sis module (Sokirko, 2001) to strip HTML and to 
split the texts into words and sentences. Word co-
occurrences were defined as in (Ferrer and Sol?, 
2001b): two words are ?interacting? if and only if 
they: (a) appear in the same sentence, and (b) the 
word distance is either 1 (adjacent words) or 2 (one 
word or a number or a date in-between). A found 
co-occurred pair of words was tried out against 
MySQL database of recorded word pairs, and if it 
wasn?t found in the database, it was put there. 
Then we use a simple SQL query to get a table of 
count of vertices p(k) vs. vertex degree k. 
Figure 1. Raw degree distribution for WLR1. 
The raw results for one of the samples are 
shown on Fig. 1. For the two other samples the 
distributions are similar. All distributions are al-
most linear (in log-log coordinates, that means that 
they obey power law), but fitting is impossible due 
to high fluctuations. As noted by Dorogovtsev and 
Mendes (2003: 222-223), cumulative distribution

P(k) = ?K?k p(K) fluctuates much less, so we 
calculated the cumulative degree distributions 
(Fig.2). Cumulative degree distributions for all 
three WLR samples are very similar.

WLR1 (lower curve) and RuLegal (upper curve). 
3 Discussion 
To estimate statistical errors we have normalized 
the distributions to make them comparable: the 
degree ranges were reduced to the largest one, then 
the cumulative degree distribution was sampled 
with the step of 1/3, as in (Ferrer and Sol?, 2001a, 
Dorogovtsev and Mendes, 2003: 222-223). When 
we use WLR samples only, the statistical errors are 
less than 7% in the middle of the curves and reach 
a margin of 77% in small degrees region. With the 
inclusion of RuLegal sample, difference between 
samples becomes larger ? up to 13% in the middle 
of the curves), but are still small enough. 
In both cases (with and without RuLegal) we 
attempted to fit either a single power law (a 
straight line in log-log coordinates) or two/three 
power laws with one/two crossover points. Strong 
changes and large statistical errors of the distribu-
tions in the low degree region prevent meaningful 
usage of these points for fitting. We have made 
attempts to fit all three approximations for all 
points, and omitting one or two points with the 
lowest degrees. To choose between the hypotheses 
we minimized Schwarz information criterion 
(Schwarz, 1978): 
SIC=N*ln(?i(pi-p?i)2/N)-m*ln(N) 
where pi ? cumulative distribution at i-th point; 
 p?i ? fitting law at the same point; 
 N ? number of sampling points (13?15, 
  depending on the number of  
  omitted points); 
 m ? number of fitting parameters (2, 4 or 6) 
SIC (1/2/3 power laws) Omitted

Clearly two power laws fit the curves better. 
The exponents, the crossover degree and estimated 
size of the kernel lexicon (number of vertices with 
high degrees above the crossover) for the best fits 
(two powers, zero/one omitted point) are shown in 
Table 2. The exponents for the raw distributions 
are ?1 and ?2 minus 1. 
Disagreement between English and Russian 
seems to exist. Probably, the differences are still 
due to the collections? nature (the difference be-
tween different Russian collections is noticeable). 
4 Conclusion 
We found that ergodic hypothesis for word form 
degree distribution seems to work for large text 
collections ? differences between the distributions

are small (except for the few smallest degrees). At 
least, a single big enough sample permits reliable 
calculation of degree distribution parameters. 
Dorogovtsev-Mendes model, which yields two 
power laws for the degree distribution for the word 
forms graph, gives pretty good explanation both 
for an analytic language (English) and for an in-
flecting one (Russian), though numeric parameters 
for both languages differ. The estimated sizes of 
the supposed kernel lexicons for the both lan-
guages are almost the same, the fact supports the 
point that word form is a perceptual lexicon unit. 
To make more rigorous statements concerning 
statistical properties of various languages, we plan 
to calculate other important characteristics of the 
co-occurrence graph for Russian: clustering coeffi-
cient and average shortest path. Also we hope that 
legal obstacles to Russian National Corpus usage 
will have been overcome. Other statistical lan-
guage graph studies are also interesting; among 
them are investigation of networks of lemmas, and 
statistical research of agglutinated languages.
