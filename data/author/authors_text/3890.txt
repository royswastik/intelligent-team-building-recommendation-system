Combining elements appropriately within a coherent page layout is a well-recognized and crucial 
aspect of sophisticated information presentation. The precise function and nature of layout has 
not, however, been sufficiently addressed within computational pproaches; attention is often 
restricted to relatively local issues of typography and text-formatting, leaving broader issues of 
layout unaddressed. In this paper we focus on the selection and function of layout in pages that 
appropriately combine textual and graphical representation styles to yield coherent presentation 
designs. We demonstrate hat layout offers a rich resource for achieving presentational coherence, 
alongside more traditional resources such as text-formatting and the text-internal marking of 
discourse connections. We also introduce an integrated approach to layout, text, and diagram 
generation. Our approach is developed on the basis of a preliminary empirical investigation 
of professionally produced layouts, followed by implementation within a prototype information 
system in the area of art history. 
1. Introduction 
The desirability of combining text, layout, graphics, diagrams, punctuation, and type- 
setting in order to present information most effectively is uncontroversial--indeed, in 
traditional graphic design and publishing, they could scarcely be conceived of as sep- 
arate. It is therefore natural that computational ttempts to synthesize texts, diagrams, 
and layout automatically should also now converge. In this paper, we argue that effec- 
tive and coherent information presentation is best supported by adopting a common 
framework for physical ayout and language/diagram generation. Whereas previous 
research as made this point convincingly for graphical and textual representations-- 
particularly, for example, in the WIP (Andr4 et al 1993), COMET (Feiner and McK- 
eown 1993), and SAGE (Kerpedjiev et al 1997; Green, Carenini, and Moore 1998) 
systems--we take this further and demonstrate that the same commonalities extend 
to include overall page layout, an area that has not previously received sufficient 
attention.

The paper focuses on two aspects of automatic information presentation new in 
our work: 
? a general mechanism for organizing presentations around informational 
regularities in the data to be expressed--the r gularities then inform the 
presentational strategies used for natural anguage, diagrarn, and layout 
generation; 
? the construction of an indirect relationship between structured 
communicative intentions (typically represented in both mono- and 
multimodal work by some kind of rhetorical structure) and their 
expression in page layout. 
The former allows us to ensure broad consistency of perspective and informational 
organization across elements presented using different media e.g., across diagram 
and text; the latter allows us to draw closer to the kind of sophisticated layout that is 
observable in human-produced presentations. 
We organize the paper as follows. We first introduce the mechanism for data- 
driven aggregation that we have developed, since this underlies our approach to both 
natural anguage generation and diagram design (Section 2). We then sketch the place 
of layout as an organizing framework within our approach as a whole (Section 3), 
setting out by means of examples ome of the issues focused upon in the empirical in- 
vestigation (Section 4). We then summarize the results of the empirical study in terms 
of an abstract specification for performing page layout (Section 5) and provide a first il- 
lustration of its application within the prototype multimodal information-presentation 
system DArtbio (Dictionary of Art: biographies) (Section 6). We conclude by summa- 
rizing the main contributions of our work and some of the follow-up research and 
development to which it is now leading (Section 7). 
2. Data-driven Aggregation for Visualization and Natural Language Generation 
It is commonly recognized in work on multimodal information presentation that much 
of the true value of such presentations lies in appropriate juxtapositions of non- 
identical but overlapping information. Textual presentations and graphical presen- 
tations have differing strengths and weaknesses and so their combination can achieve 
powerful synergies. Conversely, simply placing textual and graphical information to- 
gether is no guarantee that one view is supportive of another: if the perspective on the 
data taken in a graphic and that taken in a text have no relation (or, worse, even clash), 
then the result is incoherence rather than synergy--cf, the discussions by authors uch 
as Arens, Hovy, and Vossers (1993), Fasciano and Lapalme (1996), Green et al (1998), 
and Fasciano and Lapalme (2000). 
One means of ensuring mutually compatible presentations across modes is to 
drive both the language and the graphic generation from the same communicative 
intentions. If an automatic natural anguage generator and an automatic graphic gen- 
erator both receive the task of expressing broadly similar, or compatible, intentions 
then there is a good chance that the resulting presentations will also be perceived to 
be compatible and mutually supportive. This has been used to good affect in systems 
such as CGS (Caption Generation System) of Mittal et al (1998), where it is clearly 
crucial that the text and the graphic be in close correspondence. Another, in some 
ways related, approach is to derive both the graphic and textual elements from dif- 
ferent components of a single presentation plan: thus, for example, one part of the 
410 
Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generation 
presentation plan might express textually an instruction that must be carried out (turn 
the dial), while another part of the plan elaborates on that instruction by showing a 
diagram in which the location of the action to be performed is identified graphically. 
This has been explored extensively in systems uch as WIP (Andr~ et al 1993), PPP 
(AndrG Rist, and Mfiller 1998), and COMET (Feiner and McKeown 1993). 
While both of these approaches are essentially top-down, or goal driven, effective 
presentations can also be produced by responding to regularities found in the data 
to be presented. Such regularities are difficult to predict as they are strongly contin- 
gent on what set of data happens to have been selected. "Data-driven" methods of 
this kind are commonly found in automatic visualization, where the goal is to present 
users with some comprehensible view of large collections of data. Utilizing regularities 
in the data is essential for effective visualization. In previous work (Reichenberger, 
Kamps, and Golovchinsky 1995), a set of techniques for generative diagram design 
were developed for precisely this task, i.e., for presenting overviews of datasets. We 
subsequently recognized that this approach also has applications to the task of ag- 
gregation in natural anguage generation, and we thus adapted it for use across both 
textual and graphical presentation modes. This provides a further technique for en- 
suring consistency between graphical and textual presentations--if both the graphical 
and textual presentations express the same regularities, or redundancies, that have 
been found in a dataset, then they are necessarily compatible in this respect. This al- 
lows us to use contingent data-driven organizations for generating information while 
nevertheless preserving coherent and mutually supportive views across presentation 
modalities. 
2.1 Data-driven Aggregation: the Mechanism 
The original generative diagram-design algorithms developed by Reichenberger, 
Kamps, and Golovchinsky (1995) built on the landmark work of Mackinlay (1986). 
Here, a data-classification algorithm flexibly links relational data with elements of a 
graphical language. These elements are allocated particular degrees of expressiveness 
so that appropriate graphical resources can be selected as required to capture the data 
being described. Reichenberger t al. extended this approach by employing a general 
type hierarchy of data properties to determine algorithmically the most specific property 
subtype (e.g., transitive, acyclic directed graph, inclusion, etc.) that accurately describes 
a dataset to be visualized. This subtype allows in turn selection of the particular forms 
of diagrammatic representation (e.g., trees, nested boxes, directed arrows, etc.) that are 
expressively adequate, but not over-expressive, for that dataset. 
The theoretical basis of these methods is given in detail in Kamps (1997; 1998). 
They rest on a new application of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) (Wille 1982). FCA is 
an applied mathematical discipline based on a formal notion of concepts and concept 
hierarchies and allowing the exploitation of mathematical reasoning for conceptual 
data analysis and processing. In particular, FCA permits the efficient construction of 
dependency lattices that effectively represent the functional and set-valued ependen- 
cies established among the domains of some data relation. Such dependency lattices 
can then motivate the differential selection of appropriate graphical presentations. 
FCA starts from the notion of a formal context (G,M,I) representing a dataset 
in which G is a set of objects, M is a set of attributes, and I establishes a binary re- 
lation between the two sets. I(g, m) is read object g has property m where g c G and 
m E M. Such a context is called a one-valued context. For illustration, we draw on 
the domain of the DArtbio system that we discuss below: an example of a one-valued 
context corresponding to the attribute Profession for a set of artists is shown in the 
table to the left of Figure 1. Concepts in FCA are defined in accordance with the

traditional theory of concepts, and consist of an extension and an intension. The 
extension is a subset A of the set of objects G and the intension is a subset B of 
the set of attributes M. We call the pair (A,B) a formal concept if each object of 
the extension has all the properties of the intension. Thus, for the data shown in 
Figure 1, the pair ({Gropius, Breuer}, {Urban Planner, Architect}) represents a for- 
mal concept: each of the members of the extension possesses all the attributes men- 
tioned in the intension. The set of all concepts for some formal context can be com- 
puted effectively using the Next Closure algorithm developed by Ganter and Wille 
(1996). 
The main theorem of concept analysis then shows that the set of concepts for a 
formal context can be organized into a complete lattice structure under the follow- 
ing definition of the subconcept relation: a concept (A,B) is a subconcept of (A*,B*) 
if and only if A c A* ~ B* _c B (Wille 1982). The concept lattice may be con- 
structed by starting from the top concept (the one that has no superconcepts) and 
proceeding top-down recursively. In each step we compute the set of direct subcon- 
cepts and link them to the respective superconcept until we reach the greatest lower 
bound of the lattice itself (the existence of which is always guaranteed for finite-input 
data structures). An efficient implementation f this algorithm is given in Kamps 
(1997). The lattice corresponding to our example one-valued context is given to the 
right of Figure 1. This lattice shows the full labeling of formal concepts in order 
to ease comparison with the originating table. Much of this information is redun- 
dant, however, and so we generally use variations on the abbreviated, more concise, 
form shown in Figure 2. Such lattices naturally capture similarities and differences 
between the values of the specified attributes of objects: each concept of the lattice 
indicates objects with some set of values in common. Moreover, the generalizations 
are organized by subsumption, which supports the selection of most-specific sub- 
types. 
When considering datasets in general, we typically need to express more informa- 
tion than that of single attributes and for this we require mult i -valued contexts. An 
example of a multi-valued context is shown in Table 1, which includes our previous 
one-valued context as one of its columns; for ease of discussion, however, we will 
for the present restrict he Profession attribute so that each artist has only one profes- 
sion. The table shows the subject areas/professions, institutions, and time periods in 
which the indicated artists were active. Formally, a multivalued context is a general- 
isation of a one-valued context and may be represented as a quadruple (G,M,W,I) 
where G, M, and I are as before, and W represents he set of values of the attributes--

consists of just those elements which are added at that node moving up the lattice; conversely 
the members of the intensions are shown moving down the lattice, again adding just those 
elements that are new for that node. For example, the node labeled simply Gropius, Breuer 
corresponds to the full form ({Gropius, Breuer}, {Architect, Urban Planner}) since both 
Gropius and Breuer are newly added to the extension at that node, while no new elements are 
added to the intension--'Architect' and 'Urban Planner' are both inherited from above.

which are, in contrast o the one-valued-context case, not trivially either true or false, 
applicable or not. To identify the value w c W of attribute m E M for an object 
g E G, we adopt the notation rn(g) = w and read this as attribute m of object g has 
value w. 
Kamps (1997) renders multivalued contexts amenable to the techniques for depen- 
dency-lattice construction by deriving a one-valued context that captures the func- 
tional dependencies of the original multivalued context. To see how this works, we 
first note that a functional dependency in a relation table is established when the fol- 
lowing implication is always true: for two arbitrary objects g, h E G and two domain 
sets D,D* E M, then D(g) = D(h) ~ D*(g) = D*(h). This implication suggests the 
following construction for an appropriate one-valued ependency context: for the set 
of objects take the set of subsets of two elements of the given multi-valued context 
P2(G); for the set of attributes take the set of domains M; and for the connecting inci- 
dence relation take IN( {g,h}, m) :~=~ m(g) = m(h). The required dependency context is 
then represented by the triple (P2(G),M, IN). This is illustrated in the table to the left 
of Figure 3, which shows the one-valued context corresponding to the multivalued 
context of Table 1. An entry here indicates that the identified attribute has the same

value for both the facts identified in the object labels of the leftmost column: for exam- 
ple, gl and g2 share the values of their Profession and School attributes. This provides 
a wholistic view of the dependency structure of the original data and is, moreover, 
computationally simple to achieve. 
It is then straightforward toconstruct a dependency lattice as described above; this 
is shown to the right of Figure 3. The arcs in this lattice now represent the functional 
dependencies between the involved domains, and the equalities (e.g., m(gl)=m(g2)) 
represent the redundancies present in the data. For example, the lower left node labeled 
Period indicates not only that the third- and fourth-row entries under Period (g3 and 
g4) are identical but also, following the upward arc, that these entries are equal with 
respect o School; similarly, following upward arcs, the middle node (m(gl)=m(g2)) 
indicates that the first- and second-row entries (e.g., gl and g2) are equal with respect 
to both School and Profession. The lattice as a whole indicates that there are functional 
relationships from the set of persons into the set of professions, the set of periods, and 
the set of schools. A further functional relationship exists from the set of periods into 
the set of schools. 
Once such a lattice has been constructed, we also have as a consequence a set 
of classifications of the original relational input, or dataset. This can directly drive 
visualization as follows. For graphics generation, it is important hat all domains of 
the relation become graphically encoded: this means the encoding is complete. Kamps 
(1997) proposes a corresponding graphical encoding algorithm that starts encoding the 
bottom domain and walks up the lattice employing a bottom-up/left-to-right strategy 
for encoding the upper domains. The idea of this model, much abbreviated, is that 
the cardinality of the bottom domain is the largest, whereas the domains further up 
in the lattice contain fewer elements. Thus, the bottom domain is graphically encoded 
using so-called graphical elements (rectangle, circle, line, etc.), whereas the upper 
domains are encoded using graphical attributes (color, width, radius) and set-valued 
attributes that must be attached to graphical elements. In general, it is preferable 
to maximize graphical attributes over set-valued attributes as this keeps graphical 
complexity moderate. 
Figure 4 shows two example diagrams that are produced from the dataset of 
Table 1 via the dependency lattice shown to the right of Figure 3. Informally, from 
the lattice we can see directly that artists (Person) can be classified on the one hand 
according to work period (following the lefthand arc upwards) and, on the other hand, 
jointly according to school and profession (following the vertical arc). The algorithm first 
allocates the attribute Person, indicated in the lowest node of the lattice, to the basic 
graphical element rectangle; the individual identities of the set members are given by 
a graphical attachment: a string giving the artist's name. The functional relationship 
between the set of persons and the set of time periods is then represented by the further

graphical attribute of the length of the rectangle. This is motivated by the equivalence 
of the properties of temporal intervals in the data and the properties of the graphical 
relationship of spatial intervals on the page. Two paths are then open: following the 
functional relationship first to either a set of schools or to a set of professions. Diagram (a) 
in Figure 4 adopts the first path and encodes the school relationship by means of the 
further graphical attribute of the color of the rectangle, followed by a nesting rectangle 
for the relationship to Professions; diagram (b) illustrates the second path, in which 
the selection of graphical encodings is reversed. Both the selection of color and of 
nesting rectangles are again motivated by the correspondence b tween the formal 
properties of the graphical relations and those of the dependencies observed in the 
data. Reinstating the multiple professions of Gropius and Breuer mentioned in Figure 1 
gives rise to a rather different dependency lattice in which the second solution is no 
longer possible. 
All of these mechanisms were implemented and used extensively for visualization 
in the context of an Editor's Workbench for supporting editorial decisions during the 
design of large-scale publications uch as encyclopedias (Rostek, M6hr, and Fischer 
1994; Kamps et al 1996). 1
2.2 The Partial Equivalence of Diagram Design and Text Design 
A selection of particular graphical elements entails the expression of particular func- 
tional dependencies. This is similar to decisions that need to be made when generating 
text. For instance, the equality rn(gl) = re(g2) in the lattice of Figure 3 above can also 
motivate a particular grouping of information in a corresponding linguistic presenta- 
tion. That is, whereas graphically the equality motivates an association of both Gropius 
and Breuer with the graphical attributes allocated to Professions and Schools, textually 
we may connect both artists in a single sentence: i.e., gl (concerning Gropius) and g2 
(concerning Breuer) can be compactly expressed by collapsing their (identical) school 
and profession attributes: 
Both Gropius and Breuer were architects and taught at Harvard. 
A similar phenomenon holds for the grouping re(g3) = rn(g4); here, g3 (concerning A. 
Albers) and g4 (concerning J. Albers) may be succinctly expressed by collapsing their 
identical period and school attributes.

Combining these considerations motivates the following approximate textual re- 
rendering of diagram (b): 
Anni Albers (who was a designer) and J. Albers (who was an urban planner) 
both taught at the BMC from 1933 until 1949. Moholy-Nagy (who was also an 
urban planner) taught from 1937 until 1938 at the New Bauhaus. Gropius and 
Breuer (both architects) were, at partially overlapping times (1937-1951 and 
1937-1946 respectively), at Harvard. Hilberseimer (who was an architect too) 
taught at the IIT from 1938 until 1967. 
A textual re-rendering of diagram (a) would reflect he contrasting roupings entailed 
there: i.e., Breuer, Gropius, and Hilberseimer would be grouped at top level whereas 
the two Albers would not. 
A dependency lattice extracts partial commonalities that remain constant over 
subsets of the data to be presented and this is closely related to the problem of ag- 
gregation in NLG (cf., Dalianis \[1999\]). The functional redundancies captured by the 
lattice construction are precisely those redundancies that indicate opportunities for 
structurally induced aggregation. Selecting a particular graphical element or attribute 
to realize some aspect of the data is in fact an aggregation step. In Bateman et al 
(1998), we have shown this in terms more familiar to NLG by re-interpreting in de- 
pendency lattice terms some of the standard examples of aggregation discussed in 
the literature. Below, we show that mutual consistency between textual fragments 
produced by our NLG component and graphical elements produced by the automatic 
visualization component can be enforced by driving both from a common dependency 
lattice. 
3. Preliminaries for Layout: Inputs and Outputs for the Layout Determination Task 
Page layout, more properly termed typographic design, is usually divided into three 
levels: microtypography, macrotypography (layout proper), and style. Here we are 
most concerned with macrotypography--the segmentation of a page of information 
into more or less closely related "visual blocks." Macrotypography is a central com- 
ponent of professional document design; indeed, 
Every designer knows that how elements are put together on a page 
communicates a powerful message (Adobe Inc., InDesign product in- 
formation sheet). 
Unfortunately, with some valuable exceptions (cf., for example Schriver \[1996\], Waller 
\[1988\] and Bernhardt \[1985\]), the professionals do not then go on to tell us just what 
that message might be. 
Our starting point for investigating layout and its message rests on the fact that 
layout is not a fixed property of information presentation; i.e., similar information can 
be subjected to diverse layouts. We then assume, following Schriver (1996) and others, 
that layout decisions should be functionally motivated in terms of a presentation's 
communicative purposes. We illustrate this further, while at the same time setting 
the scene for our empirical investigation, by briefly considering the kinds of layout 
variation that are commonly found. We do this in two steps. First, we characterize 
more finely the notion of layout as such; then, we consider how selections among 
possible layouts may be motivated. 
416 
Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generation 
3.1 Layout structure 
Issues of layout were already present within the visualization framework discussed 
above. For example, the relationship of the graphical blocks representing particular 
artists, or the positioning of the diagrams' legends with respect o the diagrams them- 
selves, all involve decisions of layout. The solution developed as part of the automatic 
visualization component used in the Editor's Workbench was to consider layout itself 
as a particular class of diagrams, with their own particular properties and concerns. 
An automatic page-layout component (APALO) was accordingly implemented as a 
specialization of the general visualization task. 
Fully specified layout diagrams pecify the physical placement and appearance of
elements on a page. In order to generalize across such layouts we define an abstract 
level of representation called Layout Structure. Layout structure abstracts across the 
precise details of physical layouts to focus on classes of layouts that are visually 
"equivalent." Visually equivalent layouts suggest he same page blocks, with similar 
inter-block relationships of perceived prominence and similarity. 
Our view of layout structure draws heavily on Southall (1992), who defines a re- 
stricted set of typographical relation types. These include: containment, i.e. recursive 
block structure; reading order, i.e., generally left-to-right, op-to-bottom reading paths 
in Western cultures; similarity, describing blocks that share some visual properties 
such as size, typeface selection, structure, etc.; and reference, where a connection be- 
tween visual blocks is suggested by physical proximity. We represent layout structures 
in terms of a tree structure (representing containment) augmented by a restricted set 
of possible additional annotations corresponding to the remaining typographical rela- 
tion types. The annotations thus serve either to further constrain the possible physical 
layouts that may render the layout structure, or to place mutual constraints on the ren- 
dering possibilities--for example, a type-equivalence annotation requires consistency 
in rendering decisions across the units declared to be type-equivalent. 
A simple example of layout structure and its correspondence to a physical layout is 
shown in Figure 5. Here we see that annotations also provide a numerical summary of 
the information to be displayed in any layout element (which may be either descriptive 
or denote a target): for example, node 2.3.2 in the figure is annotated 403w+3p:50, 
indicating that it consists of a block of text with 403 words and 3 pictures, and is 
allocated an importance score of 50%. 2 These scores impose target visual weights for 
corresponding page elements (i.e., more important nodes should be more prominent, 
which can be achieved by larger surface area combined with less but more heavy type, 
by use of prominent colors, etc.). More information concerning layout structure and 
its motivation is given in Reichenberger t al. (1996). 
Given a fully specified layout structure as input, APALO renders it as a physical 
page by mapping constituency to nested boxes (i.e., inclusion diagrams), and strength 
of connection and sequence to spatial displacement: the boxes included within an en- 
closing box are arrayed two-dimensionally to influence reading order. Typographic 
attributes, such as type size, specific type face within the family (bold, italic etc.), 
arrangement of the type (ragged right, flush matter, etc.), leading, coloring and orien- 
tation, are all assigned at this stage, respecting any constraints on presentation given 
in the abstract layout structure. Since it is rarely the case that a layout structure is 
so tightly specified that only one physical ayout is possible, the implementation uses 
progressive refinement and allows a user either to stop the process at any point or

to continue searching for better layouts until a stable state is achieved. The rendering 
aspect of APALO corresponds broadly to other components that have been designed 
for page layout (e.g., Feiner \[1988\] or Graf \[1995\]), but differs from these in that it is 
not restricted to any particular page model (e.g., a grid system). 
Our subsequent considerations of layout motivation adopt fully specified layout 
structures as their target. Such structures will include presentation content as produced 
by the natural-language-generation and automatic-diagram-generation components in
their terminal elements, and are responsible for enforcing communicatively effective 
layouts. 
3.2 Communicative-Functional Structure and its Relationship to Layout Structure 
For automatic information presentation we also require a representation f the com- 
municative intentions to be fulfilled by a presentation. For this, we adopt "standard" 
rhetorical structure theory (RST) as set out in Mann and Thompson (1986). RST is se- 
lected for two reasons: first, it is one of the most elaborated and widely used forms of 
analysis of communicative intentions and has been applied to a wide variety of texts; 
and second, it is well established in NLG and has already been applied to multimodal 
information presentation (cf., Andr6 and Rist \[1993\]). 
Originally, RST sought to describe the recursive structure of any text in terms 
of rhetorical relations which hold between the segments (called spans) of the text. 
Rhetorical relations are either symmetric (multinuclear), in which case the text spans 
related are considered of equal importance for the text, or assymetric, in which case one 
text segment among those related by a relation is singled out as being more essential 
to the writer's purposes (the nucleus) than the others (the satellites). RST defines 
itself as a functional theory, in that the segments related are functional rather than 
textual--i.e., a rhetorical relation need not have any specific grammatical or lexical

\[1\] There are many reasons that the Bauhaus

onto the market in increasing numbers. \[4\] But 
there were two main reasons. \[5\] First, many ex-

realization. RST's functional orientation supported a further re-interpretation f RST 
in which rhetorical relations become plan operators for text construction (cf., Moore 
and Paris \[1993\]; Hovy \[1993\]). From this perspective, rhetorical structures represent a 
plan for achieving some goal via linguistic means. The information maintained at the 
leaves of such RST text plan structures i thus not pre-existing text, but rather chunks 
of information that are to receive textual realizations. 
If, as is common in NLG, we consider the information-presentation ask to involve 
the expression, or realization, of a text plan expressed according to RST and, further, we 
see the layout used in that information presentation as one of the decisions that needs 
to be made, then we face the question as to whether the text plan can also motivate 
the necessary layout decisions. In Figure 6, we show a simple invented text fragment 
and a corresponding RST analysis. We will use this text in two ways: First, it stands 
as a shorthand for a set of propositions from the knowledge base or domain mode l - -  
during NLG, and following text planning, the rhetorical structure is as shown but the 
leaves identify the propositions indicated rather than textual elements. Second, the text 
stands as one possible result of the subsequent NLG process, where the propositions 
grouped in the text plan have already received their linguistic realization. This double 
use is harmless because we do not use the textual version to motivate any of the 
decisions taken during the NLG process whose task it is to produce it. 
The RST structure states that the text divides into two main segments, span (1-3) 
and span (4--6), and that these are related by the rhetorical relation concession. This 
indicates that the main allegiance and point of the writer lies with the nucleus (span 4- 
6), but that, at the same time, the writer does not claim that the seemingly contradictory 
information in the satellite (span 1-3) does not hold. The principal purpose of using an 
RST-concession relationship is to strengthen one's own argument by showing that one 
is aware of a possible objection but are already able to dismiss it. Common linguistic 
markers of concession are however, although and, as adopted here, but. In the embedded 
trees, the satellite tree involves an RST justify relationship between a (relative) nucleus 
(1) and the span (2-3), the nucleus tree involves an elaboration relationship between 
a (relative) nucleus (4) and the span (5-6). Both spans (2-3) and (5-6) are examples 
of the RST joint schema: this simply combines the connected propositions into a set 
without assigning any difference in nuclearity among them. A justify relationship 
holds when the satellite gives information intended to justify the writer's right to 
419 
Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3 
present he information in the nucleus (i.e., in this case, the claim that there are many 
reasons for the Bauhaus preading is backed up by the examples offered in (2) and (3)); 
and the elaboration relationship holds when further specifying information concerning 
some aspect of the nucleus is given. There are approximately 25 RST relations in the 
standard set and space precludes giving more details of them here: their definitions 
and examples of use are given, however, in numerous places in both the computational 
and (text-)linguistic literature. 
The realization of an RST structure as a natural language text involves many 
important issues which we will also not address here. Instead, we focus on the rela- 
tionship between an RST-style presentation plan, and layout decisions; in particular, 
given our goal of determining a layout structure that can then be rendered as a physi- 
cal page layout, we ask how the information in a rhetorical structure may be placed in 
correspondence with appropriate layout structures. In the text of the previous figure, 
for example, one layout decision that could be made is that there is no particular lay- 
out to be done--this is then equivalent to a straightforward, monomodal NLG system 
producing text only. The text in the figure is already an example. Another possible 
decision, lying at the opposite extreme, is to say that every node of the RST structure 
should find some direct correspondence in a node of the layout structure. This would 
be to require that the entire constituency structure of the RST tree be signaled visually 
in the layout. While both options are possible, it should be clear that there are many 
others. For example, span (1-3) could be represented as a single layout element (i.e., a 
single visual block consisting of a text paragraph) with span (4-6) breaking down into, 
perhaps, a single layout element for the nucleus (6) and two further layout elements, 
one for each of the members of the satellite. 
The situation is made yet more complex by the presence of a steady trade-off 
between information expressed via layout and information expressed via text. For 
example, if the spans (1-3) and (4-6) are allocated to distinct layout units, allowing 
them to vary independently of one another in terms of microtypography and physical 
placement, hen it is considerably less likely that the RST concession relationship will 
be preserved linguistically. Similar considerations arise within the two spans: the more 
the RST structure is decomposed, resulting in typographical distinctions, the less use 
is made of explicit linguistic discourse marking. A compelling illustration of this can 
be seen in the complex graphic-text combination discussed in Kerpedjiev et al (1998) 
in which a text fragment is re-expressed graphically. 
This variability needs to be brought under motivated control. Information pre- 
sented together, or in similar styles, is perceived as related regardless of whether this 
was intended by the page designer or not; conversely, information presented in differ- 
ent styles, or separated widely on the page, is interpreted as unrelated. Critical work 
in professional document design demonstrates that failure to respect such entailments 
of layout makes a page or diagram difficult to interpret and possibly misleading: see, 
for example, Schriver (1996) and the numerous references cited there. But it is also well 
known that not all of the possible details of document structure are normally presented 
in layout: the relationship is substantially more flexible. This presents a problem for 
any approach to multimodal presentation that adopts too close a relationship between 
presentation-plan elements and layout--as most previous ystems have in fact done. 
4. A Methodology for the Empirical Investigation of Communicative-Functional 
Page Layout 
Given our goal of understanding more precisely what can happen between a specifi- 
cation of communicative intentions--expressed in terms of a presentation plan using 
420 
Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generation 
a representation such as RST--and a fully specified layout structure that passes on 
intention-appropriate constraints o a page-rendering engine, we embarked on an em- 
pirical investigation ofthe kinds of variability that occur in real documents. For this, we 
developed a methodology for exploring the functional basis of page layout in general. 
Two caveats are required here: first, our experimental method was exploratory--as 
one of the first studies of its kind, we needed to respond with flexibility to the results 
of the analysis; and second, since our aim was to move quickly from first analysis 
results to prototype system in order to evaluate the feasibility and value of the entire 
scenario in practice, the study was deliberately restricted in scope. 
4.1 Method of Analysis 
The provision of appropriate multimedia corpora for supporting the kind of empirical 
analysis we required is still, several years later, very much in its infancy. 3 The main 
criteria for the selection of pages for our investigation were (a) that the entire page 
be concerned with a single topic, while nevertheless presenting various aspects of 
that topic by means of varied text structuring and typographical nd layout decisions, 
and (b) that the page demonstrate "interesting" layout. This led us to consider pages 
drawn from popular magazines, ince these exhibit highly varied typographical nd 
layout decisions in the hope of being eye-catching and maintaining interest. 
The detailed structure of our study was as follows. We took a set of pages selected 
according to criteria (a) and (b), and asked for each page why it was set out as it was. 
We answered this question by: 
? 
2. 
. 
. 
. 
providing a layout structure representation for each page; 
constructing a single "text" out of the entire "content" of the page 
(including headings, picture captions, pictures, etc.) that captured as far 
as possible the perceived purpose of the page; 
performing a "functional text structure analysis" of the constructed text 
respecting the perceived purpose of the page (and therefore of the 
constructed text); 
considering whether the page-layout s ructure could be derived 
straightforwardly from the text structure; 
deriving and informally evaluating alternative "possible" layouts on the 
basis of a progressively refined set of layout principles. 
We illustrate our approach by setting out in detail one round of analysis concerning 
a single illustrated page. The page used is shown in Figure 7 and is drawn from 
the German illustrated sport and health magazine Fit for Fun (1995 (5), 92). The article 
describes various aspects of the game Unihoc, presenting background information con- 
cerning how the game is played, where it is popular, and why it is popular, as well 
as some pointers to further information and the equipment needed to play it. The 
page was typical of a series of feature articles being run in the magazine at that time. 
Particular elements expressed using layout in the page are indicated in the figure: 
significant here is solely the physical layout of the page, not the content. 
3 Two projects currently involved with gathering and annotating such data re ICONOCLAST 
(Bouayad-Agha, Scott, and Power 1996) and GEM (Delin, Bateman, and Allen, forthcoming). Corio 
and Lapalme (1998) have also presented results of a corpus tudy.

4.2 An Illustrative Round of Analysis: Preparation 
The starting point for our analysis was provided by our initial page-selection criteria, 
i.e., that there is some body of material that the author(s) of the page wish to present. 
It is then relevant (and necessary) to ask how this information is to be broken up 
for effective presentation. To do this, we set out the content of each page as a single 
constructed text: The constructed text for the Unihoc page is given in Figure 8. Note 
that this text already reflects our understanding of the function of the page in its 
context of use: we assume that the page has the main functions of informing readers 
about a game that they might not be familiar with and telling them that the game is 
in fact finding increasing support both internationally and nationally. 
This approximate, "pre-analytic" understanding of the page's communicative func- 
tion is then made more explicit by providing a detailed functional text-structure analy- 
sis using RST. The RST structure offers a plausible presentation plan that can serve as a 
starting point for considering possible and contrasting realizations of this information 
as a two-dimensional page. The constructed text has to then be viewed in a similar 
way to the example fragment concerning the Bauhaus that we used in Section 3,2. 
In many respects, it is not a text at all, in that it overcommits to particular forms of 
linguistic expression and linear ordering. NLG uses of RST do not (in general) allow 
the RST structure to specify particular relative orderings between nuclei and their re- 
spective satellites. The ordering needs to be decided during generation so that issues 
of textual fluency can be addressed appropriately. The same then holds for our con- 
422 
Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generation 
\[0\] Astrid Frula, captain of the German National Unihoc team, writes: \[1\] 
Among the Swedes it is the most popular and best-known branch of sport. 
\[2\] We are talking about Unihoc, also called Floorball or Indoor Bandy. \[3\] 
This mixture of hockey and ice hockey is attracting ever more supporters. 
\[4a\] Since the middle of the eighties, this dynamic team sport has also been 
played in Germany and \[4b\] the step to becoming a school sport is imminent. 
\[5\] Unihoc can be played in the gym as well as outside, on grass or ice. \[6a\] 
Because the ball can be played with both sides of the stick, \[6b\] it is much 
easier to master than normal hockey. \[7\] One can continue playing behind 
the goal (four metres up to the board) and \[8\] there is no offside rule. \[9\] 
Stopping the ball with the stick and the foot is allowed, as well as playing 
via the board. \[10\] Raising the blade of the stick above knee height, or lifting, 
hitting, or holding the opponent's stick is not allowed. \[11\] Entering the goal 
area, playing the ball while lying or kneeling, moving the stick between the 
legs of the opponent, or engaging in hard body contact is also prohibited. \[12\] 
Unihoc allows many alternatives in how it is played. \[13\] One possibility: \[14\] 
each team has six players, and no goalie. \[15a\] In front of the goal there is a no- 
go area - \[15b\] no players are allowed within a semicircle of almost 2 meters 
in radius. \[16\] The second alternative requires more tactical insight: \[17\] here 
there are 6 players per team, plus a goalie. \[18\] Each receives a clear function, 
which determines their effective playing area. \[19a\] The two defenders may 
only act within their own half; \[19b\] in contrast, the two attackers may only 
play within their opponents' half. \[20\] Only the midfield players can run 
as they wish over the entire playing field. \[21\] In this exciting variant solo 
artists have no chance. \[22\] Spotting a free team member and passing the 
ball on are essential. \[23\] Two variants have become dominant. \[24\] On the 
large field (forty metres long, twenty metres wide) two six-person teams with 
fixed goalie oppose each other (Playing time: two times twenty minutes). \[25a\] 
A board keeps the ball continuously in play; \[25b\] rest periods hardly ever 
occur. \[26\] As in ice hockey, a player substituting for another does not lead 
to an interruption of play (up to eight substitute players per team). \[27\] This 
is the variant that is used in international matches. \[28\] The German Unihoc 
Union (0421/4984255) frequently goes back to the small field variant: \[29\] 
where mixed 4-person teams play without a goalie. \[30\] The playing field is 
only thirty metres long and sixteen metres wide, while the playing time is 
halved. \[31\] The goals are also smaller than on the large field. \[32\] The goals 
(60 x 90 centimeters) are collapsible. \[33\] In the gym, light holed plastic balls 
(20 grams, 8 centimeter diameter) are used. \[34\] The sticks (Kevlar 95 Mark, 
plastic 10 Mark) are 100 to 120 centimeters in length. \[35\] Complete sets of 
Unihoc equipment cost around 450 Marks. \[36\] Info: 05357/18181. \[37\] 05.-

structed text. Text spans corresponding to sibling nuclei and satellites are considered 
unordered; any ordering in the text is only partial, as given by the RST presentation 
plan. 
This is doubly appropriate here because we cannot generally provide a unique 
linear text that re-expresses precisely the information that is given in an original two- 
dimensional page, and so this is not the constructed text's function here. The text 
simply provides a shorthand for the content hat must necessarily be presumed to un- 
derlie the page's production. Moreover, it is necessary in any case to reconstruct the 
intended content of the page because the page itself is unsuited to stand as the basis 
for an RST analysis. A page's most salient features are visual--i.e., typographical-- 
and part of our claim is that this is not directly indicative of rhetorical organization: 
relationships between visual blocks on the page are at a different level of abstraction 
than rhetorical relations. Assuming an equivalence of levels would probably lead to 
rhetorical analyses that primarily involve joint schemas conjoining the (many) top- 
level visual blocks of any page such as the Unihoc page; and at the same time it 
would leave the alternations across differing but communicatively similar layouts un- 
explained. 
The RST analysis for the constructed Unihoc text, and hence of the page, is shown 
in Figure 9. The RST analyses that we use were arrived at following the standard tech- 
niques of cross-coder checking, consultation and consensus. The RST diagram follows 
the conventions illustrated above in Figure 6 but uses considerably more rhetorical 
relations. Again, space precludes listing the definitions of the RST relations found in 
the analysis, but the definitions employed are exactly as given in the literature. The 
analysis in the figure also includes the information presented in the original page as 
photographs or diagrams. These have been labeled alphabetically (A, B, etc.) as iden- 
tified in Figure 8 and have been anchored into the RST-tree at appropriate places with 
plausible relations. 4 
The RST analysis makes our interpretation of the function of the text/page fully 
explicit. The central nucleus for the page as a whole is unit \[3\], i.e., This mixture of 
hockey and ice hockey is attracting ever more supporters. We are therefore considering the 
primary purpose of the page to be a statement that Unihoc is becoming very popular 
(and so the reader should be well up on it). The segments immediately following 
the nuclear span, \[5\] and \[6\], give some of the reasons why the sport is becoming so 
popular (with rhetorical relation volitional cause), and then segment \[7-11\] gives an 
overview of the do's and don'ts of the game. The main bulk of the constructed text 
consists of a concession that, although Unihoc allows many alternatives in how it is played 
\[12\], two variants have become dominant \[23\]. The existence of alternatives i supported 
by the two possibilities presented in segments \[13-15\] and \[16-22\], both related by 
the relation evidence to the nuclear \[12\]; the two main alternatives are elaborated in the 
explicit contrast drawn in segments \[24-27\] and \[28-31\]. Finally, the segments \[32-36\] 
and \[37-44\] provide additional elaborating material concerning where and when the 
game can be seen and what equipment is necessary to play it. 
A page such as this presents a considerable challenge for models of automatic 
layout. A closer indication of this complexity is provided by Table 2, which shows the 
correspondence b tween informational segments identified in the RST presentation 
4 The analysis as shown is not a correct RST structure because it admits differing relations as satellites of
a single nucleus: a strictly correct structure would need to show more intermediate s gments in order 
to have one type of relation apply within each segment. Since this would have complicated the 
diagram even further, we have simplified for purposes of exposition, although the existence offurther 
structure simplifies the task of the layout-structure construction specification we give below.

different one: we sought to constrain this process of producing layout structures as 
far as possible, and to examine whether certain allocations of informational units to 
layout units could be ruled out on general principles. 
4.3 Alternative Renderings of the Constructed Text and their Evaluation 
In order to probe the limits of the flexibility suggested above, we next considered alter- 
native page-layout realizations of the communicative-functional i tent represented in
the rhetorically organized presentation plan. Our initial hypothesis was that, since the 
RST analysis represents a statement of the varying degrees of centrality attributed to 
the text segments present on the page, then these nuclearity assignments should also 
be reflected in the organization of any page layouts selected. Concretely, this hypothe- 
sis means relating text spans to nodes in the layout structure, with the nucleus of any 
span assigning higher weight to its corresponding layout structure node. This requires 
that the units found in the layout structure correspond only to proper subtrees within 
the RST structure and that elements grouped in the layout also be grouped within 
the RST tree. We refer to such a layout structure as respecting the "natural divisions" 
of the RST structure. Our investigation then evaluated this hypothesis by considering 
successively more complex "possible" layouts.

Contrasting page layouts decomposing the source text: (a) Page rendition with minimal layout 
decisions, (b) Page rendition with random layout decisions. 
First, for example, we can note that if the aim of the author/editor/multimodal 
presentation system were not to present an interesting page design, then a layout such 
as that shown in Figure 10(a) might suffice. This presentation contains almost no lay- 
out decisions that subdivide the text into segments or establish relations of similarity 
and difference among those segments. The only subdivisions are the heading, text- 
body, and author divisions; the pictures of the original have been inset into the main 
text block approximately where their content is touched upon in the text. Neverthe- 
less, this would seem a perfectly possible (if, by current astes, dull) rendering of the 
material to be presented. It could be appropriate, for example, in an extremely densely 
presented lexicon or encyclopedia where space constraints and tradition suppress lay- 
out variation. This layout therefore serves to represent one endpoint in a continuum 
of possible layouts that need to be accommodated in any general account. It is also a 
further illustration of the trade-off between information that is expressed linguistically 
through explicit textual realization and information that is carried by the layout: our 
constructed Unihoc text needs to do more explicit linguistic signalling of discourse re- 
lations and communicative function than does the version employing layout. A reader 
should be able to recover this information from reading the text but it is not supported 
by an explicit layout encoding; we return to this issue below. 
We consider this case to emphasize that layout is concerned with choice. This is 
very similar to the state of a fairs in NLG: the main principle is that a speaker/writer 
has to choose how to present information and, whenever there is choice, there is meaning: 
that is, the choice is not free and some choices will be more appropriate than others 
in particular contexts. Moreover, the layout decomposition that is selected should be 
in some way coherent with respect o the communicative functions of the page. The 
next example layout, shown in Figure 10(b), illustrates this by presenting a layout 
427

in which choices, we would argue, have not been made coherently. The unmotivated 
decisions that make this layout incomprehensible include: the Unihoc variants section 
breaks down into two parts of differing visual appearance; additional information 
(events) becomes excessively important due to its prominent position and font size; 
and the information about he author is related only to the first textblock and not to the 
entire article. Such problems are identical to those arising in the NLG task: when more 
flexibility of expression/presentation is made available---for example, by considering 
generation with respect o a grammar with broader coverage--it s essential to control 
this flexibility appropriately in order to avoid wrong decisions. 
The problematic nature of the layout of Figure 10(b) can be succinctly stated: it 
violates our initial hypothesis concerning the desired correspondence b tween RST 
structure and layout structure: the constituency structure of the layout and that of the 
RST tree are in direct opposition at several points. For example, there is no distinc- 
tion drawn in type face between page elements introducing the game and describing 
the rules (which are relatively more nuclear), and elements describing some of the 
variants, whereas other variants are presented as a separate lement with a larger, 
more prominent ype face; these decisions are not, therefore, motivatable on the basis 
of the RST structure. Most serious, however, is the way in which the division into 
two elements describing the game variants has been done: these elements involve 
segments which do not correspond to RST-subtrees at all. Indeed, the second segment 
(corresponding to \[19a\]-\[22\] in the RST tree) goes further and breaks the RST structure 
at two points: segment \[19a\]-\[20\] is related by elaboration to unit \[18\] while segment 
\[21\]-\[22\] is related, also by elaboration, to unit \[16\]. The combined segment, \[19a\]-\[22\], 
is therefore composed of two completely disjoint and unrelated parts of the RST tree; 
we show this graphically in Figure 11. In general, such layout structures are indeed 
found to be difficult to interpret coherently (cf., Schriver \[1996\]). 
The simplest strategy for producing an appropriate layout is therefore to restrict 
layout decomposition and constituency to the "natural divisions" established in the 
RST analysis. Any subtree is then, at least in principle, a candidate for selection as a 
layout unit. Accordingly, we suggest hat the constructed layout shown in Figure 12 
does fulfill the tasks of rendering the communicative intentions of the original page 
quite well. A relatively large number of layout decisions have been taken--for instance, 
the most important statements form a block of their own at the top of the page, 
additional peripheral information is placed in a vertical gray margin bar, and the main 
text is divided in two sections: The rules and Unihoc variants. Despite this diversity, the 
page remains coherent by virtue of the congruence of its layout structure with the RST 
structure; this is summarized in Table 3. 
While this rendering of the RST structure is perhaps acceptable as a simple layout, 
we must observe that it still does not approach the complexity and diversity of the

natural layouts produced for the kind of magazine from which the original page was 
taken. Therefore, while conformance to the RST structure may prove itself a necessary 
(or at least, very desirable) condition, it is by no means ufficient for the construc- 
tion of appropriate layouts. The layout decisions taken in the original Unihoc page 
included both significantly more variety in the layout and typeface resources allo- 
cated, and a greater degree of decomposition. Moreover, although most of the design 
decisions appear coherent with respect o the notion of natural division developed 
so far, it is not the case that all of the layout decompositions are covered--in fact, 
rather more decompositions and discriminations are being made. This is shown graph-

ically in Figure 13 where the layout decomposition is explicitly contrasted with the 
RST structure; here we can see that, although the decomposition generally respects 
RST subtrees, it is not the case that we can transparently map this to a corresponding 
recursive layout structure. This rather common situation led us to accept hat render- 
ing the information in an RST-structure is not a simple decomposition, but is itself 
a planned activity. Information is taken from the RST-structure for various purposes 
and, as a consequence, both differing degrees of detail and varying decompositions 
must be supported. 
5. Towards Automatic Page Layout: An Algorithm for Communicatively Motivated 
Layout 
We have shown that an RST-analysis of the desired content for a page can be used to 
argue that a layout structure is more, or less, appropriate, and can indicate possible 
points of decomposition i to layout units. We now go one step further and set out 
a procedure for the mapping of RST-style presentation plans into layout structures. 
Mapping is generally achieved by placing parts of the RST-structure in correspondence 
with particular nodes in a layout structure. This proceeds recursively down through 
the RST tree. As we have now seen, however, the correspondence is complicated by 
the fact the layout structure and the RST tree need not remain congruent. 
430 
Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generation 
We divide the mapping procedure into a core component, which supports the full 
range of layout options that appear possible given our corpus tudy, and a set of further 
heuristics that guide the translation process in particular cases. Most of the heuristics 
are concerned with the question of whether decomposition f the RST structure should 
stop at some point or continue to produce amore specific layout structure. In contrast, 
the core component is straightforward--mostly because the layouts observed exhibit 
such flexibility that few hard constraints seem to apply. 
5.1 Core Translation Procedure: Recursive Descent 
At any point in an RST structure, we can consider the correspondence b tween the 
RST subtree descending from that point and an appropriate layout structure. The 
translation procedure assumes trong locality in that, when decomposing a subtree, 
it does not look outside of that tree to make its decisions. As the layout structure is 
constructed, layout units can be either open, in which case they are still accepting 
additional material from the RST structure as recursive descent continues, or closed, 
in which case the extent of their content has been fixed. Translation begins by positing 
a single layout unit that will hold all of the content of the RST-subtree, and a single, 
at that point empty, open descendant layout unit. If the mapping process decides that 
there is no need for any further layout decomposition--as in a monomodal, traditional 
NLG environment with neither graphics nor headings--then the open layout unit 
is closed off containing the entire RST tree being considered. This content (and its 
rhetorical organization) would then be passed off to the natural anguage generator 
in the usual way. 
In most documents, however, layout decomposition occurs, and so the layout 
structure has to be grown further. This is achieved by partitioning the set of RST- 
structure segments available at the current level of RST structure (segments are indi- 
cated in RST diagrams by the horizontal lines: cf., Figures 6 and 9) into those that are 
to be accepted into the current layout unit and those that are not. When any segment 
is not accepted, the RST relational link is cut at that point, the accepted segments are 
added to the current layout unit (which remains open), and the cut segment is added 
to a new, closed layout unit inserted parallel to the original ayout unit. The accepted 
partition must include at least the nucleus at that level of RST structure; this means 
that it is not possible to include satellites in the current layout unit and then exclude 
the nucleus--this would correspond to the unnatural division shown in Figure 11 
above. Crucially, it is quite possible for all of the segments to be accepted and for 
recursive descent o continue without having closed the current layout unit. Both closed 
and open layout units are then further developed according to the recursive structure 
of their respective RST segments. 
When a decision is made to cut an RST link, and the segments to be partitioned 
belong to a multinuclear relation or joint schema, then all the related segments are 
extracted and associated with sibling layout units. The layout units thus introduced 
are also annotated with type-equivalence links, while reference annotations are added 
between pictures and text within single RST-structure segments. The weight annota- 
tions are allocated in direct proportion to the nucleus and satellite distinctions: the 
nucleus receives the highest weight, with the remaining distributed over the satellites 
(see Section 3). We have not yet been able to explore appropriate weightings in any 
sophisticated manner, and so their effect on alternative layouts remains a subject for 
further investigation. 
In summary, the process of recursive descent of the RST tree can be seen broadly 
as one of deciding where to break RST links. Breaking a link (either a span-to-nucleus 
link or a nucleus-to-satellite link) causes the material thus separated from the tree

to be allocated its own layout unit, standing in a sibling relationship to the current 
layout unit, i.e., that unit corresponding tothe RST material from which the span was 
broken. Material that is not separated in this way remains part of the information 
content o be expressed by the current layout unit. This means that RST subtrees 
related hierarchically in the RST tree may be assigned to sibling layout units. The 
process is shown graphically in Figure 14. 
This can therefore lead to a significant loss of structure resulting from the fact 
that the dominance relations holding in the RST structure are not maintained in the 
layout structure. The core translation procedure thus results in a steady reduction 
in the complexity of the structure being constructed compared to the RST structure 
from which it derives. In the Unihoc original page, this is the situation with the seg- 
ment \[12-22\] (Unihoc variants): this satellite is broken out of its potential embedding 
within the dominating segment \[1-6\]+\[12-31\] and appears instead as a layout sibling 
of the remaining Intro unit that realizes \[1-6\]+\[23-31\]. This action has two common 
consequences: first, the layout weight of the broken-out unit is reduced and, second, 
the fact that a layout unit has been severed from its functionally motivated parent 
(i.e., the nucleus) appears in many text types sufficient grounds for introducing a
further layout unit that has the task of explicitly signalling what the relation was. 
This additional layout unit appears as a header or title (e.g., the AIIe Formen sind 
m?~glich--(all forms are possible--of the original page). A header is then the layout 
equivalent of a discourse marker. However, since headers cannot ypically function 
as relationally as discourse markers (because they cannot readily point back to their 
point of origin), they tend instead to give sufficient information for the reader to make 
a connection--for example, by summarizing the nucleus of their segments. While we 
currently attribute the reduction in layout weight to the core translation, the provi- 
sion of headers again appears to be a genre-specific concern and so we keep this as a 
heuristic. 
Removing structure can, if unconstrained, lead to some very undesirable layouts: 
for example, we could take the entire RST structure of the Unihoc constructed text 
apart from the last satellite of the Equipment subtree to produce two parallel ayout 
units: the rest of the text and the fact that one can get information about the Equip- 
ment by telephoning the given number. Our translation process partially avoids this 
situation by employing media-allocation (i.e., whether layout units are to be realized 
textually, graphically, pictorially, etc.) to force partitions whenever there is a difference 
432 
Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generation 
in medium. For example, if one segment of a partition is to be realized as a photo- 
graph and another as a textblock, then it is not possible to accept both of these into the 
open layout unit. This is motivated by the fact that we do not have a means of com- 
bining the content of photographs and text other than by allocating them to distinct 
layout units and positioning them in appropriate proximity; we return to the issue of 
media allocation below. The rule serves to avoid insignificant satellites being giving 
a prominent layout status by increasing the likelihood that prior decomposition will 
have already taken place. 
Moreover, we have observed two further forces that restrict objectionable ayouts 
of this kind: first, whenever a collection of layout units are constructed as siblings, 
their relative weights need to be ascertained--the further down (vertically and in 
terms of nucleus-satellite status) in the RST structure, the lower relative weight an 
associated layout unit receives. 6 Second, we add a heuristic that disprefers isolating 
relatively insignificant satellites that lack substantial substructure of their own. The 
strength of this heuristic appears to vary significantly according to the genre of the 
information being presented: for example, newspapers now appear to be considerably 
more willing to promote lower subtrees to the status of layout siblings than are the 
pages that were the subject of our empirical investigation. We will return to this aspect 
of layout variation in the conclusion. 
Finally, although we cannot pursue this theme further here, the gradual reduc- 
tion in structural complexity proposed has several suggestive similarities with what 
happens when monomodal, linear text is produced from an underlying RST-like struc- 
ture. There too, structural complexity is replaced by explicit linguistic oding operating 
linearly from one clause or utterance to the next. The linguistic encoding must give 
sufficient clues for a reader/hearer to make an attempt at recovering the intended 
structure, but does not itself appear to exhibit that structure. In this respect, one- 
dimensional text and two-dimensional layout may not be as different as might have 
been thought. 
5.2 Layout Units and Layout Forms: Bottoming Out 
When the decision has been made not to continue decomposition of an RST subtree 
into further layout units, the entire content associated with the subtree, as well as its 
rhetorical organization, is placed in correspondence with a terminal layout unit. That 
layout unit is then allocated a layout form. Layout forms can be either graphical (e.g., 
diagram, photograph, etc.), or textual. Examples of textual layout forms are textblocks 
consisting of paragraphs, enumerated lists, itemized lists, and the like. The broad 
choice between graphical and textual ayout forms is made by the media-allocation 
decision described below. 
Significantly, some textual ayout forms have substructure of their own. We con- 
sider them complex forms within a single layout unit (rather than conjoined layout 
units), because they appear to have rather limited scope for independently flexible 
layout within their enclosing layout units--it is unusual to format distinct elements 
in an enumerated list with different ype families, type sizes, or colors, etc. When a 
layout form requires further structure, we talk of layout elements extending the orig- 
6 This may even occur in the Unihoc page. On the righthand edge towards the bottom there is a very 
small piece of text citing the source of the photographs. Since this information can be seen as 
elaborations of the photographs, we have an example of a situation where avery insignificant segment 
(for the content) isbroken out and given its own layout unit. The consequence is, predictably, that it 
receives very little visual weight.

inal layout structure downwards: for example, the textual layout form itemized list 
introduces layout elements for each of its items. We have considered modeling this in 
two ways: first, by allowing the textual ayout-form textblock to include formatting 
similar to that provided in HTML or  I~TEX; 7 and, second, by simply allowing the RST- 
to-layout ranslation process to recurse further with a restricted range of allowable 
layout forms. 
While the first approach is straightforward to implement and is closer to exist- 
ing approaches to punctuation and formatting in NLG (Sefton 1990; Hovy and Arens 
1991; White 1995; Pascual 1996), the latter appears to offer more scope for investigating 
the trade-offs between layout and linguistic realization mentioned above. It may also 
prove necessary for more aggressively graphical documents hat include traditionally 
graphical elements (e.g., pictures, icons, etc.) within the confines of traditionally tex- 
tual elements (e.g., items in itemized lists). A textual layout form is still most often, 
however, a site of relative textual stability and will generally enforce linguistic and 
layout (e.g., style, punctuation) uniformity on the content hat is expressed: for ex- 
ample, rendering all items of a list as nominal phrases, verb phrases, sentences, etc., 
as considered appropriate. This occurs in several places within the Unihoc page: in 
the case of the Equipment segment, for example, we have the correspondences indi- 
cated in Table 4. The Events segment is similar, with enumeration by date followed 
by a textblock as the enumeration trailer. In both cases, typographical constraints are 
selected for the overall layout unit and these are then enforced for each constituent 
layout element. 
At present, we consider the motivations for distinct textual forms only very 
straightforwardly: if there are diverse RST relations present in the content correspond- 
ing to a layout unit, then we favor generating running text for that content; if there 
is a strong multinuclear RST organization (as, in the present example, the sequence 
seen in \[37-44\] or the joints in \[7-11\]), then we favor an itemized list of some kind. 
Exhaustive presentation combined with strict sequencing leads us to favor an enu- 
meration; less exhaustivity or lack of strict sequencing moves us through bulleted lists 
to simple sequences of offset paragraphs. These heuristics are currently enforced by 
simple calculations concerning depth of RST relation, ratio of relation types to number 
of segments, etc. 
7 This would appear to correspond closely to the level of representation called a DocRep (Document 
Representation) in the reference model for generation architectures that have been proposed within the 
RAGS project (RAGS Project 1999). 
434 
Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generation 
5.3 Media Allocation 
During the construction of layout structure, the translation process attempts to de- 
termine appropriate media allocations for the layout units introduced. Although, in 
general, this needs to be a motivated selection of presentation mode using criteria 
such as those discussed by Arens and Hovy (1990), Arens, Hovy, and Vossers (1993), 
Feiner and McKeown (1993), and others, for our current purposes we have restricted 
this decision to information that can be gained from a dependency-lattice analysis 
of the information content associated with segments from the RST tree. Thus, when 
considering the partition of segments at some point in the recursive descent through 
the RST tree, the translation process requests a dependency lattice for each segment 
and, depending on the result, assigns a likely medium choice. The currently possible 
allocations are diagram, photo, text, and complex. The main choice, however, is be- 
tween diagram and text; the photo option is self-selecting--i.e., if information is only 
available as a picture then that is what will be slotted into the layout structure, and 
the complex option is selected whenever there are self-selecting segments deeper in 
the RST subtree being considered. 
The heuristic that we employ for allocation assumes that the more simultaneous 
dimensions of regularity are present, the more likely it is that a diagram will be 
the more perspicuous representation. The rationale for this can be readily seen from 
the suggested text version of the diagrams in Figure 4. The text version does not 
read fluently precisely because it struggles to express imultaneously the co-varying 
dimensions of school, profession and time period. The fact that there are so many co- 
varying dimensions i , however, readily available from the dependency lattice: when 
a dataset has extensive and simultaneous regularities then these are present as nodes 
in the lattice. Thus, when there are co-varying dimensions of potential aggregation, a 
medium allocation of diagram is made, when not, text is selected. These allocations 
are then employed in the decision of whether to cut an RST relational link as described 
above. 
The dependency lattices used for media selection are maintained as additional 
information that is drawn on during both natural language and diagram generation. 
Moreover, and depending on the rhetorical relation, there can be co-ordination such 
that a satellite must re-use the dependency lattice already calculated for its nucleus. 
This is shown concretely in our DArtbio discussion below. 
5.4 The Unihoc Pages 
With the translation process described so far, we can come close to producing arealistic 
layout structure for the Unihoc RST structure. Beginning at the top of the RST structure 
in Figure 9, our first set of segments o partition is {\[A+0\], [1--44\]}: both have a complex 
medium allocation and so we cut the RST structure at this point. The satellite \[A+0\] 
is associated with a closed layout unit and the nucleus \[1--44\] with a sibling open 
unit. Whereas both segments have further ecursive structure, their treatment is now 
different: because the satellite unit is closed, its rhetorical substructure now contributes 
to embedded layout units (i.e., the process recurses here); in contrast, the nucleus unit 
is open, which means that its rhetorical structure may still contribute top-level sibling 
layout units. And this is what happens. The next set of segments to be partitioned 
is {\[1\], \[2\], \[3-4\], \[5+D,E\], \[6\], \[7-11\], \[12-31\], \[32-36\], \[37-44\]}; the nucleus is \[3- 
4\] and so the decision concerns which satellites, if any, are to be grouped with the 
nucleus and which are not. Our heuristic concerning regular substructure (ratio of 
relation types to segments) picks out \[5\], \[7-11\], \[32-36\] and \[37-44\] as good candidates 
for their own layout units; moreover, the units \[5\] and \[32-36\] are also complex by 
virtue of the fact that tbey include photographs. This leaves the segments {\[1\], \[2\],

\[3-4\], \[6\], \[12-31\]} for inclusion within the current open layout unit, while the others 
are each added as sibling closed units. The process continues in this fashion, eventually 
adding all of the material under \[3-4\] to the open unit, as well as the nucleus of \[12- 
31\]. The satellite of \[12-31\] is cut, however, and is therefore added as a closed layout 
unit. Note that since we are still adding material to the original open layout unit, this 
latter satellite also ends up as a top-level sibling. An indication of the entire layout 
structure of the original page is shown in Figure 15. In addition to the constituency 
relationships we have discussed so far, the layout structure includes reference links 
introduced between pictures and text related within single RST structure segments, as 
well as equivalence links introduced between units associated with members of RST 
joint schemas. 
When rendered as a page, the layout structure does not indicate any type-equiva- 
lence links between the top level units; so, apart from the prominence that should be 
accorded to the main-line, nuclear textblock, there is no clear relationship of similarity 
between any of the remaining decomposed units. We can therefore xpect either the 
same form to be used for all of them (for a "quieter" page layout) or differing forms 
to be used for each (for a "louder" page layout). 8 Probably unsurprisingly, given 
its intended audience and function, the page as published adopts the latter option, 
yielding the diversity that we saw displayed in Table 2. 
The same RST structure also stands as a starting point for the production of lay- 
out structures corresponding to the alternative layouts hown in Figures 10(a) and 12 
above--although some questions are raised concerning the adequacy of our proposed 
"simplest" layout in Figure 10(a). To produce the simplest layout, we simply refuse to 
cut any RST relational links until the occurrence of a photograph or a diagram forces 
us to. This yields one layout unit for the photograph of the author and associated text, 
one layout unit for the rest of the text (with a 2-column textblock layout form), and 
8 Thanks to Judy Delin for suggesting the volume control metaphor. 
436 
Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generation 
layout units for the remaining photographs and diagrams. However, given our RST 
analysis, it is then impossible to motivate the disappearance of the equipment call 
outs because the photograph is nuclear. This may either indicate that the RST analysis 
is incorrect at this point or, more likely, that the layout is not a faithful representation. 
In fact, just distributing pictures liberally around the page does not appear to yield an 
effective layout, and thus, this "simplest" rendering is in fact too simple: it no longer 
communicates the intended meaning; either the picture of the equipment has to go, 
or the individual equipment descriptions have to be reinstated. This is done in Fig- 
ure 12, where the layout divisions are similar to the original page, with two important 
exceptions: first, the RST segments \[1-6\] are maintained as a single layout unit with a 
substructure consisting of one textblock and the two photographs as referring sibling 
layout units; 9second, the RST segment \[12-31\] is maintained as a single layout unit 
without further decomposition. Finally, it should also be clear why the unacceptable 
layout shown in Figure 10(b) cannot be produced according to the translation pro- 
cedure we have described since; for example, it is not possible to accumulate such 
wildly displaced segments of the RST tree into single layout units. 
5.5 Interim Conclusion 
This section has set out a procedure for producing layout structures from rhetorical 
structures. However, the mapping remains highly nondeterministic. Further sources 
of constraint will be required before it will be possible to let the procedure simply run 
and produce layouts. Part of this indeterminacy lies in the fact that many fine-grained 
decisions in the microtypography of real publications (e.g., what typeface to select, 
whether text in a layout unit is typeset ragged or justified, etc.) are not motivated 
by the communicative-functional intentions as captured by the RST-analysis of single 
texts, but are instead fixed by higher level decisions concerning a magazine's intended 
style and feel (cf., Reichenberger t al. \[1996\] and the conclusion below for further 
discussion). Another part of the indeterminacy arises out of the fact that layout is 
genuinely very flexible. Considerably more investigation will be required before the 
parameters and limits of that flexibility are charted. Nevertheless, armed with this first 
mapping specification, we now turn to a particular application to see how it functions 
with rather simpler tasks than the world of Unihoc pages. 
6. Page Generation within the Prototype Information System 
The application scenario described in this section was a natural outgrowth of the 
Editor's Workbench (see Section 2.1), moving from its original conception as a tool 
for editors, to take on more of a role of an information system for general use. Prior 
interface-design studies investigating beneficial applications ofthe Editor's Workbench 
suggested a usage scenario in which the information system provides "overinforma- 
tive" responses to information retrieval requests. In this scenario, the user is assumed 
to be browsing rather than posing focused queries. The overinformative r sponse 
avoids burdening the user with unwanted ata by presenting the information as a 
coherently organized multimodal page: the user can quickly scan the information on 
offer in the same way as he or she would scan a newspaper or magazine page. For 
this to be effective, the layout must correctly communicate which information is cen- 
tral and which information is more peripheral--i.e., it must signal the communicative 
9 This is in fact he layout structure shown in Figure 5 above; nodes 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3, and 2.3.4 in the 
figure correspond to the RST spans \[1-6\], [12-31\]--D and E, respectively.

intentions of the page as a whole. The resulting DArtbi0 system aimed specifically at 
providing pages that present artists' biographical information: the Editor's Workbench 
domain model had already accumulated information of this kind for several thousand 
artists and so offered a solid basis for prototype construction. Finally, for something 
of a local connection, we concentrated on the Bauhaus. 
There are many aspects of the design and implementation of the complete DArtbio 
system that space precludes us giving here. Moreover, the system remains an initial 
testbed for our approach--many considerations crucial for a practical system have 
not been addressed. Our focus centers on just those aspects relevant for our claims 
concerning layout and the mechanisms by which it is realized--and even here the 
presentation will sometimes need to be schematic. The central components that are 
relevant are the automatic visualization engine (AVE: Section 2.1 and Kamps \[1998\]), 
the automatic page-layout component (APALO: Section 3), the natural anguage gen- 
erator (KOMET: Bateman and Teich \[1995\] and Bateman, Teich, and Alexa \[1998\]), and 
the very large domain model (ca. 500,000 objects) of the Editor's Workbench (Rostek, 
M6hr, and Fischer 1994). The slice through the system that we describe lies between 
the goal-driven establishment of a rhetorically structured presentation plan on the 
one hand, and the construction of a fully specified layout structure on the other. To 
achieve this transformation we apply the general mapping procedure described in the 
previous ection augmented by application-specific decision heuristics. As with most 
multimodal information systems, the terminal elements of our layout structure receive 
particular media allocations that determine the means employed for their production; 
but, in contrast o previous systems, we detail the new role played by dependency 
lattices in both media-allocation and media-coordination a d then some of the conse- 
quences of adopting a flexible rhetorical structure to layout-structure mapping. 
6.1 Abstract Page Specification 
We begin by setting up some closely related presentation plans. Our examples revolve 
around possible answers to questions art historians typically ask in discussing the 
spread of art movements: for example, How did the Bauhaus pread to the United States? 
The interaction style supported by the Editor's Workbench--and hence by its further 
incarnation as DArtbio--is described in Kamps et al (1996); users explore the database 
progressively by following proposed links. Asking for information about the Bauhaus 
retrieves, amongst other objects, the set of all artists classified as Bauhaus artists. The 
Workbench also includes preset question types for distinct ypes of object; these ques- 
tion types were established through consultation with editors expert in the domain. 
One such question for the object ype art movement is spread of influence. The domain 
knowledge representation for art history includes a range of conditions that are known 
to contribute to a spread of influence: for example, artists moving to the country be- 
ing influenced. Following the link spread of influence and cross-classifying this against a 
country, such as U.S.A., then restricts the former set of Bauhaus artists down to those 
that are known to the system to have moved to the U.S. This information then needs 
to be presented to the user. 
At this point, DArtbio must construct presentation plans. Presentation plans are 
composed by appealing to knowledge of how particular kinds of texts are structured. 
For example, biographies as a text type, or genre, have certain regularly reoccuring 
features of organization and content. The NLG component of the system, KOMET, is 
strongly genre-based: generation proceeds first and foremost by receiving a request o 
generate a text belonging to a specific genre, e.g., a biography. The linguistic details of 
the texts required are established by prior corpus studies. This use of genre as a pre- 
structuring device for texts resembles schemas as introduced into NLG by McKeown

Page presentation plan for a set of biographies with summary. Downward arrows indicate 
points of further efinement. The biographies are filled in the same way as the biography that 
is shown, following the linguistic genre constraints for biographies. The summary is filled in 
using a dependency lattice for information extraction. 
(1985), but is grounded linguistically more in notions of generic text structure (Hasan 
1996); there is also a clear relationship to domain communication knowledge (Kit- 
tredge, Korelsky, and Rambow 1991). We extended this genre-based view to include 
all of the information offerings of the DArtbio system. Presentation plans therefore be- 
gin their life as partially specified generic structures, defined as incomplete rhetorical 
structures. 
We consider two styles of presentation arising from this scenario: in the first, the 
user is simply presented with information about the list of selected artists; in the 
second, the information focuses more on the movement of those artists to the U.S. 
Both presentations use a common generic presentation style and were motivated by 
user/editor consultations within the earlier phases of the Dictionary of Art project-- 
the main information content of the communicative move is allocated to the nucleus 
of a summary rhetorical structure. The initial presentation plan is then grown further 
by recursive descent. The contents of the satellite are filled in according to the def- 
inition of summary as given below. The contents of the nucleus were provided by 
the information-retrieval request--in our first presentation plan, this is a set of artists 
combined by a joint rhetorical schema. Each of these is then expanded further: since 
the default presentational style adopted for an artist within DArtbio is the biography 
genre, the NLG component constructs a rhetorical fragment conforming to the struc- 
ture of this text type, collecting information from the domain model as required. The 
particular model of biography adopted here also includes the use of a photograph if
the Editor's Workbench domain model includes one for the artist in question. 
This results in a presentation plan of the form shown in Figure 16. While all of 
the biographies are filled in in the same way, employing standard NLG-techniques, 
the summary is more interesting. DArtbio distinguishes between two subtypes of sum- 
mary: a summary giving an overview of shared properties with varying attributes 
(summary-varying), and a summary giving an overview of shared properties only 
(summary-shared). In the current presentation plan, the former is used. Our approach 
to summaries relies heavily on the dependency lattice-mechanism; regularities are as- 
439 
Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3 
sumed to provide useful summaries of the data being presented. The information 
content of the summary is therefore produced by constructing a dependency-lattice 
of the information to be summarized--i.e., the list of propositions contained in the 
nucleus--and picking out regularities (i.e., nodes higher in the lattice). 1? Performing 
this for the information in the biographies picks out and partially orders the informa- 
tion that recurs: i.e., name, date and place of birth and death, and profession (which 
always occur), and then certain contingent aspects of education and career depending 
on the particular artists selected. The highest scoring facts are selected for inclusion 
in the summary (which may either occur immediately by some preset cut-off point or, 
more interestingly, be left for later when space constraints may determine how much 
information to give). This set of information is not organized further rhetorically. 
6.2 Determining Page Layout 
If, for the sake of concreteness, we now assume that the user has restricted his or her 
attention to a selection of just five artists: Gropius, Hilberseimer, Anni Albers, Josef 
Albers, and Breuer--again we emphasize that the names and information presented 
here are for illustrative purposes only--we can apply the layout mechanism of the pre- 
vious section to the presentation plan in order to produce a corresponding page. The 
presentation plan is much simpler than the Unihoc case and so the options are some- 
what more restricted. Beginning at the top of the plan, we may either decompose the 
plan or not. We consider the media allocations for the possible partitions, which are 
initially comprised of the nucleus to the summary as well as the satellite. The nucleus 
can only be allocated a complex medium-status ( ince it is structurally complex and 
includes subtrees with pictorial content), while the satellite can be allocated either 
text or diagram status. Given this choice, DArtbio selects diagram as preferable on 
the grounds discussed above. The members of the partition therefore receive different 
media-allocations and so a layout decomposition is introduced. The summary-satellite 
is a leaf of the presentation plan and so there is no further layout decomposition to 
be considered. The layout element is allocated a diagram-layout form and the content 
is passed on directly to the visualization component for diagram generation. 
Layout decomposition then proceeds with the nucleus, which consists of the joint 
schema. The decision is whether to stop decomposition at this point or whether to 
continue. Each member of the joint schema still has a complex medium-status and 
so our heuristics favor decomposition. The core layout mechanism does not allow us 
to break just one member of a multinuclear configuration off from the presentation 
plan and thus all the sibling biographies must be taken. This introduces a further 
five layout elements into the layout structure, each corresponding to a biography. 
Moreover, these five are linked by equivalence annotations and, because they are 
nuclear in the presentation plan, their combined weight must remain greater than that 
of the diagram. Since subtrees have now been cut from the presentation plan, the layout 
mechanism also has the option of introducing additional layout elements as headers. 
In the DArtbio case, we set up our heuristics, rather arbitrarily, to give headers to 
textblocks only; a more realistic decision-making process here can only be constructed 
after considerably more empirical investigation. Thus, since the individual biography 
layout units are still complex, we do not immediately construct a header element but 
pass this option down so that it may be picked up by the first nuclear textblock that 
10 Other, more sophisticated approaches tosummarization can, of course, be considered; moreover, it may 
not be necessary to consider all of the propositions in the nucleus. RST suggests that only nuclei need 
be considered, while Cristea, Ide, and Romary (1998) refine this further and suggest that some nuclei 
plus a specified set of their satellites (those that are vein heads) is preferable.

is encountered. The state of the layout structure following these decisions is shown 
graphically in Figure 17. 
The constraints on layout and presentation that are being accumulated in the lay- 
out structure now begin to bite, restricting possibilities for further layout-structure d - 
velopment. First, as specified by the layout mechanism, when the visualization engine 
attempts to design a diagram, it must construct a dependency lattice for the informa- 
tion that is to be expressed. It is now constrained, however, to taking the dependency 
lattice that has already been constructed for the nucleus to which the summary is con- 
nected. This guarantees that the grouping and graphical-attribute allocations deployed 
in the diagram will be consistent with the regularities observable in the information 
presented in the set of biographies. Second, when the layout structure is decomposed 
further, the equivalence r lation will require that the same layout decisions be made for 
all the biographies. This then guarantees that regardless of precise physical placement, 
the typographical message will be that these biographies have the same status. 
Decomposition of the biography layout units is straightforward. The only partition 
is in terms of the photograph and the biographical information: the medium-allocation 
of the photograph is self-selecting, and that of the biographical information is text be- 
cause of the few co-varying dimensions of information revealed by the dependency 
lattice. Therefore, the layout unit is decomposed, and the picture receives a refers to 
link. The remaining biographical information can either be grouped within another 
single layout unit, or decomposed further. Our heuristics do not bother to decompose 
when there is little content o be expressed; and as each of the satellites in the biogra- 
phy contains only a few propositions (rarely more than four with most artists in the 
Editor's Workbench knowledge base), we do not decompose further here, selecting a
single layout unit with a textblock layout form. However, since we have the option of 
inserting a header layout element from above, we discharge this here, giving a layout 
structure as shown to the left of Figure 18. A page-rendering solution for this struc- 
ture is shown in the upper right of the figure: layout elements have been mapped to 
rectangles with particular dimensions and locations on the page. The contents of the 
layout elements are produced according to the layout forms allocated: the picture is 
simply inserted (with an appropriate scaling for the layout unit as a whole); a text is 
generated by the NLG component (conforming to the generic text constraints of bi- 
ographies); and a header is selected (a domain-specific process). When these contents 
are filled in, the results is page fragments uch as that shown in the lower right of the 
figure. Similar solutions are provided for all of the biographies because of the specified 
type-equivalence.

6.3 Page Rendering: Examples 
The layout structure for the current presentation plan is now complete. An exam- 
ple of a complete generated page that renders the layout structure is shown in Fig- 
ure 19. The individual biographies are each as described above; we can see that the 
generic onstraint that a photograph of the artist be presented has not been satisfied 
in all cases, but this does not affect the general ayout forms applied to the set as 
a whole. More significantly, the regularities expressed in the diagram are precisely 
the regularities that are expressed in the text parts of the biographies. The diagram 
picks out artists as the basic graphical elements and allocates to these elements at- 
tributes of color (for profession) and extent (for lifespan). In addition, time and place 
of birth and death are added as icon graphical attributes, again color coded. Confor- 
mity and consistency in design has therefore been achieved for the page as a whole 
even when there are minor deviations in available information in some of the page 
elements. 
The layout process is very flexible in terms of the solutions that it pursues. The 
apparent resemblance of the page to a grid-based layout is in fact simply a by-product 
of the constraint-resolution process and its attempt o fit 7 boxes (the 5 biography 
layout units, the diagram, and the diagram's key) into a limited space. For compari- 
son, some other solutions offered by the layout process are shown in the alternative 
thumbnail ayouts of Figure 20. These give a graphical sense of the notion of layout 
unit: we can see that layout units are maintained as persistent visual groupings re- 
gardless of their precise placement. Since all of the top-level layout units are siblings 
in the layout structure, the layout process must also work to avoid suggesting any 
grouping among them. This is achieved by spreading the units evenly over the page 
as a whole. 
The co-ordination of text, diagram, and layout demonstrated in the Figure 19 
can be further illustrated very briefly by considering our second presentation plan:

here, the main nucleus of the generic rhetorical structure is not a set of artists but 
instead a set of propositions, each describing the movement o the U.S. and subsequent 
professional activity of an artist; such facts are readily retrieved from the Editor's 
Workbench knowledge base and result in relations of the form (cf., Kamps et al [1996]):

Page generation with this information can proceed in exactly the same way as for 
the previous example. There is, however, less information under the main nucleus, as 
there are no longer full biographies to generate but rather text elements of the form: 
Albers settled in the USA in 1933. In 1933-1949 she taught at Black 
Mountain College in North Carolina. 
These may be allocated either to distinct layout units as in the previous example 
which would distribute them about the page as shown--or to a single layout unit 
as a textblock, in which case the aggregations illustrated in Section 2.2 apply. When, 
however, the summary is produced, the visualization component receives a very dif- 
ferent dependency lattice than that used for the diagram in the previous example, one 
that is almost identical to that used as an example in Section 2.1 above. The diagram 
produced in this case is therefore also quite different and focuses instead on the reg- 
ularities of teaching (i.e., profession, workperiod, and school), as shown in Figure 4. 
The text and diagram are therefore again appropriately coordinated. 
6.4 Summary 
The DArtbio prototype can produce similar pages to the one shown in Figure 19 for 
any set of artists selected by the user in the course of interaction with the system. The 
presentation environment is implemented in Smalltalk, the visualization and layout 
engines in C, and the text generation component in Common Lisp; page generation is
in real-time. The overanswering present in any page is balanced by the use of a page 
to set out the information in a way that does not commit he user to reading it all. 
The layout process is flexible within the limits that are compatible with the goal of 
presenting a fixed amount of information on a page, but would require substantially 
more work to be sufficiently robust for a real-world system. The question of evalua- 
tion has not, therefore, been relevant: sufficiently fine-grained heuristics are in place 
to prevent layout disasters, but considerably more empirical work is now required 
in order to generalize these heuristics across differing domains and iffering target 
document types. 
7. Conclusions and Outlook 
In this paper we have argued that many of the decisions that need to be made for 
an effective diagram are also found in the construction of an effective text. Making 
both sets of decisions dependent on a single, shared representation f regularities in 
a dataset provides a straightforward way of achieving consistency in the perspec- 
444 
Bateman, Karnps, Kleinz and Reichenberger Constructive Page Generation 
tives presented in the differing media: diagrams and texts then mutually reinforce 
one another by applying common information groupings. We have also argued that 
a message is provided by the physical layout of information on a page: relations 
of similarity, difference, and connection are commonly expressed by layout. In de- 
signing a page, therefore, layout relations must be made consistent with the overall 
communicative intent of the page. We have shown how consistency between layout 
and communicative intent can be achieved by deriving the former (layout structure) 
from a representation f the latter (rhetorically organized presentation plan). We have 
discussed both how such a derivation can be motivated and how it can be used for 
automatic page generation. 
Our study of the relationship between the communicative structure of a page of in- 
formation and the coherent layout of that information demonstrates that layout needs 
to be treated as an integral and complex part of the overall generation process; it can in 
no way be treated as a final piece of postprocessing. Many of the decisions required for 
segmenting a text effectively (e.g., into thematic paragraphs, into rhetorically related 
segments, etc.) also have correlates in the decisions that produce a coherent layout 
structure. This entails several areas of trade-off between layout and text: segmentation 
and grouping information may be expressed in language, in layout, or in some mixture 
of the two. By treating language xpressions and layout as arising ultimately from a 
common source, we expect hat potentially costly constraint-resolution at a local level 
(i.e., between arbitrary segments) can be avoided, or reduced, by enforcing consistent 
layout-language d cisions for the layout structure of a page as a whole. 
The last five years have seen rapid growth in the awareness of the importance 
of consistent and functional style selections: notions of style sheets from professional 
publishing have made their way into the mainstream of web-based ocument design-- 
including consistent presentation formatting using Cascaded Style Sheets and flexible 
document rendering using, for example, the Document Style Semantics and Specifi- 
cation Language (DSSSL, ISO/IEC 10179) and the Extensible Stylesheet Language's 
Formatting Objects (XSL:FO; W3C). Professional bodies concerned with the closely 
related theme of Information Design--the application of processes of design (that is, plan- 
ning) to the communication ofinformation (its content and language as well as its form) (Waller 
1996)--have also grown considerably both in number and membership. Moreover, 
the importance of some notion of rhetoric for professional design and layout is in- 
creasingly accepted (cf., Schriver \[1996\]). Less clear in such work is precisely how to 
characterize and teach useful notions of rhetoric. Our work on the rhetorical basis of 
layout interfaces directly with these developments, and establishes a new bridge be- 
tween options for consistent microtypography at one end, right through to high-level 
communicative goal-based text design at the other. 
Concretely, our work has highlighted the importance of further rounds of de- 
tailed empirical investigation, interlocked with critical evaluation. Our general mech- 
anism for assigning the material of a rhetorical structure to a layout is highly non- 
deterministic--at virtually all points we need to appeal to heuristics to make a final 
decision. Our investigations so far indicate, however, that this is not a weakness in our 
formulation: the nondeterminism arises instead from the fact that the layout process is 
just as flexible as we describe it. The further restriction of the process o as to produce 
"appropriate" layouts can only proceed by establishing more motivated heuristics-- 
and these heuristics will depend crucially on the particular applications, document 
types, target audiences, and informational content concerned. The rather heteroge- 
neous set of heuristics currently adopted withIn the DArtbio system, for example, will 
need to be replaced by a framework of empirically motivated constraints; some of 
this work has now been started (Bateman, Delin, and Allen 2000; Delin, Bateman, and 
445 
Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 3 
Allen, forthcoming). The layouts produced will then need detailed evaluation--both 
from design experts and from users--as Schriver et al (1996) should be the case for 
human-designed documents. Only in this way will it be possible to start refining the 
model of layout we have developed so as to even begin to cover the diversity and 
flexibility of layouts observable in professionally produced documents.
