Abstract
Many verbal jokes, like garden path sen-
tences, pose difficulties to models of dis-
course since the initially primed interpre-
tation needs to be discarded and a new one
created based on subsequent statements.
The effect of the joke depends on the
fact that the second (correct) interpretation
was not visible earlier. Existing models
of discourse semantics in principle gen-
erate all interpretations of discourse frag-
ments and carry these until contradicted,
and thus the dissonance criteria in humour
cannot be met. Computationally, main-
taining all possible worlds in a discourse
is very inefficient, thus computing only the
maximum-likelihood interpretation seems
to be a more efficient choice on average.
In this work we outline a probabilistic
lexicon based lexical semantics approach
which seems to be a reasonable construct
for discourse in general and use some ex-
amples from humour to demonstrate its
working.
1 Introduction
Consider the following :
(1) I still miss my ex-wife, but my aim is
improving.
(2) The horse raced past the barn fell.
In a discourse structure common to many jokes,
the first part of (1) has a default set of interpre-
tations, say P1, for which no consistent interpre-
tation can be found when the second part of the
joke is uttered. After a search, the listener reaches

the possible world P1 where miss is taken in an
emotional sense. After encountering the word aim
this is destroyed and eventually a new world P2
arises where miss is taken in the physical sense.
the alternate set of interpretations P2 (Figure 1).
A similar process holds for garden path sentences
such as (2), where the default interpretation cre-
ated in the first part (upto the word barn) has to be
discarded when the last part is heard. The search
involved in identifying the second interpretation
is an important indicator of human communica-
tion, and linguistic impairment such as autism of-
ten leads to difficulty in identifying jokes.
Yet, this aspect of discourse is not sufficiently
emphasized in most computational work. Cog-
nitively, this is a form of dissonance, a violation
of expectation. However, unlike some forms of
dissonance which may be constructive, leading to
metaphoric or implicature shifts, where part of the
original interpretation may be retained, these dis-
course structures are destructive, and the origi-
nal interpretation has to be completely abandoned,
and a new one searched out (Figure 2). Often
this is because the default interpretation involves
a sense-association that has very high coherence
in the immediate context, but is nullified by later

utterances.
While humour may involve a number of other
mechanisms such as allusion or stereotypes (Shi-
bles, 1989; Gruner, 1997), a wide class of ver-
bal humour exhibits destructive dissonance. For
a joke to work, the resulting interpretation must
result in an incongruity, what (Freud, 1960) calls
an ?energy release? that breaks the painful barriers
we have around forbidden thoughts.
Part of the difficulty in dealing with such shifts
is that it requires a rich model of discourse se-
mantics. Computational theories such as the
General Theory of Verbal Humour (Attardo and
Raskin, 1991) have avoided this difficult prob-
lem by adopting extra-linguistic knowledge in the
form of scripts, which encode different opposi-
tions that may arise in jokes. Others (Minsky,
1986) posit a general mechanism without con-
sidering specifics. Other models in computation
have attempted to generate jokes using templates
(Attardo and Raskin, 1994; Binsted and Ritchie,
1997) or recognize jokes using machine learning
models (Mihalcea and Strapparava, 2005).
Computationally, the fact that other less likely
interpretations such as P2 are not visible initially,
may also result in considerably efficiency in more
common situations, where ambiguities are not
generated to begin with. For example, in joke
(1) the interpretation after reading the first clause,
has the word miss referring to the abstract act of
missing a dear person. After hearing the punch
line, somewhere around the word aim, (the trigger
point TP ), we have to revise our interpretation to
one where miss is used in a physical sense, as in
shooting a target. Then, the forbidden idea of hurt-
ing ex-wives generates the humour. By hiding this
meaning, the mechanism of destructive dissonance
enables the surprise which is the crux of the joke.
In the model proposed here, no extra-linguistic
sources of knowledge are appealed to. Lexical
Semantics proposes rich inter-relations encoding
knowledge within the lexicon itself (Pustejovksy,
1995; Jackendoff, 1990), and this work consid-
ers the possibility that such lexicons may eventu-
ally be able to carry discourse interpretations as
well, to the level of handling situations such as the
destructive transition from a possible-world P1 to
possible world P2. Clearly, a desideratum in such
a system would be that P1 would be the preferred
interpretation from the outset, so much so that P2,
which is in principle compatible with the joke, is
not even visible in the first part of the joke. It
would be reasonable to assume that such an inter-
pretation may be constructed as a ?Winner Take
All? measure using probabilistic inter-relations in
the lexicon, built up based on usage frequencies.
This would differ from existing theories of dis-
course in several ways, as will be illustrated in the
following sections.
2 Models of Discourse
Formal semantics (Montague, 1973) looked at log-
ical structures, but it became evident that lan-
guage builds up on what is seemingly semantic
incompatibility, particularly in Gricean Implica-
ture (Grice, 1981). It became necessary to look
at the relations that describe interactions between
such structures. (Hobbs, 1985) introduces an early
theory of discourse and the notion of coherence
relations, which are applied recursively on dis-
course segments. Coherence relations, such as
Elaboration, Explanation and Contrast, are rela-
tions between discourse units that bind segments
of text into one global structure. (Grosz and Sid-
ner, 1986) incorporates two more important no-
tions into its model - the idea of intention and fo-
cus. The Rhetorical Structure Theory, introduced
in (Mann and Thompson, 1987), binds text spans
with rhetorical relations, which are discourse con-
nectives similar to coherence relations.
The Discourse Representation Theory (DRT)
(Kamp, 1984) computes inter-sentential anaphora
and attempts to maintain text cohesion through
sets of predicates, termed Discourse Representa-
tion Structures (DRSs), that represent discourse
32

units. A Principal DRS accumulates information
contained in the text, and forms the basis for re-
solving anaphora and discourse referents.
By marrying DRT to a rich set of rhetorical
relations, Segmented Discourse Representation
Theory (SDRT) (Lascarides and Asher, 2001)
attempts to to create a dynamic framework that
tries to bridge the semantic-pragmatic interface.
It consists of three components - Underspecified
Logical Formulae (ULF), Rhetorical Relations
and Glue Logic. Semantic representation in
the ULF acts as an interface to other levels.
Information in discourse units is represented by
a modified version of DRS, called Segmented
Discourse Representation Structures (SDRSs).
SDRSs are connected through rhetorical relations,
which posit relationships on SDRSs to bind them.
To illustrate, consider the discourse in (3):
(3) Who supports Gorbachev? No one does,
he can still walk by himself!
The rhetorical relations over the discourse are
shown in Figure 3. Here, Explanation induces
subordination and implies that the content of the
subordinate SDRSs work on further qualifying the
principal SDRS, while Question-Answer Pair in-
duces coordination. Rhetorical relations thus con-
nect semantic units together to formalize the flow
in a discourse. SDRT?s Glue Logic then runs se-
quentially on the ULF and rhetorical relations to
reduce underspecification and disambiguation and
derive inferences through the discourse. The way
inferencing is done is similar to DRT, with the ad-
ditional constraints that rhetorical relations spec-
ify.
A point to note is SDRT?s Maximum Dis-
course Coherence (MDC) Principle. This princi-
ple is used to resolve ambiguity in interpretation
by maximizing discourse coherence to obtain the
Pragmatically Preferred interpretation. There are
three conditions on which MDC works: (a) The
more rhetorical relations there are between two
units, the more coherent the discourse. (b) The
more anaphorae that are resolved, the more coher-
ent the discourse. (c) Some rhetorical relations
can be measured for coherence as well. For ex-
ample, the coherence of Contrast depends on how
dissimilar its connected prepositions are. SDRT
uses rhetorical relations and MDC to resolve lex-
ical and semantic ambiguities. For example, in
the utterance ?John bought an apartment. But he
rented it?, the sense of rented is that of renting
out, and that is resolved in SDRT because the word
but cues the relation Contrast, which prefers an in-
terpretation that maximizes semantic contrast be-
tween its connectives.
Glue logic works by iteratively extracting sub-
sets of inferences through the flow of the dis-
course. This is discussed in more detail later.
2.1 Lexicons for Discourse modeling
Pustejovsky?s Generative Lexicon (GL) model
(Pustejovksy, 1995) outlines an ambitious attempt
to formulate a lexical semantics framework that
can handle the unboundedness of linguistic ex-
pressions by providing a rich semantic structure,
a principled ontology of concepts (called qualia),
and a set of generative devices in which partici-
pants in a phrase or sentence can influence each
other?s semantic properties.
The ontology of concepts in GL is hierarchi-
cal, and concepts that exhibit similar behaviour
are grouped together into subsystems called Lexi-
cal Conceptual Paradigms (LCP). As an example,
the GL structure for door is an LCP that represents
both the use of door as a physical object such as in
?he knocked on the door?, as well as an aperture
like in ?he entered the door?.
In this work, we extend the GL structures to in-
corporate likelihood measures in the ontology and
the event structure relations. The Probabilistic
Qualia Structure, which outlines the ontological
hierarchy of a lexical item, also encodes frequency
information. Every time the target word appears
together with an ontologically connected concept,
the corresponding qualia features are strength-
ened. This results in a probabilistic model of
qualia features, which can in principle determine
33
that a book has read as its maximally likely telic
role, but that in the context of the agent being the
author, write becomes more likely.
Generative mechanisms work on this semantic
structure to capture systematic polysemy in terms
of type shifts. Thus Type Coercion enforces se-
mantic constraints on the arguments of a predicate.
For example, ?He enjoyed the book? is coerced to
?He enjoyed reading the book? since enjoy requires
an activity, which is taken as the telic role of the
argument, i.e. that of book. Co-composition con-
strains the type-shifting of the predicate by its ar-
guments. An example is the difference between
?bake a cake? (creating a new object) versus ?bake
beans? (state change). Finally, Selective Binding
type-shifts a modifier based on the head. For ex-
ample, in ?old man? and ?old book?, the property
being modified by old is shifted from physical-age
to information-recency.
To accommodate for likelihoods in generative
mechanisms, we need to incorporate conditional
probabilities between the lexical and ontological
entries that the mechanisms work on. These prob-
abilities can be stored within the lexicon itself or
integrated into the generative mechanisms. In ei-
ther case, mechanisms like Type Coercion should
no longer exhibit a default behaviour - the coer-
cion must change based on frequency of occur-
rence and context.
3 The Analysis of Humour
The General Theory of Verbal Humour (GTVH),
introduced earlier, is a well-known computational
model of humour. It uses the notion of scripts
to account for the opposition in jokes. It models
humour as two opposing and overlapping scripts
put together in a discourse, one of which is
apparent and the other hidden from the reader till
a trigger point, when the hidden script suddenly
surfaces, generating humour. However, the notion
of scripts implies that there is a script for every
occasion, which severely limits the theory. On the
other hand, models of discourse are more general
and do not require scripts. However, they lack the
mechanism needed to capture such oppositions.
In addition to joke (3), consider:
(4) Two guys walked into a bar. The third
one ducked.
The humour in joke (4) results from the polyse-
mous use of the word bar. The first sentence leads
us to believe that bar is a place where one drinks,
but the second sentence forces us to revise our in-
terpretation to mean a solid object. GTVH would
use the DRINKING BAR script before the trigger
and the COLLISION script after. Joke (3), quoted
in Raskin?s work as well, contains an obvious op-
position. The first sentence invokes the sense of
support being that of political support. The second
sentence introduces the opposition, and the mean-
ing of support is changed to that of physical sup-
port.
In all examples discussed so far, the key
observations are that (i) a single inference is
primed by the reader, (ii) this primary inference
suppresses other inferences until (iii) a trigger
point is reached.
To formalize the unfolding of a joke, we re-
fer back to Figure 1. Let t be a point along the
timeline. When t < TP , both P1 and P2 are com-
patible, and the possible world is P = P1 ? P2.
P1 is the preferred interpretation and P2 is hidden.
When t = TP , J2 is introduced, and P1 becomes
incompatible with P2, and P1 may also lose
compatibility with J2. P2 now surfaces as the
preferred inference. The reader has to invoke a
search to find P2, which is represented by the
search gap.
A possible world Pi = {qi1, qi2, . . . , qik}
where qmn is an inference. Two worlds Pi and Pj
are incompatible if there exists any pair of sets of
inferences whose intersection is a contradiction.
i.e.
Pi is said to be incompatible with
Pj iff ? {qi1, qi2, . . . , qik} ? Pi ?
?{qj1, qj2, . . . , qjl} ? Pj such that
{qi1 ? qi2 ? . . . qik ? qj1 ? qj2 ? . . . qjl} ? F .
They are said to be compatible if no such subsets
exist.
We now explore in detail why compositional
discourse models fail to handle the mechanisms of
humour.
3.1 Beyond Scripts - Why Verbal Humour
Should Be Winner Take All
An argument against the approach of existing dis-
course models like SDRT concerns their iterative
inferencing. At each point in the process of infer-
34
encing, SDRT?s Glue Logic carries over all inter-
pretations possible within its constraints as a set.
MDC ranks contending inferences, allowing less
preferred inferences to be discarded, and the result
of this process is a subset of the input to it. Con-
trasting inferences can coexist through underspec-
ification, and the contrast is resolved when one of
them loses compatibility. This is cognitively un-
likely; (Miller, 1956) has shown that the human
brain actively retains only around seven units of
information. With such a limited working mem-
ory, it is not cognitively feasible to model dis-
course analysis in this manner. Cognitive models
working with limited-capacity short-term memory
like in (Lewis, 1996) support the same intuition.
Thus, a better approach would be a Winner Take
All (WTA) approach, where the most likely inter-
pretation, called the winner, suppresses all other
interpretations as we move through the discourse.
The model must be revised to reflect new contexts
if they are incompatible with the existing model.
Let us now explore this with respect to joke
(3). There is a Question-Answer relation between
the first sentence and the next two. The semantic
representation for the first sentence alone is:
?x(support(x,Gorbachev)), x =?
The x =? indicates a missing referent for
who. Using GL, it is not difficult to resolve the
sense of support to mean that of political support.
To elaborate, the lexical entry of Gorbachev
is an LCP of two senses - that of the head of
government and that of an animate, as shown:
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
Gorbachev
ARGSTR =
[
ARG1 =x: man
ARG2 =y: head of govt
D-ARG3 =z: community
]
QUALIA =
[
human.president lcp
FORMAL = p(x, y)
TELIC = govern(y, z)
]
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
The two senses of support applicable in this
context are that of physical support and of political
support. We use abstract support as a generaliza-
tion of the political sense. The analysis of the first
sentence alone would allow for both these possi-
bilities:
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
supportabs
ARGSTR =
[
ARG1 =x: animate
ARG2 =y: abstract entity
]
EVENTSTR =
[
E1 = e1 : process
]
QUALIA =
[
FORMAL = supportabs act(e1, x, y)
AGENTIVE =...
]
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
supportphy
ARGSTR =
[
ARG1 =x: physical entity
ARG2 =y: physical entity
]
EVENTSTR =
[
E1 = e1 : process
]
QUALIA =
[
FORMAL = supportphy act(e1, x, y)
AGENTIVE =...
]
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
Thus, after the first sentence, the sense of
support includes both senses, i.e. support ?
{supportabs, supportphy}.
We then come across the second sentence and
establish the semantic representation for it, as
well as establish rhetorical relations. We find
that the sentence contains walk(z). SDRT?s
Right Frontier Rule resolves the referent he to
Gorbachev. Also, the clause ?no one does?
resolves the referent x to null. Thus, we get:
walk(Gorbachev) ? support(null,Gorbachev)
Now consider the lexical entry for walk:
?
?
?
?
?
walk
ARGSTR =
[
ARG1 =x: animate
]
EVENTSTR =
[
E1 = e1 : process
]
QUALIA =
[
FORMAL = walk act(e1, x)
AGENTIVE = walk begin(e1, x)
]
?
?
?
?
?
The action walk requires an animate argument.
Since walk(Gorbachev) is true, the sense of sup-
port in the previous sentence is restricted to mean
physical support, i.e. support = supportphy,
since only supportphy can take an animate argu-
ment as its object - the abstract entity require-
ment of supportabs causes it to be ruled out, end-
ing at a final inference.
The change of sense for support is key to the
generation of humour, but SDRT fails to recog-
nize the shift since it neither has any priming
mechanism nor revision of models built into it.
It merely works by restricting the possible infer-
ences as more information becomes available. Re-
ferring to Figure 1 again, SDRT will only account
for the refinement of possible worlds from P1?P2
to P2. It will not be able to account for the priming
of either Pi, which is required.
4 A Probabilistic Semantic Lexicon
We now introduce a WTA model under which
priming could be well accounted for. We would
like a model under which a single interpretation is
made at each point in the analysis. We want a set
35
of possible worlds P such that:
J1 ??WTA P =
{p : p is a world consistent with J1}
WTA ensures that only the prime world P is
chosen by J1. When J2 is analyzed, no world
p ? P can satisfy J2, i.e:
?p ? P,?J2 ?? p
In this case, we need to backtrack and find
another set P ? that satisfies both J1 and J2, i.e:
(J1, J2) ??WTA P ?
In Figure 1, P = P1 and P ? = P2.
The most appropriate way to achieve this is
to include the priming in the lexicon itself. We
present a lexical structure where senses of com-
positional units are attributed with a probability of
occurrence approximated by its frequency count.
The probability of a composition can then be cal-
culated from the individual probabilities. The
highest probability is primed. Thus, at every point
in the discourse, only one inference emerges as
primary and suppresses all other inferences. As
an example, the proposed structure for Gorbachev
is presented below:
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
Gorbachev
ARGSTR =
[
ARG1 =x: man
ARG2 =y: head of govt
D-ARG3 =z: community
]
QUALIA =
?
?
?
FORMAL = p(x, y)
p(man) = p1
p(head_of_govt) = p2
...
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
?
Instead of using the concept of an LCP as in
classical GL, we assign probabilities to each sense
encountered. These probabilities can then facili-
tate priming.
To add weight to the argument with empirical
data, we use WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), built on
the British National Corpus, as an approximation
for frequency counts. We find that
P (supportabs) = 0.59 and
P (supportphy) = 0.36.
Similarly, for the notion of Gorbachev, it is
plausible to assume that Gorbachev as head of
government is more meaningful for most of us,
rather than just another old man. In order to make
an inference after the first sentence, we need to
search for the correct interpretation, i.e. we need
to find argmaxi,j(P (supporti/Gorbachevj)),
which intuitively should be
P (supportabs/head of govt). Making a
similar analysis as in the previous section,
the second sentence should violate the first
assumption, since walk(Gorbachev) can-
not be true (since P (abstract entity) = 0).
Thus, we need to revise our inference, mov-
ing back to the first sentence and choosing
max(P (supporti/Gorbachevj)) that is compati-
ble with the second sentence. This turns out to be
P (supportphy/animate). Thus, the distinct shift
between inferences is captured in the course of
analysis. Cognitive studies such as the studies on
Garden Path Sentences strengthen this approach
to analysis. (Lewis, 1996), for example, presents
a model that predicts cognitive observations with
very limited working memory.
Storing the inter-lexical conditional proba-
bilities is also an issue, as mentioned ear-
lier. Where, for example, do we store
P (supporti/Gorbachevj)? One possible ap-
proach would be to store them with either lexical
item. A better approach would be to bestow the re-
sponsibility of calculating these probabilities upon
the generative mechanisms of the semantic lexicon
whenever possible.
Let us now analyze joke (1) under the prob-
abilistic framework. Again, approximations for
probability of occurrence will be taken from
WordNet. The entry for wife in WordNet lists just
one sense, and so we assign a probability of 1 to it
in its lexical entry:
?
?
?
?
?
?
wife
ARGSTR =
[
ARG1 =x: woman
D-ARG2 =y: man
]
QUALIA =
[
FORMAL = husband(x) = y
AGENTIVE = marriage(x, y)
p(woman) = 1
]
?
?
?
?
?
?
The humour is generated due to the lexical am-
biguity of miss. We list the lexical entries of the
two senses of miss that apply in this context - the
first being an abstract emotional state and the other
being a physical process.

The Rhetorical Relations for joke (1) are
presented in Figure 4. After parsing the first
sentence, the logical representation obtained is:
?e1?e2?e3?x?y(wife(e1, x, y) ?
divorce(e2, x, y)?miss(e3, x, y)?e1 < e2 < e3)
To arrive at a prime inference, note that the
semantic types of the arguments of both
senses of miss are exclusive, and hence
P (physical entity/missphy) = 1 and
P (entity/missabs) = 1. Thus, using Bayes
Theorem, to compare P (missabs/entity) and
P (missphy/physical entity), it is sufficient to
compare P (missabs) and P (missphy). From
WordNet,
P (missabs) = 0.22 and
P (missphy) = 0.06.
Thus, the primed inference has miss =
missabs. The second sentence has the following
logical representation:
?x(?goodness(aim(x)) > 0)
This simply means that a measure of the
aim, called goodness, is undergoing a positive
change. The word but is a cue for a Contrast
relation between the two sentences, while the
discourse suggests Parallelism. The two senses of
aim compatible with the first sentence are aimabs,
which is synonymous to goal, and aimphy,
referring to the physical sense of missing. We
now need to consider P (aimabs/missabs) and
P (aimphy/missphy). The semantic constraints
of the rhetorical relation Contrast ensures that
the second is more coherent, i.e. it is more
probable that the contrast of physical aim get-
ting better is more coherent with the physical
sense of miss, and we expect this to be re-
flected in usage frequency as well. Therefore
P (aimabs/missabs) < P (aimphy/missphy),
and we need to shift our inference and make
miss = missphy.
As a final assertion of the probabilistic ap-
proach, consider:
(5) You can lead a child to college, but you
cannot make him think.
The incongruity in joke (5) does not result from
a syntactical or semantic ambiguity at all, and yet
it induces dissonance. The dissonance is not a
result of compositionality, but due to the access
of a whole linguistic structure, i.e. we recall the
familiar proverb ?You can lead a horse to water
but you cannot make it drink?, and the deviation
from the recognizable structure causes the viola-
tion of our expectations. Thus, access is not re-
stricted to the lexical level; we seem to store and
access bigger units of discourse if encountered fre-
quently enough. The only way to do justice to this
joke would be to encode the entire sentential struc-
ture directly into the lexicon. Our model will now
also consider these larger chunks, whose meaning
is specified atomically. The dissonance will now
come from the semantic difference between the
accessed expression and the one under analysis.
5 Conclusion
We have examined the mechanisms behind verbal
humour and shown how existing discourse mod-
els are inadequate at capturing the mechanisms
of humour. We have proposed a probabilistic
37
WTA model based on lexical frequency distribu-
tions that is more capable at handling humour, and
is based on the notion of expectation and disso-
nance.
It would be interesting now to find necessary
and sufficient conditions under this framework for
humour to be generated. Although the above
framework can identify incongruity in humour dis-
course, the same mechanisms are used and indeed
are often integral to other forms of literature. Po-
ems, for example, often rely on such mechanisms.
Are Freudian thoughts the key to separating hu-
mour from the rest, or is it a result of the inten-
tional misleading done by the speaker of a joke?
Also, it would be very interesting to find an empir-
ical link between the extent of incongruity in jokes
in our framework and the way people respond to
them.
Finally, a very interesting question is the acqui-
sition of the lexicon under such a model. How are
lexical semantic models learned by the language
acquirer probabilistically? An exploration of the
question might result in a cognitively sound com-
putational model for acquisition.
