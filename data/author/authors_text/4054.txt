ABSTRACT
In recent years, a lot of work has been done in the eld of
Topic Tracking. The focus of this work has been on iden-
tifying stories belonging to the same topic. This might re-
sult in a very large number of stories being reported to the
user. It might be more useful to a user if a summary of the
main events in the topic rather than the entire collection of
stories related to the topic were presented. Though work
on such a ne-grained level has been started, there is cur-
rently no standard evaluation testbed available to measure
the accuracy of such techniques. We describe a scheme for
developing a testbed of user judgments which can be used
to evaluate the above mentioned techniques. The corpus
that we have created can also be used to evaluate single or
multi-document summaries.
1. THE PROBLEM
In recent years, a lot of progress has been made in the
eld of Topic Tracking ([2], [3], [8], etc). The focus of this
work has been on identifying news stories belonging to the
same topic. This might result in a very large number of
stories being reported to the user. It would be more useful
to a user if a summary of the main events/developments in
the topic rather than the entire collection of stories related
to the topic were presented. We can formulate the problem
as follows.
We are given a stream of chronologically ordered and top-
ically related stories. We strive to identify the shifts in the
topic which represent the developments within the topic.
For example, consider the topic \2000 Presidential Elec-
tions". On the night of November 7, there were reports of
Gore conceding defeat to Bush. The next morning, there
were reports claiming his retraction of the previous conces-
sion. Most of the stories on the next day would also contain
old information including details of Gore's rst phone call
to Bush. We want to present only the new development
(i.e., Gore's retraction) on the next day.
.
We assume that sentence extracts can identify such topic
shifts. At the very least, they can convey enough informa-
tion to a user to keep track of the developments within that
topic. For example, in Figure 1, the mappings indicate how
the sentences in a story correspond to events.
Human judgments are required to evaluate accuracy of
extracts. The approach usually taken is to have each such
extract evaluated by human beings but such a process is ex-
pensive and time consuming. We need an evaluation corpus
similar to the TDT or TREC corpora that can be used over
and over again to do such evaluations automatically. We
propose a new scheme for building such a corpus.
Summarization evaluation is di?cult because summaries
can be created for a range of purposes. The Tipster SUM-
MAC evaluation [7] required human assessors to evaluate
each summary, and most other evaluations have also re-
quired human checking of every summary [6]. There are
others who have attempted automatic evaluations ([5], [9])
but none of these evaluation schemes captures all the desir-
able properties in a summary.
The particular problem of summarizing shifts in a news
topic was attacked slightly dierently at a Summer 1999
workshop on Novelty Detection [4]. Those eorts towards
\new information detection" were a dead end because the
granularity of new information was too small, e.g., a men-
tion of a person's age might count as new information even
when it is not the focus of the story. Swan and Allan also
created an event-level summary \timeline" ([10], [11]) but
they did not develop any evaluation corpus for their work.
This paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we dis-
cuss the desirable properties of such an evaluation corpus.
Section 3 discusses the entire annotation process, as well
as the interesting practical issues, the problems faced and
then the statistics of the corpus that we have built. Finally,
in Section 4, we discuss one possible way of utilising this
corpus.
2. DESIRABLE PROPERTIES OF THE
EVALUATION CORPUS
Any evaluation corpus of sentence extracts and events
which is to be used for the purpose of evaluating summaries
of topic shifts in a news stream should have the following
properties:
 It should be possible to identify all new events on a
periodic basis. This would be required to estimate the
recall of a system.
The Navy has ordered the discharge of sailor Timothy Mcveigh 
after he described himself gay in his America online user profile.
Civil rights groups and gay campaigners are outraged.

user profile.
He did not use his full name or say he was in the Navy, referring
to himself only as "Tim of Honolulu".
The Navy?s personnel department says that?s violation of the 
Clinton administration?s Don?t ask/Don?t tell policy of Homo-
sexuals in the military and Mcveigh has been dismissed.
Many people are upset that the Navy asked aol for information
about the supposedly anonymous user and, a Naval investigat-
or says, the online service provided it.
Gay rights groups say it?s discrimination.
Privacy advocates say it?s a breach of confidentiality.

 It should be possible to quantify the precision of a
summary, i.e., it should be possible to nd the pro-
portion of relevant sentences in the summary,
 It should be possible to identify redundancy in the
system output being evaluated. There should be some
way of assigning a marginal utility to sentences con-
taining relevant but redundant information
 It should be possible to quantify the \usefulness" of
a summary taking recall, precision as well as redun-
dancy into account.
 Sentence boundaries should be uniquely identied
(though they need not be perfect) because the aim
of the system is to identify the relevant portions in
the summary.
3. BUILDING AN EVALUATION CORPUS
3.1 The annotation process
We collect a stream of stories related to a certain topic
from the TDT-2 corpus of stories from January 1 to June
30 1998. We used stories that were judged \on-topic" by
annotators from LDC. The topics were selected from the
TDT 1998 and 1999 evaluations. The stories are parsed to
obtain sentence boundaries and all the sentences are given
unique identiers. We proceed with collecting the human
judgments in the following four steps.
1. Each judge reads all the stories and identies the im-
portant events.
2. The judges sit together to merge the events identied
by them, to form a single list of events for that topic.
All the events are given unique identiers.
3. Each judge goes through the stories again, connecting
sentences to the relevant events. Obviously, not all
sentences need to be related to any event. However,
if some sentence is relevant to more than one event, it
is linked to all those events.
4. Another judge now veries the mapping between the
sentences and the events. This gives us the nal map-
ping from sentences to events.
This way we obtain all the events mentioned within a
story and we can also nd out the events which nd their
rst mention within this story. The advantage of building
the evaluation corpus in this way is that these judgments
can be used both for summarizing topic shifts as well as
summarizing any given story by itself.
We have built a user interface in Java to allow judges to do
the above work systematically. Figure 2 shows a snapshot
of the interface used by the judges.
3.2 Statistics of the judgments obtained
We have obtained judgments for 22 topics. Three judges
worked on each topic. We summarize the results of the
annotation process for a subset of the topics in Table 1.
We dene the interjudge agreement for an event to be the
ratio of the number of sentences linked to that event, as
agreed upon by the third judge, to the number of sentences
in the union of the sentences individually marked by the
rst two judges for that event. For a topic, the interjudge
agreement is dened to be the average of the agreement for
all the events in that topic. It is to be noted that the Kappa
statistic is not applicable here in any standard form.
We found a large variance in the number of sentences
linked to dierent events. As an example, in Table 2, we
show the statistics for a group of news stories describing
Figure 2: A snapshot of the user interface used for annotating the topics

Average 39.75 12.75 2.88 0.86
Table 1: Annotation statistics for some of the topics
the damage due to tornados in Florida. We see that event 5
(\Relief agencies needed more than $300,000 to provide re-
lief") is linked to 4 sentences while event 1 (\At least 40 peo-
ple died in Florida due to 10-15 tornados.") is linked to 43
sentences. We may be able to use the number of sentences
linked to a event as an indicator of the weight/importance
of the event.
We have divided our corpus into two parts - one each for
training and testing respectively. Each part consists of 11
topics. Care was taken to ensure that both the parts had
topics of roughly the same size and time of occurrence. The
statistics of both parts of the corpus are given in Table 3.
3.3 Problems faced
 Sometimes our sentence parser broke up a valid sen-
tence into multiple parts. One judge linked only the

relevant part of the sentence to the corresponding
event while another linked all the parts to that event.
This happened in the case of three of the topics (top-
ics 20031, 20042 and 20057) before we detected the
problem.
 Sometimes when similar sentences occur in dierent
stories, one of the judges neglected the later occur-
rences of the sentence.
3.4 Interesting issues/judges? comments
We asked the judges for feedback on the annotation pro-
cess and the di?culties faced. Here are some of the inter-
esting issues which cropped up :
 Some ideas/events cannot be covered by any single
sentence but only by a group of sentences. By them-
selves, none of the sentences might be relevant to the
event. For example, Suppose, the event is The Navy
and AOL contradict each other and we have two sen-
tences - \the navy has said in sworn testimony that

this did happen." and \america online is saying this
never happened." Clearly, any one sentence does not
adequately represent the event. This can be easily
taken care of by considering groups of sentences rather
than single sentences.
 Abstract ideas : Sometimes the meaning of individ-
ual sentences is totally dierent from overall idea they
convey. Satirical articles are an example of this. These
kind of ideas cannot be represented by sentence ex-
tracts. We omitted such events.
 Sometimes dierent stories totally contradict each
other. For example, some stories (on the same day)
claim a lead for Bush while others claim Gore to be far
ahead. This is more of a summarization issue though
and need not be dealt with while building the evalua-
tion corpus.
4. USING THE EVALUATION CORPUS
We have used the corpus for evaluating our system which
produces temporal summaries in news stream ([1]). The
problem of temporal summarization can be formalized as
follows. A news topic is made up of a set of events and
is discussed in a sequence of news stories. Most sentences
of the news stories discuss one or more of the events in the
topic. Some sentences are not germane to any of the events.
Those sentences are called \o-event" sentences and con-
trast with \on-event" sentences. The task of the system is
to assign a score to every sentence that indicates the impor-
tance of the sentence in the summary. This scoring yields
a ranking on all sentences in the topic, including o- and
on-event sentences.
We will use measures that are analogues of recall and
precision. We are interested in multiple properties:
 Useful sentences are those that have the potential to
be a meaningful part of the summary. O-event sen-
tences are not useful, but all other sentences are.
 Novel sentences are those that are not redundant|
i.e., are new in the presentation. The rst sentence
about an event is clearly novel, but all following sen-
tences discussing the same event are not.
Figure 3: nu-recall vs nu-precision plot for the task
of summarizing topic shifts in a news stream
 Size of the summary is a typical measure used in sum-
marization research and we include it here.
Based on those properties, we could dene the following
measure to capture the combination of usefulness and nov-
elty:
nu   recall =
P
I(r(e
i
) > 0)
E
nu  precision =
P
I(r(e
i
) > 0)
S
r
where S
r
is the number of sentences retrieved, E is the
number of events in the topic, e
i
is event number i (1  i 
E), r(e
i
) is the number of sentences retrieved for event e
i
,
I(exp) is 1 if exp is true and 0 if not. All summations are
as i ranges over the set of events. Note that S
r
6=
P
r(e
i
)
since completely o-topic sentences might be retrieved.
The nu-recall measure is the proportion of the events that
have been mentioned in the summary, and nu-precision is
the proportion of sentences retrieved that are the rst men-
tions of an event.
We used this measure to evaluate the performance of
our system over the entire training corpus. The results for
the training corpus are shown in the nu-recall/nu-precision
graph in gure 3. This work is described in detail else-
where([1]).
This is just one of the possible ways of using the corpus.
We can dene a number of other similar measures which
could be easily computed using the data provided by such a
corpus. These same measures can also be used to evaluate a
system producing single or multi-document summaries too.
5. FUTURE WORK
We intend to complete collecting user judgments for more
topics soon. After analyzing the reliablity of these judg-
ments and correcting the few mistakes that we had made
initially, we will collect annotations for more topics. Ini-
tially, we had used a simple barebones sentence parser, since
that is mostly su?cient for the work such a corpus would be
put to. Nevertheless, in future annotations, we will need to
improve the sentence parser. We intend to continue using
these judgments to evaluate the performance of the systems
that we are currently building to identify and summarize
topic shifts in news streams.

ABSTRACT
We describe a demonstration system built upon Topic Detection
and Tracking (TDT) technology. The demonstration system moni-
tors a stream of news stories, organizes them into clusters that rep-
resent topics, presents the clusters to a user, and visually describes
the changes that occur in those clusters over time. A user may also
mark certain clusters as interesting, so that they can be ?tracked?
more easily.
1. TDT BACKGROUND
The Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) research program in-
vestigates methods for organizing an arriving stream of news sto-
ries by the topics the stories discuss.[1, 4, 7, 8] Topics are de?ned
to be the set of stories that follow from some seminal event in the
world?this is in contrast to a broader subject-based notion of topic.
That is, stories about a particular airline crash fall into one topic,
and stories from other airline crashes will be in their own topics.
All organization is done as stories arrive, though variations of
the task allow ?nal organizational decisions to be postponed for
minutes, hours, or even days. The formal TDT evaluation program
includes the following research tasks:
1. Segmentation is used to separate a television or radio pro-
gram into distinct news stories. This process is not needed
for newswire services, since those stories arrive pre-segmented.
2. Detection is the task of putting all arriving news stories into
bins that represent broad news topics. If a new topic appears
in the news, the system must create a new bin. Neither the
set of bins nor the total number of them is known in advance.
This task is carried out without any supervision?i.e., the
system never knows whether or not the stories it is putting
together actually belong together.
3. Tracking is the task of ?nding all stories that follow are on
the same topic as an initial small set. This task is different
from detection in that the starting stories are known to be on
the same topic. Typically tracking is evaluated with 2-4 on-
topic stories.
.
The TDT research workshops also include a few other tasks (?rst
story detection, and story link detection). TDT has also inspired
other event-based organization methods, including automatic time-
line generation to visualize the temporal locality of topics[10], and
the identi?cation of new information within a topic?s discussion[3].
This demonstration system illustrates event-based news organi-
zation by visualizing the creation of, changes within, and relation-
ships between clusters created by the detection task. It leverages
the segmentation results so that audio stories are distinct stories,
but does not directly visualize the detection. Tracking is implicity
presented by allowing clusters to be marked so that they receive
special attention by the user.
2. ARCHITECTURE
The TDT demonstration system is based upon Lighthouse, an
interactive information retrieval system developed by Leuski.[6]
Lighthouse provides not only a typical ranked list search result, but
a visualization of inter-document similarities in 2- or 3-dimensions.
The user interface is a Java client that can run as an application or
an applet. Lighthouse uses http protocols to send queries to a server
and receive the ranked list, summary information about the docu-
ments, and the visualization data.
The TDTLighthouse system requires a TDT system running in
the background. In this version of the demonstration, the TDT sys-
tem is only running the segmentation and detection tasks described
above. Stories arrive and are put into clusters (bins).
The TDTLighthouse client can query its server to receive up-to-
date information about the clusters that the TDT system has found.
The server in turn queries the TDT system to get that information
and maintains state information so that changes (cluster growth,
additional clusters, etc.) can be highlighted.
3. DEMONSTRATION DATA
The data for this demonstration was taken from the our TDT
2000 evaluation output on the TDT cluster detection task [8]. The
sytem is running on the TDT-3 evaluation collection of news arti-
cles, approximately 40,000 news stories spanning October 1 through
December 31, 1998.
We simulated incremental arrival of the data as follows. At the
end of each day in the collection, we looked at the incremental
output of the TDT detection system. At this point, every story has
been classi?ed into a cluster. Every story seen to date is in one of
the clusters for that day, even if the cluster has the same contents as
it did yesterday.
The demonstration is designed to support text summarization
tools that could help a user understand the content of the cluster.
For our purposes, each cluster was analyzed to construct the fol-
lowing information:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Figure 1: TDT demonstration system running on TDT-3 data, approximately four weeks into the collection.
1. The title was generated by selecting the 10 most commonly
occurring non-stopwords throughout the cluster. A better ti-
tle would probably be the headline of the most ?representa-
tive? news story, though this is an open research question.
2. The summary was generated by selecting the ?ve sentences
that were most representative of the entire cluster. Better ap-
proaches might generate a summary from the multiple doc-
uments [9] or summarize the changes from the previous day
[5, 2].
3. The contents of the cluster is just a list of every story in the
cluster, presented in reverse chronological order. Various
alternative presentations are possible, including leveraging
the multimedia (radio and television) that is the basis for the
TDT data.
The demonstration system was setup so that it could move from
between the days. All of the input to the client was generated au-
tomatically, but we saved the information so that it could be shown
more quickly. It typically takes a few minutes to generate all of the
presentation information for a single day?s clusters.
4. DEMONSTRATION SYSTEM
Figure 1 shows the client window. This snapshot shows the sys-
tem on October 31 at 10:00pm, approximately four weeks into the
data. The status line on the lower-left shows that at this point the
system has already encountered almost 16,000 stories and has bro-
ken them into about 2400 topic clusters.
The system is showing the 50 topics with the largest number of
stories. The ranked list (by size) starts on the upper-left, shows the
?rst 25, and the continues in the upper-right. The ?title? for each
of those topics is generated in this case by the most common words
within the cluster. Any system that does a better job of building
a title for a large cluster of stories could be used to improve this
capability.
In addition to the ranked list of topics, the system computes inter-
topic similarities and depicts that using the spheres in the middle.
If two topics are highly similar, their spheres will appear near each
other in the visualization. This allows related topics to be detected
quickly. Because the 50 largest topics are shown, the topics are
more unalike than they would be with a wider range, but it is still
possible to see, for example, that topics about the Clinton pres-
idency are near each other (the cyan pair of spheres overlapping
rank number 9, topic rank numbers 5 and 29). The spheres and the
ranked list are tightly integrated, so selecting one causes the other
to be highlighted.
Topics can be assigned colors to make them easier to pick out in
future sessions. In this case, the user has chosen to use the same
color for a range of related topics?e.g., red for sports topics, green
for weather topics, etc. The color selection is in the control of
the user and is not done automatically. However, once a color is
assigned to a topic, the color is ?sticky? for future sessions. A user
might choose to color a critical topic bright red so that changes to
it stand out in the future.
Figure 2 shows the same visualization, but here a summary of
a selected topic is shown in a pop-up balloon. This summary was
generated by selecting sentences that contained large numbers of
key concepts from the topic. Any summarization of a cluster could
be used here if it provided more useful information.
To illustrate how the demonstration system shows changes in
TDT clusters over time, Figure 3 shows an updated visualization
for two weeks later (November 14, 1998). The topic colors are

persistent from Figure 1, though one of the marked topics (?Straw-
berry cancer colon Yankee?) is no longer in the largest 50 so does
not appear.
Most of the spheres include a small ?wedge? of yellow in them.
That indicates the proportion of the topic that is new stories (since
Figure 1). Some topics have large numbers of new stories, so have
a large yellow slice, whereas a few have a very small number of
new stories, so have only a thin wedge. The yellow wedge can be
as much as 50% of the sphere (which would represent an entirely
new topic), and only covers the top of the sphere. This restriction
ensures that the topic color is still visible.
The controls at the top of the screen are for moving between
queries, issuing a query, and returning the visualization to a ?home?
point. The next ?ve controls affect the layout of the display, includ-
ing allowing a 3-D display: a 3-D version of Figure 3 is shown in
Figure 4. The ?nal control enables a browsing wizard that can be
used to ?nd additional topics that are very similar to a selected topic
color (that set is chosen using the pull-down menu that has ?none?
in it).

5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
The demonstration system described above illustrates the effect
of TDT technology. It is also interesting in its own right, allow-
ing a user to track news topics of interest and to see how changes
occur over time. There is no reason that the same system could
not be used for non-TDT environments: any setting that clusters
documents might be appropriate for this system.
We are working to extend the demonstration system to include
some additional features.
? Considering the large number of topics (almost 3,000 in Fig-
ure 3), it is unlikely that all ?interesting? topics will be ?nd-
able. The query box at the top of the display will be used to
allow the user to ?nd topics that match a request. The ranked
list will display the top 50 topics that match the query.
? Related to querying, we hope to include an ?alert? feature
that will ?ag newly-created topics that match a query. For
example, an analyst interested in the Middle East might de-
velop a query that would identify topics in that region. When
such a topic appeared, it would be ?agged for the user (prob-
ably with a ?hot topic? color).
? We hope to allow user ?correction? of the topic breakdown
provided by the TDT system. The state-of-the-art in TDT
still makes mistakes, sometimes pulling two similar topics
together, and sometimes breaking a single topic into multiple
clusters. We intend that a user who sees such a mistake be
able to indicate it to the system. That information will, in
turn, to be relayed back to the TDT system to affect future
processing.
? We will be implementing an ?explode this topic? feature that
will show the stories within a topic analogously to the way
the current system shows the topics within the news. If the
topic is small enough, for example, the spheres would repre-
sent stories within the topic. If the topic is larger, the spheres
might represnt sub-clusters within the topic.
