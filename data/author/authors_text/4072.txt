Abstract 
We describe the way we adapted a text 
analysis tool for annotating with the Lin-
guistic Description Scheme of MPEG-7 
text related to and extracted from multi-
media content. Practically applied in the 
DIRECT-INFO EC R&D project we 
show how such linguistic annotation con-
tributes to semantic annotation of multi-
modal analysis systems, demonstrating 
also the use of the XML schema of 
MPEG-7 for supporting cross-media se-
mantic content annotation. 
1 Introduction 
In the R&D project DIRECT-INFO the concrete 
business case of sponsorship tracking was tar-
geted. The scenario investigated within the pro-
ject was that sponsors want to know how often 
their brands are mentioned in connection with 
the sponsored company. The visual detection of a 
brand (e.g. in videos) is not sufficient to meet the 
requirements of this business case. Multimodal 
analysis and fusion ? as implemented within DI-
RECT-INFO ? is needed in order to fulfill these 
requirements (Rehatschek, 2004).  
Within this context text analysis has been ap-
plied to documents reporting on entities, like 
football teams, that have close relations to large 
sponsoring companies. In the text analysis com-
ponent of the system we had to detect if an entity 
was mentioned positively, negatively or neu-
trally. Besides all the processing and annotation 
issues to positive or negative mentions, we had 
to make our results available to a global MPEG-7 
document, which is encoding the annotation re-
sults of various analysis of the modalities in-
volved (logo detection, speech recognition, text 
analysis etc.). This global MPEG-7 document 
was the input for a fusion component. 
In the next sections we describe the Text 
Analysis (TA) component of DIRECT-INFO. 
We then briefly describe the linguistic descrip-
tion scheme (LDS) of MPEG-7 and show the 
annotation generated by the TA. Finally we 
briefly discuss the role the LDS, and generally 
speaking MPEG-7, can play in supporting an 
interoperable cross-media annotation strategy. It 
seems to us, that LDS is offering a good mean 
for adding semantic metadata to image/video, but 
not for a real semantic integration of text and 
media content annotation, which in the case of 
DIRECT-INFO was performed by an additional 
fusion component. 
2 The detection of positive/negative 
mentioning 
Our work in DIRECT-INFO has been dedicated 
in enhancing an already existing tool for linguis-
tic annotation. This tool, called SCHUG (Shal-
low and CHunk-based Unification Grammar 
tool), is annotating texts considering both lin-
guistic constituency and dependency structures 
(T. Declerck, M. Vela 2005). 
A first development step was dedicated in cre-
ating specialized lexicons for various types of 
lexical categories (like nouns, adjectives and 
verbs) that can bear the property of being intrin-
sically positive or negative in a specific domain, 
as can be seen just below in the case of soccer: 
 
command => {POS => Noun, INT => "positive"} 
dominate => {POS => Verb, INT => "positive"} 
weak => {POS => Adj, INT => "negative"} 
 
Considering a sentence like ?ManU takes the 
command in the game against the weak Spanish 
53
team?, the head-noun of the direct object (lin-
guistically speaking) ?the command? gets from 
the access to the specialized DIRECT-INFO 
lexicon a tag ?INTERPRETATION? with value 
?positive?. Whereas the adjective ?weak? in the 
PP-adjunct ?in the game against the weak Span-
ish team? gets an ?INTERPRETATION? tag 
with value ?negative?.  
Once the words in the sentence have been 
lexically tagged with respect to their interpreta-
tion, the computing of the pos./neg. interpreta-
tion at the level of linguistic fragments and then 
at the level of the sentences can start. For this we 
have defined heuristics along the lines of the de-
pendency structures delivered by the linguistic 
analysis. So in the case of the NP ?the weak 
Spanish team?, the head noun ?team?, as such a 
neutral expression, is getting the ?INTERPRE-
TATION? tag with the value ?negative?, since it 
is modified by a ?negative? adjective. In case the 
reference resolution algorithm of the linguistic 
tools has been able to specify that the ?Spanish 
team? is in fact ?Real Madrid? this entity gets a 
negative ?INTERPRETATION? tag. 
The head noun of the NP realizing the subject 
of the sentence, ?ManU? gets a positive mention 
tag, since it is the subject of a positive verb and 
direct object combination (the NP ?the com-
mand? having a positive reading, whereas the 
verb ?takes? has a neutral reading). 
A last aspect to be mentioned here concerns 
the treatment of the so-called polarity items. 
Specific words in natural language intrinsically 
carry a negation or position force (or scope). So 
the words not, none or no have an intrinsic nega-
tion force and negate the words and fragments in 
the context in which those specific words are 
occurring. The context that is negated by such 
words can be also called the ?scope? (or the 
range) of the negation. Consider for example the 
sentence: ?I would definitely pay ?15 million to 
get Owen, not even a decent striker, instead?? 
Our tools are able to detect that the NP ?decent 
striker? is negated, and therefore the positive 
reading of ?decent striker? is being ruled out. 
3 Metadata Description 
The different content analysis modules of the 
DIRECT-INFO system extract different types of 
metadata, ranging from low-level audiovisual 
feature descriptions to semantic metadata. The 
global metadata description must be rich and has 
to clearly interrelate the various analysis results, 
as it is the input of the fusion component. 
4.1 Using MPEG-7 for Detailed Description of 
Audiovisual Content 
In DIRECT-INFO the MPEG-7 standard is used 
for metadata description. It is an excellent choice 
for describing audiovisual content because of its 
comprehensiveness and flexibility. The compre-
hensiveness results from the fact that the stan-
dard has been designed for a broad range of ap-
plications and thus employs very general and 
widely applicable concepts. The standard con-
tains a large set of tools for diverse types of an-
notations on different semantic levels. The flexi-
bility of MPEG-7, which is provided by a high 
level of generality, makes it usable for a broad 
application area without imposing strict con-
straints on the metadata models of these applica-
tions. The flexibility is very much based on the 
structuring tools and allows the description to be 
modular and on different levels of abstraction. 
MPEG-7 supports fine grained description, and it 
is possible to attach descriptors to arbitrary seg-
ments on any level of detail of the description.  
Among the descriptive tools developed within 
the MPEG-7 framework, one is concerned with 
the use of natural language for adding metadata 
to the content description of image and video: the 
so-called Linguistic Description Scheme (LDS). 
4.2 MPEG-7: The Linguistic Description 
Scheme (LDS) 
MPEG-7 foresees four kinds of textual annota-
tion that can be attached as metadata to some 
audio-video content. The natural language ex-
pression used here is ?Spain scores a goal against 
Sweden. The scoring player is Morientes?. 
Free Text Annotation: Here only tags are put 
around the text: 
<TextAnnotation> 
   <FreeTextAnnotation xml:lang="en"> 
   Spain scores a goal against Sweden. 
   The scoring player is Morientes. 
   </FreeTextAnnotation> 
</TextAnnotation> 
 
Key Word Annotation: Key Words are ex-
tracted from text and correspondingly annotated: 
<TextAnnotation> 
   <KeywordAnnotation> 
     <Keyword>score</Keyword> 
     <Keyword>Sweden</Keyword> 
     <Keyword>Spain</Keyword> 
     <Keyword>Morientes</Keyword> 
   </KeywordAnnotation> 
</TextAnnotation> 
 
 
 
54
Structured Annotation: Question/Answering 
like semantics is associated to the text: 
<TextAnnotation> 
  <StructuredAnnotation> 
    <Who><Name>Spain</Name></Who> 
    <WhatAction><Name>score      
goal</Name></WhatAction> 
    <Where><Name>A Coru?a, 
Spain</Name></Where> 
    <When><Name>March 25, 
1998<Name></When> 
  </StructuredAnnotation> 
</TextAnnotation> 
 
Dependency Structure: Here the full linguis-
tic apparatus is used for annotating the text: 
<TextAnnotation> 
 <DependencyStructure> 
  <Sentence> 
   <Phrase operator="subject"> 
    <Head type="noun">Spain</Head> 
   </Phrase> 
   <Head type="verb" base-
Form="score">scored</Head> 
   <Phrase operator="object"> 
    <Head type="article noun">a 
goal</Head> 
   </Phrase> 
   <Phrase> 
    <Head 
type="preposition">against</Head> 
   <Phrase> 
    <Head>Sweden</Head></Phrase> 
   </Phrase> 
  </Sentence> 
 </DependencyStructure> 
</TextAnnotation>1 
4 MPEG-7 Format of the Text Analysis 
component in DIRECT-INFO 
On the base of the linguistic analysis of our de-
pendency  parser, we generate the ?structured 
annotation? of the MPEG-7 Linguistic Descrip-
tion Scheme. We think that this kind of annota-
tion is the most practical of LDS for adding se-
mantics to multimedia content, since it is proba-
bly more intuitive for the media expert as the 
underlying linguistic dependency structure. At 
the same  time it seems also straightforward to 
go first for a (internal) dependency analysis, 
since it is then relatively easy to map automati-
cally dependency units to the ?Who?, ?WhatAc-
tion? and other tags of LDS. 
The MPEG-7 output of the TA module of DI-
RECT-INFO looks like:

Without going into too much detail here, it is 
enough to stress that in the first part of the anno-
tation, the link to the general multimedia and 
multimodal repository is ensured. We have to 
55
deal with a PDF document that should be proc-
essed by a Text Analysis tool. The ?essence? ID 
is giving information about the location where 
the application relevant data is stored and where 
the results of the Text Analysis should be stored. 
All this metadata is ensuring the combination of 
the results of the analysis of various modalities 
dealing with one application relevant dataset (for 
example the combination of the logo detection of 
a brand and the related positive or negative men-
tioning of a team sponsored by this brand).  For 
reason of place, we can not show and comment 
here the complete (and multimodal) MPEG-7 
annotation, but details are given in (G. Kienast, 
2005). 
The second part of the annotation gives the re-
sults of the combined linguistic and ?structured? 
analysis we are dealing with. As mentioned 
above, in the case of DIRECT-INFO, results of 
text analysis are accessed via the structured an-
notation of the Linguistic Description Schema of 
MPEG-7. 
5 Conclusions and future Work 
In the DIRECT-INFO project we managed to 
include results of text analysis in an automated 
fashion into a MPEG-7 description, which was 
dealing with the XML representation of the 
analysis of various modalities. Using correspond-
ing metadata, it was possible to ensure the en-
coding/annotation of the related results in one 
file and to facilitate the access to the separated 
annotation using XPath. As such the DIRECT-
INFO MPEG-7 annotation schema is offering a 
practicable multi-dimensional annotation 
scheme, if we consider a ?dimensions? as being 
the output of the analysis of various modalities. 
MPEG-7 proved to be generic and flexible 
enough for combining, saving and accessing 
various types of annotation.  
Limitations of MPEG-7 were encountered 
when the task was about fusion or merging of 
information encoded in the various descriptors 
(or features), and this task was addressed in a 
posterior step, whereas the encoding scheme of 
MPEG-7 was not longer helpful, in defining for 
example relations between the annotation result-
ing from the different modules or for defining 
constraints between those annotation. There 
seems to be a need for a higher level of represen-
tation for annotation resulting from the analysis 
of distinct media, being low-level features for 
images or high-level semantic features for texts.  
The need of  an ?ontologization? of multime-
dia features has been already recognized and pro-
jects are already dealing with this, like AceMe-
dia. Initial work in relating multimodal annota-
tion in DIRECT-INFO will be further developed 
in K-Space, a new Network of Excellence, which 
goal is to provide for support in semantic infer-
ence for both automatic and semi-automatic an-
notation and retrieval of multimedia content. K-
Space aims at closing the ?semantic gap? be-
tween the low-level content descriptions and the 
richness and subjectivity of semantics in high-
level human interpretations of audiovisual media.
