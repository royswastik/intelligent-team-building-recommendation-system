We present in this paper the method of 
English-to-Korean(E-K) transliteration and 
back-transliteration. In Korean technical 
documents, many English words are translit- 
erated into Korean words in w~rious tbrms in 
diverse ways. As English words and Korean 
transliterations are usually technical terms and 
proper nouns, it; is hard to find a transliteration 
and its variations in a dictionary. Theretbre 
an automatic transliteration system is needed 
to find the transliterations of English words 
without manual intervention. 
3?.o explain E-K transliteration t)henomena, 
we use phoneme chunks that do not have a 
length limit. By aI)plying phoneme chunks, 
we combine different length intbrmation with 
easy. The E-K transliteration method h~m 
three stet)s. In the first, we make a t)honeme 
network that shows all possible transliterations 
of the given word. In the second step, we apply 
t)honeme chunks, extracted fl'om training data, 
to calculate the reliability of each possible 
transliteration. Then we obtain probable 
transliterations of the given English word. 
1 Introduct ion 
In Korean technical documents, many English 
words are used in their original forms. But 
sometimes they are transliterated into Korean 
in different forms. Ex. 1, 2 show the examples 
of w~rious transliterations in KTSET 2.0(Park 
et al, 1996).

(c) ~1 z\] ~ (ticithel) \[6\] 
These various transliterations are not negligi- 
ble tbr natural angnage processing, especially ill 
information retrieval. Because same words are 
treated as different ones, the calculation based 
(m tile frequency of word would produce mis- 
leading results. An experiment shows that the 
effectiveness of infbrmation retrieval increases 
when various tbrms including English words are 
treated eqnivMently(Jeong et al, 1997). 
We may use a dictionary, to tind a correct 
transliteratkm and its variations. But it is not 
fhasible because transliterated words are usually 
technical terms and proper nouns that have rich 
productivity. Therefore an automatic translit- 
eration system is needed to find transliterations 
without manual intervention. 
There have been some studies on E-K 
transliteration. They tried to explain translit- 
eration as tflloneme-lmr-phoneme or alphabet- 
per-phonenm classification problem. They re- 
stricted the information length to two or three 
units beibre and behind an input unit. In tact, 
ninny linguistic phenomena involved in the E-K 
transliteration are expressed in terms of units 
that exceed a phoneme and an alphabet. For 
example, 'a' in 'ace' is transliterated into %11 
?l (ey0" lint in 'acetic', "ot (eft and ill 'acetone', 
"O}(a)". If we restrict the information length 
to two alphabets, then we cmmot explain these 
phenomena. Three words ge~ the same result 
~()r ~ a'.  
(3) ace otl o\] ~(eyisu) 
(4) acetic cq.q v I (esithik) 
418 
(5) acetone ol-J~ll ~-(aseython) 
In this t)at)er, we t)rot)ose /;he E-K transliter- 
al;ion model t)ased on l)honeme chunks that 
do not have a length limit and can explain 
transliter;~tion l)henolnem, in SOllle degree of 
reliability. Not a alphal)et-per-all)habet but a 
chunk-i)er-chunk classification 1)roblem. 
This paper is organized as tbllows. In section 
2, we survey an E-K transliteration. \]111 section 
3, we propose, phonenm chunks 1)asexl translit- 
eration and back-transliteration. In Seel;ion 4, 
the lesults of ext)erilnents are presented. Fi- 
nally, the con(:hlsion follows in section 5. 
2 Eng l i sh - to -Korean  t rans l i te ra t ion  
E-K transliteration models are (:lassitied in two 
methods: the l)ivot method and the direct 
method. In the pivot method, transliteration 
is done in two steps: (:onverting English words 
ill|;() pronunciation symbols and then (:onverting 
these symbols into Kore~m wor(ts by using the 
Korean stm~(tard conversion rule. In the direct 
method, English words are directly converted to 
Korean words without interlnediate stct)s. An 
exl)eriment shows that the direct method is bet- 
ter than the pivot method in tin(ling wtriations 
of a transliteration(Lee and (~hoi, 1998). Statis- 
ti(:al information, neural network and de(:ision 
tree were used to imt)lelneld; the direct method. 
2.1 S ta t i s t iea l  T rans l i te ra t ion  method 
An English word is divided into phoneme se- 
quence or alphal)et sequence as (21~(22~... ~e n. 
Then a corresponding Korean word is rel)- 
resented as kl, k2,. . .  , t~:n. If n correspond- 
ing Korean character (hi) does not exist, we 
fill the blank with '-'. For example, an En- 
glish word "dressing" and a Korean word "> 
N\] zg (tuleysing)" are represented as Fig. 1. The 
ut)per one in Fig. 1 is divided into an English 
phoneme refit and the lower one is divided into 
an alphabet mlit.

Figure 1: An E-K transliteration exault)le 
The t)roblem in statistical transliteration 
reel;hod is to lind out the. lllOSt probable translit- 
eration fbr a given word. Let p(K) be the 1)tel)- 
ability of a Korean word K, then, for a given 
English word E, the transliteration probal)ility 
of a word K Call be written as P(KIE). By using 
the Bayes' theorem, we can rewrite the translit- 
eration i)rol)lem as follows: 
,a'.q maz p(K IE )  = a,..q ma:,: p(K)p(~IK)  (1) 
K K 
With the Markov Independent Assulni)tion , 
we apl)roximate p(K) and p(EIK) as tbllows: 
7~ 
i=2 
i=1 
As we do not know the t)rommciation of a 
given word, we consider all possible tfllonelne 
sequences, l?or exanlple, 'data' has tbllowing 
possible t)holmme sequences, 'd-a-t-a, d-at-a, 
da-ta, . . . ' .  
As the history length is lengthened, we. can 
get more discrimination. But long history in- 
fornlation c~mses a data sl)arseness prol)lenl. In 
order to solve, a Sl)arseness t)rol)len~, Ma.ximmn 
Entropy Model, Back-off, and Linear intert)ola- 
tion methods are used. They combine different 
st~tistical estimators. (Tae-il Kim, 2000) use u t) 
to five phonemes in feature finlction(Berger et 
a,l., 1996). Nine %ature flmctions are combined 
with Maximum Entrot)y Method. 
2.2 Neura l  Network  and  Dec is ion  Tree 
Methods based 011 neural network and decision 
tree detenninistically decide a Korean charac- 
ter for a given English input. These methods 
take two or three alphabets or t)honemes as 
an input and generate a Korean alphabet 
or phoneme as an output. (Jung-.\]ae Kim, 
1.999) proposed a neural network method that 
uses two surrom~ding t)holmmes as an intmt. 
(Kang, 1999) t)roposed a decision tree method 
that uses six surrounding alphabets. If all 
inl)ut does not cover the phenomena of prol)er 
transliterations, we cammt gel; a correct answer. 
419 
Even though we use combining methods to 
solve the data sparseness problem, the increase 
of an intbrmation length would double the 
complexity and the time cost of a problem. It 
is not easy to increase the intbrmation length. 
To avoid these difficulties, previous studies 
does not use previous outputs(ki_z). But it 
loses good information of target language. 
Our proposed method is based on the direct 
method to extract the transliteration and its 
variations. Unlike other methods that deter- 
mine a certain input unit's output with history 
information, we increase the reliability of a cer- 
tain transliteration, with known E-K transliter- 
ation t)henonmna (phoneme chunks). 
3 Trans l i te ra t ion  us ing  Mul t ip le  
unbounded over lapp ing  phoneme 
chunks  
For unknown data, we can estimate a Korean 
transliteration ti'onl hand-written rules. We 
can also predict a Korean transliteration with 
experimental intbrmation. With known English 
and Korean transliteration pairs, we can as- 
sume possible transliterations without linguistic 
knowledge. For example, 'scalar" has common 
part with 'scalc:~sqlN (suhhcyil)', ' casinoJ\[ 
xl  (t:hacino)', 't:oala:   e-l-&:hoalla)', and 
'car:~l-(kh.a)' (Fig. 2). We can assume possible 
transliteration with these words and their 
transliterations. From 'scale' and its transliter- 
ation l'-~\] ~ (sukheyil), the 'sc' in 'scalar' can be 
transliterated as '~:-J(sukh)'. From a 'casino' 
example, the 'c' has nlore evidence that can be 
transliterated as 'v  (kh)'. We assume that we 
can get a correct Korean transliteration, if we 
get useful experinlental information and their 
proper weight that represents reliability. 
3.1 The a l ignment  of  an Engl ish word  
with  a Korean  word 
We can align an English word with its translit- 
eration in alphabet unit or in phoneme unit. 
Korean vowels are usually aligned with English 
vowels and Korean consonants are aligned with 
English consonants. For example, a Korean 
consonant, '1~ (p)' can be aligned with English 
consonants 'b', 'p', and 'v'. With this heuristic 
we can align an English word with its translit- 
eration in an alphabet unit and a t)honeIne unit 
with the accuracy of 99.4%(Kang, 1999).

3.2 Ext ract ion  o f  Phoneme Chunks  
From aligned training data, we extract phoneme 
clumks. We emmw.rate all possible subsets of 
the given English-Korean aligned pair. During 
enumerating subsets, we add start and end posi- 
tion infbrmation. From an aligned data "dress- 
ing" and "~etl N (tuleysing)", we can get subsets 
as Table 12.

The context stands tbr a given English al- 
phabets, and the output stands for its translit- 
eration. We assign a proper weight to each 
phoneme chunk with Equation 4. 
C ( output ) 
wei.qh, t(contcxt : output) - C(contcxt) (4) 
C(x) means tile frequency of z in training data. 
Equation 4 shows that the ambiguous phe- 
nomenon gets the less evidence. The clnmk 
weight is transmitted to each phoneme symbol. 
To compensate for the length of phoneme, we 
multiply the length of phoneme to the weight of 
the phoneme chunk(Fig. 3).

\]?igure 3: The weight of a clmnk and a t)honeme 
This chunk weight does not mean the. relia- 
t)ility of a given transliteration i)henomenon. 
We know real reliM)itity, after all overlapping 
phonenm chunks are applied. The chunk that 
has some common part with other chunks 
gives a context information to them. Therefore 
a chunk is not only an int)ut unit but also 
a means to (-Mculate the reliability of other 
dmnks. 
We also e, xl;ra(:t the  connection information. 
From Migned training (b:~ta, we obtain M1 pos- 
sible combinations of Korem~ characters and 
English chara(:ters. With this commction in- 
tbrmation, we exclude iml)ossit)h; connections 
of Korean characters ~md English phon(;nte se- 
quences. We can gel; t;he following (:ommction

3.3 A Trans l i te ra t ion  Network  
For a given word, we get al t)ossil)h~ t)honemes 
and make a Korean transliteration etwork. 
Each node in a net;work has an English t)honent(; 
and a ('orrcspondillg Korean character. Nodes 
are comm(:ted with sequence order. For exam- 
ple, 'scalar' has the Kore, an transliteration et- 
work as Fig. 4. In this network, we dis('ommct 
some no(les with extracted (:onne('tion infornla- 
tion. 
After drawing the Korean tr~msliteration net- 
work, we apply all possible phone, me, chunks 
to the. network. Each node increases its own 
weight with the weight of t)honeme symbol in a 
phoneme chunks (Fig. 5). By overlapping the 
weight, nodes in the longer clmnks get; more ev- 
idence. Then we get the best t)ath that has the 
Figure 4: Korean Transliteration Network for 
'scalar' 
highest sum of weights, with the Viterbi algo- 
ril, hm. The Tree.-Trcllis Mgorithm is used to gel; 
the variations(Soong and Huang, 1991).

E-K back transliteration is a more difficult prot)- 
lem thtnt F,-K trmlsliteration. During the E-K

spectively and the long sound and the short 
strand are also treated equivalently. Therefim', 
the number of possible English phone, rues per 
a Korean character is bigger than the number 
of Korean characters per an English phoneme. 
The ambiguity is increased. In  E-K back- 
transliteration, Korean 1)honemes and English 
phoneme, s switch their roles. Just switching the

English word in a phoneme unit or a character

5 Exper iments  
Experiments were done in two points of view: 
the accuracy test and the variation coverage 
test. 
5.1 Test Sets 
We use two data sets for an accuracy test. Test 
Set I is consists of 1.,650 English and Korean 
word pairs that aligned in a phoneme unit. It 
was made by (Lee and Choi, 1998) and tested by 
many methods. To compare our method with 
other methods, we use this data set. We use 
same training data (1,500 words) and test data 
(150 words). Test Set I I  is consists of 7,185 
English and Korean word paii's. We use Test 
Set H to show the relation between the size of 
training data and the accuracy. We use 90% 
of total size as training data and 10% as test 
data. For a variation coverage test, we use Test 
Set I I I  that is extracted from KTSET 2.0. Test 
Set HI  is consists of 2,391 English words and 
their transliterations. An English word has 1.14 
various transliterations in average. 
5.2 Eva luat ion funct ions 
Accuracy was measured by the percentage of 
the number of correct transliterations divided 
by the number of generated transliterations. We 
(:all it as word accuracy(W.A.). We use one 
more measure, called character accuracy(C.A.) 
that measures the character edit distance be- 
tween a correct word and a generated word. 
no.  of  correct words 
W.A. = no. o.f .qenerated words (5) 
C.A. = L (6) 
where L is the length of the original string, and 
i, d, mid s are the number of insertion, deletion 
and substitution respectively. If the dividend is 
negative (when L < (i + d + s)), we consider it 
as zero(Hall and Dowling, 1980). 
For the real usage test, we used variation cov- 
erage (V.C.) that considers various usages. We 
evaluated both tbr the term frequency (tf) and 
document frequency (d J), where tfis the number 
of term appearance in the documents and df is 
the number of documents that contain the term. 
If we set the usage tf (or d./) of the translitera- 
tions to 1 tbr each transliteration, we can calcu- 
late the transliteration coverage tbr the unique 
word types, single .frequency(.sf). 
V.C. = {if ,  df, s f}  of  found  words (7) {t.f, 4f, <f} of  ,sed   o,'ds

With the same length of information, we 
get the higher C.A. and W.A. than other 
methods. It means previous outputs give good 
information and our chunk-based nmthod is 
a good combining method. It also suggests 
that we can restrict he max size of chunk in a 
permissible size. 
PCa gets a higher accuracy than PCp. It 
is clue to the number of possible phoneme se- 
quences. A transliteration network that con- 
sists of phoneme nnit has more nodes than a 
transliteration network that consists of alpha- 
bet unit. With small training data, despite of 
the loss due to the phoneme sequences ambi- 
guity a phoneme gives more intbrmation than 
an alphabet. When the infbrmation is enough, 
PCa outpertbrms Pep. 
6 Conc lus ions  
We propose the method of English-to-Korean 
transliteration and back-transliteration with 
multiple mfl)ounded overlapping phoneme 
chunks. We showed that E-K transliteration 
and back-transliteration are not a t)honeme- 
per-phoneme and alphabet-per-alphabet 
classification problem. So we use phoneme 
chunks that do not have a length limit and 
can explain E-K transliteration phenomena. 
We get the reliability of a given transliter- 
ation phenomenon by applying overlapt)ing 
phoneme chunks. Our method is simple and 
does not need a complex combining method 
tbr w, rious length of information. The change 
of an intbrmation length does not affect the 
internal representation f the problem. Our 
chunk-based method can be used to other 
classification problems and can give a simple 
combining method.

Abstract
A word has many senses, and each sense can
be mapped into many target words. Therefore,
to select the appropriate translation with a cor-
rect sense, the sense of a source word should be
disambiguated before selecting a target word.
Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid
method for translation selection that combines
disambiguation of a source word sense and se-
lection of a target word. Knowledge for transla-
tion selection is extracted from a bilingual dic-
tionary and target language corpora. Dividing
translation selection into the two sub-problems,
we can make knowledge acquisition straightfor-
ward and select more appropriate target words.
1 Introduction
In machine translation, translation selection is
a process that selects an appropriate target lan-
guage word corresponding to a word in a source
language. Like other problems in natural lan-
guage processing, knowledge acquisition is cru-
cial for translation selection. Therefore, many
researchers have endeavored to extract knowl-
edge from existing resources.
As masses of language resources become avail-
able, statistical methods have been attempted
for translation selection and shown practical re-
sults. Some of the approaches have used a bilin-
gual corpus as a knowledge source based on the
idea of Brown et al (1990), but they are not
preferred in general since a bilingual corpus is
hard to come by. Though some latest approach-
es have exploited word co-occurrence that is ex-
tracted from a monolingual corpus in a target
language (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Prescher et al,
2000; Koehn and Knight, 2001), those methods
often fail in selecting appropriate words because
they do not consider sense ambiguity of a target
word.
In a bilingual dictionary, senses of a word are
classied into several sense divisions and also its
translations are grouped by each sense division.
Therefore, when one looks up the translation
of a word in a dictionary, she/he ought to re-
solve the sense of a word in a source language
sentence, and then choose a target word among
translations corresponding to the sense. In this
paper, the fact that a word has many senses
and each sense can be mapped into many tar-
get words (Lee et al, 1999) is referred to as the
`word-to-sense and sense-to-word' relationship,
based on which we propose a hybrid method for
translation selection.
In our method, translation selection is taken
as the combined problem of sense disambigua-
tion of a source language word and selection of
a target language word. To disambiguate the
sense of a source word, we employ both a dic-
tionary based method and a target word co-
occurrence based method. In order to select a
target word, the co-occurrence based method is
also used.
We introduce three measures for translation
selection: sense preference, sense probability
and word probability. In a bilingual dictionary,
example sentences are listed for each sense di-
vision of a source word. The similarity between
those examples and an input sentence can serve
as a measure for sense disambiguation, which we
dene as sense preference. In the bilingual dic-
tionary, target words are also recorded for each
sense division. Since the set of those words can
model each sense, we can calculate the probabil-
ity of the sense by applying the co-occurrence
based method to the set of words. We dene
the estimated probability as sense probability,
which is taken for the other measure of sense
disambiguation. Using co-occurrence, the prob-
ability of selecting a word from the set of trans-
lations can be calculated. We dene it as word
probability, which is a measure for word selec-
tion. Merging sense preference, sense probabili-
ty and word probability, we compute preference
for each translation, and then choose a target
word with the highest translation preference as
a translation.
2 Translation Selection based on
`word-to-sense and sense-to-word'
The `word-to-sense and sense-to-word' relation-
ship means that a word in a source language
could have multiple senses, each of which might
be mapped into various words in a target lan-
guage. As shown in examples below, a Korean
verb `meok-da' has many senses (work, deaf, eat,
etc.). Also `kkae-da' has three senses (break,
hatch, wake), among which the break sense of
`kkae-da' is mapped into multiple words such
as `break', `smash' and `crack'. In that case, if

? (X) saw a lunch
? (?) eat a lunch
? (O) have a lunch
? (O) take a lunch
`hatch' is selected as a translation of `kkae-da' in
a sentence `jeobsi-reul kkae-da', the translation
must be wrong because the sense of `kkae-da'
in the sentence is break rather than hatch. In
contrast, any word of the break sense of `kkae-
da' forms a well-translated sentence. Howev-
er, selecting a correct sense does not always
guarantee a correct translation. If the sense of
`meok-da' in `jeomsim-eul meok-da' is correctly
disambiguated as eat but an inappropriate tar-
get word is selected, an improper or unnatural
translation will be produced like `eat a lunch'.
Therefore, in order to get a correct transla-
tion, such a target word must be selected that
has the right sense of a source word and form-
s a proper target language sentence. Previous
approaches on translation selection usually try
to translate a source word directly into a target
word without considering the sense. Thus, they
increase the complexity of the problem and suf-

In this paper, we propose a method for
translation selection that reects `word-to-sense
and sense-to-word' relationship. We divide the
problem of translation selection into sense dis-
ambiguation of a source word and selection of
a target word. Figure 1 shows our process of
selecting translation. We introduce three mea-
sures for translation selection: sense preference
(spf) and sense probability (sp) for sense disam-
biguation, and word probability (wp) for word
selection.

. As shown
in the gure, example sentences and denition
sentences are listed for each sense of a source
word. In the gure, example sentences of the
destroy sense of `break' consist of words such as
`cup', `piece', and `thread', and those for the vio-
late sense consist of words such as `promise' and
`contract', which can function as indicators for
the sense of `break'. We calculate sense pref-
erence of a word for each sense by estimating
similarity between words in an input sentence
and words in example and denition sentences.
Each sense of a source word can be mapped
into a set of translations. As shown in the ex-
ample, the break sense of `kkae-da' is mapped
into the set f`break', `smash', `crack'g and some
words in the set can replace each other in a
translated sentence like `break/smash/crack a
