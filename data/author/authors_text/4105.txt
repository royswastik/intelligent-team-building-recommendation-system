Abstract 
In this work, we propose a new method 
for extracting user preferences from a few 
documents that might interest users. For 
this end, we first extract candidate terms 
and choose a number of terms called ini-
tial representative keywords (IRKs) from 
them through fuzzy inference. Then, by 
expanding IRKs and reweighting them us-
ing term co-occurrence similarity, the fi-
nal representative keywords are extracted. 
Performance of our approach is heavily 
influenced by effectiveness of selection 
method for IRKs so we choose fuzzy in-
ference because it is more effective in 
handling the uncertainty inherent in se-
lecting representative keywords of docu-
ments. The problem addressed in this 
paper can be viewed as the one of finding 
a representative vector of documents in 
the linear text classification literature. So, 
to show the usefulness of our approach, 
we compare it with two famous methods - 
Rocchio and Widrow-Hoff - on the 
Reuters-21578 collection. The results 
show that our approach outperforms the 
other approaches. 
1 Introduction 
Agent technology is able to provide increasingly 
more services for individuals, groups, and organi-
zations. Agents, which have been developed for 
Internet, have addressed many tasks such as infor-
mation finding, filtering and presentation, contract 
negotiation, and electronic commerce (Soltysiak 
and Crabtree, 2000). Most of them rely on the 
knowledge of the user. The inclusion of user in-
formation becomes a key area.  
A user model that represents some aspects of a 
user?s information needs or preferences can be use-
ful in any information system design, and in the 
case of information filtering (Kim et al, 2000). 
User models can be constructed by hand, or 
learned automatically based on feedback provided 
by the users. Some systems require users to explic-
itly specify their profiles, often as a set of key-
words or categories. But it is difficult for a user to 
exactly and correctly specify their information 
needs. The machine learning techniques offer the 
potential to automatic construction and continuous 
refinement of user model.  
The research systems adopting the machine 
learning techniques have been applied feedback 
techniques that explicitly provide relevance judg-
ments on documents. Studies have shown that such 
explicit feedback from the user is clearly useful 
(Goldberg, 1992; Yan and Garcia-Molina, 1995), 
but, in practice, many users are unwilling to pro-
vide relevance judgments on documents (Pazzani, 
M., Billsus, 1997; Baeza-Yates and  Ribeiro-Neto, 
1999) . Users may have problems to decide about 
some documents.  An alternative is to use implicit 
feedback where document relevance is inferred 
from user?s behavior, which has received increased 
attention in recent years (Nichols, 1997; Konstan et 
al., 1997; Kim, 2000)   
This paper focuses upon the extraction of user 
preferences from a few documents that might in-
terest a user. It does not consider how to provide 
relevance judgment on documents, i.e. it assumes 
This work was supported by grant No. 2000-1-51200-008-2
 from the Korea Science & Engineering Foundation 
that relevant documents are given explicitly or im-
plicitly. Our approach is based on the vector space 
model (Baeza-Yates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999), 
where text-based documents are represented as 
vectors of term weights. So, the problem addressed 
in this paper is how to extract representative key-
words from documents provided by a user and 
what weights should be assigned to these keywords. 
We present a new technique to solve this problem. 
The proposed method is composed of two parts, 
one is to select initial representative keywords 
(IRKs) and the other is to automatically expand 
and reweight IRKs. For the first part, we can con-
sider feature selection methods (Yang and Peder-
sen, 1997) that focus on performance improvement 
and dimensionality reduction of document classifi-
ers for a huge amount of documents covering vari-
ous categories. However, since this kind of 
methods select features using information of other 
categories and negative document sets as well as 
positive ones, it is impossible to apply these to the 
target problem in this paper that extract feature 
keywords from only few positive documents in the 
same category. As alternatives, we can consider 
the Rocchio algorithm and Widrow-Hoff algorithm 
used as a training algorithm for linear text classi-
fier since these algorithms can extract keywords 
and assign weights to them effectively with only 
positive document sets. However, here, a new 
technique that adopts fuzzy inference to extract or 
generate IRKs from a few example documents (the 
set of documents judged relevant by the users) is 
suggested since the existing algorithms did not 
show good results as we expected.  
For the second part, we can choose one of 
query term expansion and term weight modifica-
tion methods based on vector model (Xu and Croft , 
1996; Mitra et al,1998; Baeza-Yates and  Ribeiro-
Neto, 1999). Instead, we take a new approach 
where the term co-occurrence similarity is intro-
duced as a measure of similarity between the dis-
tributions within the feedbacked documents of a 
given term and the initial query. With this similar-
ity and the document frequency in feedbacked 
documents, the weight of the term in the new query 
was calculated.  
In the next section, Rocchio and Widrow-Hoff 
algorithms are reviewed. Section 3 presents a 
method for user?s preference extraction. The ex-
periments to test the proposed method will be out-
lined in Section 4. Finally, conclusion is followed. 
2 Background 
To extract a user?s preference from example docu-
ments is the same problem as finding their 
representative vector in linear text classifiers. A 
variety of algorithms for training linear classifiers 
have been suggested. Among them, here, we only 
review two widely used algorithms, Rocchio algo-
rithm and Widrow-Hoff algorithm, for comparing 
with our method.  
The Rocchio algorithm (David et al, 1996) is a 
batch algorithm. So, it produces a new weight vec-
tor w  from an existing weight vector oldw  by ana-
lyzing the entire set of training data at once. The 
j th?  component of w   is : 
c
Ci

x
n

ww ?
?

?
+= ??
,,
, ???               (1) 
where, ,i jx  means j th?  component of i th?  docu-
ment vector ix  and  n  is the number of training 
documents. C is the set of positive training docu-
ments, and cn is the number of positive training 
documents. The parameter ?? , and ?  control the 
relative impact of the original weight vector, the 
positive examples, and the negative examples, re-
spectively. However, in our experiments, ? = 0, 
? =1, and ?  = 0 because only positive examples 
are given in our application. Neither original 
weight vector nor negative examples is given.  
The Widrow-Hoff algorithm (David et al, 1996) 
is an online algorithm where one training example 
is presented at a time. It updates its current weight 
vector based on the example and then discards the 
example, retaining only the new weight vector. A 
new weight vector wi+1 is computed from an old 
weight vector iw  and a training document ix  with 
class label iy . The class label iy  is 1 if a training 
document ix  is in the set of positive or relevant 
training documents, otherwise 0. In our application, 
iy  is always 1 because we deal with only positive 
examples. The initial weight vector w1 is typically 
set to zero vector, w1 = (0, ... 0). 
1, , ,2 ( )i j i j i i i i jw w w x y x?+ = ? ? ?               (2) 
where,  ?   is the learning rate which controls how 
quickly the weight vector w is allowed to change 
and ii xw ? is the cosine value of the two vectors. 
3 Extraction of user preferences 
User preferences are extracted from a few example 
documents through two steps: a) the first step gen-
erates a set of keywords called IRKs (Initial Repre-
sentative Keywords) which corresponds to the 
initial user query in the relevance feedback tech-
niques of IR and b) these IRKs are expanded and 
reweighted by a relevance feedback technique. 
It is very important to select IRKs reflecting 
user?s preferences well from example or training 
documents (set of documents judged relevant by 
the user) because we have to calculate term co-
occurrences similarity between these IRKs and 
candidate terms within each example document. 
Three factors of a term (term frequency, document 
frequency within positive examples, and IDF) are 
used to calculate the importance of a specific term.  
Since these factors essentially have inexact and 
uncertain characteristics, we combine them by 
fuzzy inference instead of a simple equation.  
The IRKs are selected based on the selection 
criteria that each example document has at least 
one or more IRKs. After selecting the IRKs, we 
perform term modification process based on the 
term co-occurrence similarity between these IRKs 
and candidate terms. The Rocchio and Widrow-
Hoff algorithms do not consider the term co-
occurrence relationship within training documents. 
But, we regard the term co-occurrence relationship 
as the key factor to calculate the importance of 
terms under the assumption that the IRKs reflect 
user?s preferences well.  
3.1 Calculation of the Representativeness of 
Terms through Fuzzy Inference 
The given positive examples are transformed into 
the set of candidate terms through eliminating 
stopwords and stemming by Porter?s algorithm. 
The TF, DF, and IDF of each term are calculated 
based on this set and used as inputs of fuzzy infer-
ence. From now on, we will explain these three 
input variables. The TF (Term Frequency) is the 
term frequency of a specific term not in a docu-
ment but in a set of documents, which is calculated 
by dividing total occurrences of the term in a set of 
documents by the number of documents in the set 
containing the term. It needs to be normalized for 
being used in fuzzy inference. The following 
shows the normalized term frequency (NTF).

where, iTF  is the frequency of term ti in the exam-
ple documents, iDF  is the number of documents 
having term ti in the example document, 
[ ]j jMax x means the maximum value of vari-
able jx . 
The DF (Document Frequency) represents the 
frequency of documents having a specific term 
within the example documents. The normalized 
document frequency, NDF, is defined in equation 
(4), where iDF is the number of documents having 
term ti in the example documents.

The IDF (Inverse Document Frequency) repre-
sents the inverse document frequency of a specific 
term over an entire document collection not exam-
ple documents. The normalized inverse document 
frequency, NIDF, is defined as follows:

Figure 1 shows the membership functions of the 
input/output variables - 3 inputs (NTF, NDF, NIDF) 
and 1 output (TW) - used in our method. As you 
can see in Figure 1(a), NTF variable has 
{ S(Small), L(Large) }, and NDF and NIDF vari-
ables have { S(Small), M(Middle), L(Large) } as 
linguistic labels (or terms). The fuzzy output vari-
able, TW (Term Weight) which represents the im-
portance of a term, has six linguistic labels as 
shown in Figure 1(b). 
The 18 fuzzy rules are involved to infer the 
term weight (TW). The rules are constructed based 
on the intuition that the important or representative 
terms may occur across many positive example 
documents but not in general documents, i.e., their 
NDF and NIDF are very high. As shown in Table 1, 
the TW of a term is Z in most cases regardless of 
its NDF and NTF if its NIDF is S, because such 
term may occur frequently in any document and 
thus its NDF and NTF can be high. When NDF of 
a term is high and its NIDF is also high, the term is 
considered as a representative keyword and then 
the output value is between X and XX. The other 
rules were set similarly.

We can get the term weight TW through the 
following procedure. But, the output is in the form 
of fuzzy set and thus has to be converted to the 
crisp value. In this paper, the center of gravity 
method is used to defuzzify the output  (Lee, 1990). 
? Apply the NTF, NDF, and NIDF fuzzy val-
ues to the antecedent portions of 18 fuzzy 
rules. 
? Find the minimum value among the mem-
bership degrees of three input fuzzy values. 
? Classify every 18 membership degree into 6 
groups according to the fuzzy output vari-
able TW. 
? Calculate the maximum output value for 
each group and then generate 6 output val-
ues. 
3.2 Selection of Initial Representative Key-
words 
After calculation of the term weights of candidate 
terms through fuzzy inference, some candidate 
terms are selected as IRKs based on their weights 
with the constraint that each example document 
should contain at least one or more IRKs. The al-
gorithm for selection of IRKs is given in Figure 2. 
Let us consider the following example to under-
stand our selection procedure. 
i) An example document set, DS, is composed of 
documents d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, and d6. Each 
document contains the following terms:  
d1 = {a, b, f}, d2 = {a, c, d}, d3 = {d, e, f}, 
d4 = {d, f},  d5 = {b, c, e},  d6 = {e, f} 
ii) A candidate term set, TS, is composed of {(a, 
0.9), (b, 0.8), (c, 0.7), (d, 0.6), (e, 0.5), (f, 0.4)}, 
where (ti, TWi) represents that TWi is the term 
weight of term ti. 
If we apply the algorithm in Figure 2 to this ex-
ample, then temporary variables in line 2, 3 and 4 
are initialized. The statement block from line 5 to 
line 14 is executed repeatedly until at least one or 
more IRKs are extracted from every example 
document in DS. Let us assume that the documents 
in the example document set are processed in se-
quence. After the first loop of the statement block 
from line 5 to line 14 is executed, the output value 
of ITS contains only term ?a?. There is no change 
in ITS after the second loop of the block because 
term ?a? has already been included in ITS. After 
d3, the third loop of the block, is processed, a term 
?d? is newly added to ITS. So, there is {a, d} in 
ITS. After d4, d5, and d6 are sequentially proc-
essed, none, term ?b?, and term ?e? are added to 
ITS, respectively. Therefore the algorithm return 
ITS having a set of terms {a, b, d, e}. We can find 
the algorithm in Figure 2 works well according to 
our constraint.

resentative terms 
3.3 Automatic Expansion and Reweighting of  
IRKs 
After the IRKs are selected, additional terms are 
selected to be expanded in the order of their 
weights calculated by the method in Section 3.1. 
Let us assume that 5 terms are used to represent a 
user's preference and the number of IRKs is 3. 
Then, 2 terms with highest weights except IRKs 
are selected additionally. The IRKs and these terms 
constitute the final representative keywords 
(FRKs) and are reweighted by considering the co-
occurrence similarity with IRKs.  For this end, the 
relevance degrees of the FRKs in every document 
are calculated with the equation (6). Each positive 
example document represents user?s preferable 
content. In other words, each document tends to 
contain general or specific or partial contents. We 
regard the IRKs as the essential terms of the given 
positive examples. So, the possibility that the re-
lated terms, e.g., synonym, collocated terms and so 
on, occurred together with these IRKs in the same 
document set increases.

ti in document dk, n is the number of IRKs, p is a 
control parameter. In our experiments, p is set to 
10. The RDik is treated as 0 if it has negative value. 
For example, let K be a set of IRKs consisting 
of k1, k2 and k3 terms and their frequencies in 
document d1 be 4, 3, and 1, respectively. Also, let 
the frequency of term t1 be 2. Then, its relevance 
degree is calculated as follows:

As shown in the above equation, RDik is in-
versely proportional to the sum of term frequency 
difference between initial representative term and 
candidate term. So, the higher is the value of Rd, 
the more similar the co-occurrence is, that is, the 
equation reflects the co-occurrence similarity be-
tween initial representative terms and a candidate 
term appropriately. After calculating the relevance 
degree of a candidate term, the weight of the term 
in the set of example documents is determined by 
the following equation:

is the frequency of term ti in document dk, IDFi is 
the inverse document frequency of term ti, and n is 
the number of example documents. 
The equation (7) is a modification of the Roc-
chio's in Section 2. Different from that equation, 
we additionally use the term relevance degree be-
tween initial representative terms and a candidate 
term. Let us assume that the IDF value of the can-
didate term t1 is 1.0 and it occurs 3, 2, and 1 within 
document d1, d2 and d3, respectively. If the rele-
vance degrees for three documents are also as-
sumed to 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7, respectively, then the 
weight of candidate term ti is calculated as below.

Finally, the weights of the FRKs are calculated 
by the following equation: 
rikii www +=                              (8) 
where, wki, is  the initial weight of term ti. Instead 
of using the weight obtained by fuzzy inference, 
the initial weight wki of term ti is recalculated by 
the equation (9), if the term is in IRKs and other-
wise 0. The equation is the one introduced to as-
sign a weight to an initial query term in IR systems 
based on the vector space model (Baeza-Yates and  
Ribeiro-Neto, 1999).

Let K = {t1, t3, t4} be the set of IRKs, WK = 
{3.0, 2.0, 1.0} be the set of their weights calculated 
by the equation (9), T = {t1, t2, t3, t4, t5} be the 
set of FRKs, and WT = {5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 2.0, 1.0} be 
their weights through the equation (7). Then, we 
can get the final weights of FRKs, {8.0,4.0, 5.0, 
3.0, 1.0}. 
4 Experiments 
We used Reuters-21578 data as an experimental 
document set. This collection has five different sets 
of contents related categories. They are 
EXCHANGES, ORGS, PEOPLE, PLACES and 
TOPICS. Some of the categories set have up to 265 
categories, but some of them have just 39 catego-
ries. We chose the TOPICS categories set which 
has 135 categories. We divided the documents ac-
cording to the ?ModeApte? split. There are 9603 
training documents and 3299 test documents. 
Among the 135 categories, we first chose only 90 
ones that have at least one training example and 
one testing example. Then, we finally selected 21 
categories that have from 10 to 30 training docu-
ments. The 3019 documents of those categories are 
used as testing documents. The document fre-
quency information from 7770 training documents 
in 90 categories is used to calculate IDF values of 
terms. We did not consider negative documents 
under the assumption that only positive documents 
coincident with users? preferences were given im-
plicitly or explicitly . 
Documents are ranked by the cosine similarity 
and the following F-measure (Baeza-Yates and 
Ribeiro-Neto, 1999), which is a weighted combina-
tion of recall and precision and popularly used for 
performance evaluation. Since the maximum value 
for F can be interpreted as the best possible com-
promise between recall and precision, we use this 
maximum value.

First, our method was compared to the Rocchio 
and Widrow-Hoff algorithms. To see the effect of 
the number of FRKs, we made experiments by 
varying it from 5 to 30 in increment 5 and for the 
case that all terms are used.  Table 2 shows the 
overall or summary result of the proposed method 
compared to the two existing algorithms for 
21categories. The result shows that our method is 
better than the others in all cases, especially when 
10 terms are used to represent user preferences. 
Table 3 shows the detail result in that case, i.e. the 
F-values and the performance improvement ratios 
when 10 terms are used. The proposed method has 
achieved about 20% over Rocchio algorithm and 
10% over Widrow-Hoff algorithm on the average.  
When 5 terms are used to represent user prefer-
ences, 19 categories among 21 categories are used 
because ?strategic-metal? and ?pet-chem? catego-
ries do not satisfy the constraint in Section 3.2, i.e., 
5 terms are too few to cover all training documents.

It is not clear which component of our method 
mainly contributes to such improvement since our 
method consists of two main components - one is 
for extracting IRKs, the other for expanding and 
reweighting of IRKs. To analyze our method, we 
made several variants of the proposed method and 
did experiments with them. The variants are named 
by the sequence of the following symbols.  
IF, IR, IW: mean that IRKs are selected based on 
the weight obtained by the method in Section 3.1, 
the Rocchio algorithm, and the Widrow-Hoff algo-
rithm, respectively. 
RC, RR, RW: mean that terms are reweighted by 
the method in Section 3.3, the Rocchio algorithm, 
and the Widrow-Hoff algorithm, respectively. 
EC, EF, ER, EW: mean that expanded terms are 
selected based on the weight obtained by applying 
the method in Section 3.3, the method in Section 
3.1, the Rocchio algorithm, and the Widrow-Hoff 
algorithm, respectively. 
For example, the proposed method in Section 3 is 
named as IF_EF_RC, which means IRKs, and ex-
panded terms are selected based on the weight cal-
culated by the method in Section 3.1 and then 
reweighted by the method in Section 3.3. For an-
other example, the method called by IF_RC_EC 
means that IRKs are selected based on the weight 
obtained by the method in Section 3.1 and then all 
terms are reweighed by the method in Section 3.3 
before expanded terms are selected. 
In the proposed method, fuzzy inference tech-
nique is used to extract IRKs. So, we tried two 
variants, IR_ER_RC and IW_EW_RC, where the 
Rocchio and Widrow-Hoff algorithms are used 
respectively to calculate the representativeness (or 
weights) of terms instead of the method in Section 
3.1, and then IRKs and expanded terms are se-
lected based on these weights. The variants all use 
the reweighting scheme in Section 3.3. Table 4 
shows that other keyword extraction algorithms do 
not show any benefit over the fuzzy inference ap-
proach. We can also observe that when one of the 
existing algorithms is combined with the second 
component of our method, the performance im-
provement over the case that the algorithm solely 
is used is negligible. 
The method to extract IRKs reflecting user?s 
preference directly affects the result of the term 
reweighting process because the process is based 
on the term co-occurrence similarity with the IRKs. 
If the terms that are far from user?s preference are 
extracted as IRKs, then some terms that actually 
are improper in representing user?s information 
needs may be assigned with high weights during 
the reweighting process and then the final vector 
generated from the results may be disqualified 
from representing user?s preferences. So, we can 
know that our fuzzy inference technique is effec-
tive to extract IRKs from the results in Table 4. 
To demonstrate the usefulness of the second 
part of our method, i.e., the expansion and re-
weighting technique, we also tried the 5 variants of 
our method (IF_RC_EC, IF_RR_ER, IF_RW_EW, 
IF_EF_RR, IF_EF_RW). Table 5 shows the all 
variants are not better than the original though they 
outperform Rocchio and Widrow-Hoff algorithms. 
5 Conclusions 
In this study, we apply fuzzy inference technique 
and term reweighting scheme based on the term 
co-occurrence similarity to the problem that extract 
important keywords representing contents of 
documents presented by users. We have conducted 
extensive experiments on the Reuters-21578 col-
lection. The results show that our method outper-
forms two well-known training algorithms for 
linear text classifiers. Moreover, some variants of 
our method have been explored to analyze the 
characteristics of our method. Though this paper 
only describes how to extract user preferences 
from example documents, the technique will be 
applicable to several areas such as query modifica-
tion in IR, user profile modification in information 
filtering, text summarization and so forth directly 
or with some modifications.  
Since only positive examples are considered in 
our method, the method is not applicable to a 
document set containing negative examples. For 
covering negative examples, it needs to modify the 
fuzzy inference rules with considering additional 
input variables.  The proposed method was also 
designed for a small set of documents. So, we 
could not achieve performance improvement as 
described in this paper when our method is applied 
to a large set of documents. However, such a prob-
lem will be alleviated if clustering techniques are 
used together as in (Alberto et al, 2001; Lam and 
Ho, 1998; Ugur et al, 2000).
