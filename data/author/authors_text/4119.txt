Abstract 
We report on a small study undertaken to 
demonstrate the feasibility of combining 
portable information extraction with MT in 
order to support translingual information 
access. After describing the proposed 
system's usage scenario and system design, 
we describe our investigation of transferring 
information extraction techniques developed 
for English to Korean. We conclude with a 
brief discussion of related MT issues we plan 
to investigate in future work. 
1 Introduction 
In this paper, we report on a small study 
undertaken to demonstrate the feasibility of 
combining portable information extraction with 
MT in order to support ranslingual information 
access. The goal of our proposed system is to 
better enable analysts to perform information 
filtering tasks on foreign language documents. 
This effort was funded by a SBIR Phase I award 
from the U.S. Army Research Lab, and will be 
pursued further under the DARPA TIDES 
initiative. 
Information extraction (IE) systems are 
designed to extract specific types of information 
from natural language texts. In order to achieve 
acceptable accuracy, IE systems need to be 
tuned for a given topic domain. Since this 
domain tuning can be labor intensive, recent IE 
research has focused on developing learning 
algorithms for training IE system components 
(cf. Cardie, 1997, for a survey). To date, 
however, little work has been done on IE 
systems for languages other than English 
(though cf. MUC-5, 1994, and MUC-7, 1998, 
for Japanese IE systems); and, to our knowledge, 
none of the available techniques for the core task 
of learning information extraction patterns have 
been extended or evaluated for multilingual 
information extraction (though again cf. MUC-7, 
1998, where the use of learning techniques for 
the IE subtasks of named entity recognition and 
coreference r solution are described). 
Given this situation, the primary objective of 
our study was to demonstrate he feasibility of 
using portable--i.e., easily trainable--IE 
technology on Korean documents, focusing on 
techniques for learning information extraction 
patterns. Secondary objectives of the study were 
to elaborate the analyst scenario and system 
design. 
2 Analyst Scenario

might use the proposed system:

documents in which to search for

Figure 1 
The analyst selects one or more scenario 
template, to activate in the query. Each 
scenario template corresponds to a specific 
type of event. Available scenario templates 
might include troop movements, acts of 
violence, meetings and negotiathms, 
protests, etc. In Figure 1, the selected event 
is of type meeting (understood broadly). 
The analyst fills in the available slots of the 
selected scenario template in order to restrict 
the search to the information considered to 
be relevant. In Figure 1, the values specified 
in the scenario template indicate that the 
information to f'md is about meetings having 
as location South Korea and as issue North 
Korea and missiles. The analyst also 
32  
specifies what information s/he wants to be 
reported when information matching the 
query is found. In Figure 1, the selected 
boxes under the Report column indicate that 
all information found satisfying the query 
should be reported except for the meeting 
participants. 1 
? Once the analyst submits the query for 
evaluation, the system searches the input 
documents for information matching the 
query. As a result, a hypertext document is 
generated describing the information 
matching the query as well as the source of 
this information. Note that the query 
contains English keywords that are 
automatically translated into Korean prior to 
matching. The extracted information is 
presented in English after being translated 
from Korean. In Figure 1, the generated 
hypertext response indicates two documents 
in the input set that matched the query 
totally or in part. Each summary in the 
response includes just the translations of the 
extracted information that the analyst 
requested to be reported. 
? For each document extract matching the 
analyst query, the analyst can obtain a 
complete machine translation of the Korean 
document where the match was found, and 
where the matched information is 
highlighted. Working with a human 
translator, the analyst can also verify the 
accuracy of the reported information by 
accessing the documents in their original 
language. 
3 System Design 
Figure 2 shows the high-level design of the 
system. It consists of the following components: 
? The User Interface. The browser-based 
interface is for entering queries and 
displaying the resulting presentations. 
? The Portable Information Extractor (PIE) 
component. The PIE component uses the 
While in this example the exclusion of participant 
information in the resulting report is rather artificial, 
in general a scenario template may contain many 
different ypes of information, not all of which are 
likely to interest an analyst at once. 
Extraction Pattem Library - -  which 
contains the set of extraction patterns 
learned in the lab, one set per scenario 
template - -  to extract specific types of 
information from the input Korean 
documents, once parsed. 
? The Ranker component. This component 
ranks the extracted information returned by 
the PIE component according to how well it 
matches the keyword restrictions in the 
query. The MT component's English-to- 
Korean Transfer Lexicon is used to map the 
English keywords to corresponding Korean 
ones. When the match falls below a user- 
? configurable threshold, the extracted 
information is filtered out. 
? The MT component. The MT component 
(cf. Lavoie et al, 2000) translates the 
extracted Korean phrases or sentences into 
corresponding English ones. 
? The Presentation Generator component. 
This component generates well-organized, 
easy-to-read hypertext presentations by 
organizing and formatting the ranked 
extracted information. It uses existing NLG 
components, including the Exemplars text 
planning framework (White and Caldwell, 
1998) and the RealPro syntactic realizer 
(Lavoie and Rainbow, 1997). 
In our feasibility study, the majority of the effort 
went towards developing the PIE component, 
described in the next section. This component 
was implemented in a general way, i.e. in a way 
that we would expect to work beyond the 
specific training/test corpus described below. In 
contrast, we only implemented initial versions of 
the User Interface, Ranker and Presentation 
Generator components, in order to demonstrate 
the system concept; that is, these initial versions 
were only intended.to work with our training/test 
corpus, and will require considerable further 
development prior to reaching operational status. 
For the MT component, we used an early 
version of the lexical transfer-based system 
currently under development in an ongoing 
SBIR Phase II project (cf. Nasr et al, 1997; 
Palmer et al, 1998; Lavoie et al, 2000), though 
with a limited lexicon specifically for translating 
the slot fillers in our training/test corpus.

4.1 Scenario Template and Training/Fest 
Corpus 
For our Phase I feasibility demonstration, we 
chose a minimal scenario template for meeting 
and negotiation events consisting of one or more 
participant slots plus optional date and location 
slots. 2 We then gathered a small corpus of thirty 
articles by searching for articles containing 
"North Korea" and one or more of about 15 
keywords. The first two sentences (with a few 
exceptions) were then annotated with the slots to 
be extracted, leading to a total of 51 sentences 
containing 47 scenario templates and 89 total 
2 In the end, we did not use the 'issue' slot shown in 
Figure 1, as it contained more complex Idlers than 
those that ypically have been handled in IE systems. 
correct slots. Note that in a couple of cases 
more than one template was given for a single 
long sentence. 
When compared to the MUC scenario 
template task, our extraction task was 
considerably simpler, for the following reasons: 
* The answer keys only contained information 
that could be found within a single sentence, 
i.e. the answer keys did not require merging 
information across entences. 
? The answer keys did not require anaphoric 
references to be resolved, and we did not 
deal with conjuncts eparately. 
? We did not attempt o normalize dates or 
remove appositives from NPs. 
4.2 Extraction Pattern Learning 
For our feasibility study, we chose to follow the 
AutoSlog (Lehnert et al, 1992; Riloff, 1993) 
approach to extraction pattern acquisition. In 
this approach, extraction patterns are acquired

via a one-shot general-to-specific learning 
algorithm designed specifically for the 
information extraction task. 3 The learning 
algorithm is straightforward and depends only 
on the existence of a (partial) parser and a small 
set of general inguistic patterns that direct the 
creation of specific patterns. As a training 
corpus, it requires a set of texts with noun 
phrases annotated with the slot type to be 
extracted. 
To adapt the AutoSlog approach to Korean, 
we first devised Korean equivalents of the 
English patterns, two of which are shown in 
Figure 3. It turned out that for our corpus, we 
could collapse some of these patterns, though 
some new ones were also needed. In the end we 
used just nine generic patterns. 
Important issues that arose in adapting the 
approach were (1) greater flexibility in word 
order and heavier reliance on morphological 
cues in Korean, and (2) the predominance of 
light verbs (verbs with little semantic ontent of 
their own) and aspectual verbs in the chosen 
domain. We discuss these issues in the next two 
sections. 
4.3 Korean Parser 
We used Yoon's hybrid statistical Korean parser 
(Yoon et al, 1997, 1999; Yoon, 1999) to process 
the input sentences prior to extraction. The 
parser incorporates a POS tagger and

learning algorithms, as well as active learning 
techniques, such as those described in Thompson et 
al. (1999). 
morphological nalyzer and yields a dependency 
representation as its output? The use of a 
dependency representation e abled us to handle 
the greater flexibility in word order in Korean. 
To facilitate pattern matching, we wrote a 
simple program to convert he parser's output o 
XML form. During the XML conversion, two 
simple heuristics were applied, one to recover 
implicit subjects, and another to correct a 
recurring misanalysis of noun compounds. 
4.4 Trigger Word Filtering and 
Generalization 
In the newswire corpus we looked at, meeting 
events were rarely described with the verb 
'mannata' ('to meet'). Instead, they were 
usually described with a noun that stands for 
'meeting' and a light or aspectual verb, for 
example, 'hoyuy-lul kacta' ('to have a meeting') 
or 'hoyuy-lul machita' ('to finish a meeting'). 
In order to acquire extraction patterns that made 
appropriate use of such collocations, we decided 
to go beyond the AutoSlog approach and 
explicitly group trigger words (such as 'hoyuy') 
into classes, and to likewise group any 
collocations, such as those involving light verbs 
or aspectual verbs. To fmd collocations for the 
trigger words, we reviewed a Korean lexical co- 
occurrence base which was constructed from a 
corpus of 40 million words (Yoon et al, 1997). 
We then used the resulting specification to filter 
the learned patterns to just those containing the

89.4% (Yoon, 1999). 
35 
. - !  
trigger words or trigger word collocations, as 
well as to generalize the patterns to the word 
class level. Because the number of tr:igger 
words is small, this specification can be done 
quickly, and soon pays off in terms of time 
saved in manually filtering the learned patterns. 
4.5 Results 
In testing our approach, we obtained overall 
results of 79% recall and 67% precision in a 
hold-one-out cross validation test. In a cross 
validation test, one repeatedly divides a corpus 
into different raining and test sets, averaging the 
results; in the hold-one-out version, the system 
is tested on a held-out example after being 
trained on the rest. In the IE setting, the recall 
measure is the number of correct slots found 
divided by the total number of correct slots, 
while the precision measure is the number of 
correct slots found divided by the total number 
of slots found. 
While direct comparisons with the MUC 
conference results cannot be made for the 
reasons we gave above, we nevertheless 
consider these results quite promising, as these 
scores exceed the best scores reported at MUC-6 
on the scenario template task. 5

A breakdown by slot is shown in Table 1. We 
may note that precision is low for date and 
location slots because we used a simplistic 
sentence-level merge, rather than dependencies. 
To measure the impact of our approach to 
generalization, we may compare the results in 
5 
http://www.nist.gov/itl/div894/894.02/related_project 
s/tipster/muc.htm 
Table 1 with those shown in Table 2, where 
generalization is not used. As can be seen, the 
generalization step adds substantially to overall 
recall. 
To illustrate the effect of generalization, 
consider the pattern to extract he subject NP of 
the light verb 'kac (hold)' when paired with an 
object NP headed by the noun 'hyepsang 
(negotiation)'. Since this pattern only occurs 
once in our corpus, the slot is not successfully 
extracted in the cross-validation test without 
generalization. However, since this example 
does fall under the more generalized pattern of 
extracting the subject NP of a verb in the light 
verb class when paired with an object NP 
headed by a noun the 'hoytam-hyepsang' class, 
the slot is successfully extracted in the cross- 
validation test using the generalized patterns. 
Cases like these are the source of the 18% boost 
in recall of participant slots, from 57% to 75%. 
5 Discussion 
Our feasibility study has focused our attention 
on several questions concerning the interaction 
of IE and MT, which we hope to pursue under 
the DARPA TIDES initiative. One question is 
the extent o which slot filler translation is more 
practicable than general-purpose MT; one would 
expect to achieve much higher quality on slot 
fillers, as they are typically relatively brief noun 
phrases, and instantiation of a slot implies a 
degree of semantic lassification. On the other 
hand, one might find that higher quality is 
required in order to take translated phrases out 
of their original context. Another question is 
how to automate the construction of bilingual 
lexicons. An important issue here will be how 
to combine information from different sources, 
given that automatically acquired lexical 
information is apt to be less reliable, though 
domain-specific.
