Accurate analysis of the temporal expression is cru- 
cial for Korean text processing applications uch 
as information extraction and clmnking for efficient 
syntactic analysis. It is a complicated problem since 
temporal expressions often have the ambiguity of 
syntactic roles. This t)al)er discusses two problenm: 
(1) representing and identiflying the temporal expres- 
sion (2) distinguishing the syntactic tim(lion of the 
temporal exI)ression in case it has a dual syntac- 
tic role. In this paper, temporal expressions and 
the context for disambiguation which is called local 
context are represented using lexical data extracted 
fiom corlms and the finite state transducer. By ex- 
periments, it; turns out that the method is eflimtive 
for temporal expression analysis. In particular, our 
al)t)roach shows the corI)us-based work could make 
a promising result for the t)roblem in a restricted 
domain in t, hat we can eflbctievely deal with a, large 
size of lexical data. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Accurate analysis of the temporal expression is cru- 
cial tbr text processing aplflications uch as informa- 
tion extraction and for chunking for efficient syntac- 
tic analysis. In information extraction, a user might 
want to get a piece of information about an event. 
Typically, the event is related with (late or time,, 
which is represented by temporal expression. 
Chunking is helpflfl for efficient syntactic analy- 
sis by removing irrelevant intermediate constituents 
generated through parsing. It involves the task to 
divide sentences into non-overlatli)ing segments. As 
a result of chunking, parsing would be a problem of 
analysis inside chunks and between chunks (Yoon, et 
al., 1999). Chunking prevents the parser fl'om pro- 
ducing intermediate structures irrelevant o a final 
output, which makes the parser etticient without los- 
ing accuracy. Thus, it turns out that chunking is an 
essential stage tbr the application system like MT 
that should pursue both efficiency and precision. 
Korean, an agglutinative language, has well- 
developed flmctional words such as postposition 
and ending by which the grammatical fimction of 
a phrase is decisively determined. Besides, because 
it is a head final language and so the head always 
follows its complement, the chunking is relatively 
easy. However, we are also faced with an mnbiguity 
problem in chunking, which is often due to the tem- 
poral expression. This is because inany temporal 
nouns are used as the modifier of noun and vert) in 
a sentence. Let us consider the tbllowing examI)les:

Ill the examples, each temporal expression plays a 
syntactically different role used as noun phrase or 
adverbial phrase (The undeJ'lined is a phrase) al- 
though they comprise the same phrasal fornls. Tile 
temporal expressions in la  and 2a of the example 
serve as tile temporal adverb to modify predicates. 
On the other hand, the temporal expressions iu lb 
and 2b are used as the modifier of other nouns. That 
is, as a temporal noun either contributes to construc- 
tion of a noun compound or modifies a predicate, it; 
causes a structural aml)iguity. 
One sohltion might be that the POS tagger as- 
signs a different ag to each temporal noun e.g. NN 
954 
mid ADV'. However, since (let/en(len(:ies of teml)oral 
llOllllS .~l, re lexically (lecided, it does not seem that 
their synta('t;ic ta.gs could tie ac(:urately t)redi(:ted 
with a relatively small size of PeG tagged (:orl)uS. 
Also, the siml)le rule based a.1)l/roach Callliol; litake

such, identification of temi)oral expression is a coin-

claimed that the formalism of finite automata could 
be easily used to represent them. 
3 Acquiring Co-occurrence of 
Temporal Expression 
3.1 Categorizing Temporal Nouns 
Since many words have in common a similar mean- 
ing and flmction, they can be categorized by their 
features. So do temporal nouns. That is, we say that 
'Sunday' and 'Monday' have the same features and 
so would take the similar behavior patterns uch as 
co-occurring with the similar words in a sentence or 
phrase. Hence, in the frst  place we categorize tem- 
poral nouns according to their meaning and func- 
tion. We first select 259 temporal nouns and divide 
them into 26 classes as shown in Table 1. Among 
them, some temporal words have syntactic duality 
and others play one syntactic role. Thus, the dis- 
ambiguation process would be applied only to the 
words with dual syntactic functions. 
3.2 Acquisition of Temporal Expressions 
f rom Corpus 
Temporal words would be combined with each other 
in order to be made reference to time, which is called 
temporal expression. Since a temt)oral expression is 
typically composed of one or a few temt)oral words, 
it seems to be possible to describe a grammar of 
modifying noun 
jeonlsilll-eUll nlasisseossda

Figure 2: Syntactic flmctional ainbiguity of tcnlpo- 
ral expression 
the temporal expression with a simple model like fi- 
nite automata. Ill tile practical system, however, we 
are confronted with a complicated problenl in treat- 
ing teml)oral expressions since many temporal words 
have a functional ambiguity used as both a nominal 
and predicate modifier. For instance, a temporal 
noun oneul(today) could play a different role in the 
similar situation as shown in Figure 2. In the first 
and the second path, the words to follow oneul are all 
noun, but the roles (dependency rela;ions) of oncul 
are different. 
Accurate classitication of their syntactic flmctions 
is crucial for the application system since great dif- 
ference would be made according to accuracy of the 
dependency result. Practically, we therefore should 
take into consideration the structural ambiguity res- 
olution as well as their representation itself in identi-

Although the syntactic function of a temporal ex- 
pression would be nondeterministically selected fl'om 
the context, temporal expressions and the lexical 
data of local context can be represented in a de- 
terministic way due to their finite length. For the 
deterministic FST, we define the partial functions ? 
and ? where q?a = q' iffd(q, a) = {q'} and q,a = w' 
iff ?q' E Q such that q?a = q' and 5(q, a, q') = {w'} 
(R.oche and Schabes, 1995). Then, a nubsequential

where the rules are extracted fi'om corl}us. 
4 .2  Clmnk ing  
After the FST of temporal exi}ressiolls adds to words 
syntactic tags such as TN and TA, chunking is {:on- 
ducted with results t iom outl)uts 1)y the Fsr\] '. As we 
said earlier, {:lmnking in Kore.an is relatively easy 
only if the teml}oral ext}ression would l)e suc{:e.ss- 
fltlly recognized. Actually, our clmnker is also 1)ased 
on the finite, state lnachine. The tbllowing is an ex- 
ample tbr chunking rule.s. 
(Nl~h,.,~) -? (NP) I (TNP) 
(NP) -~ (N)* (NP) I (N)* (Nu)* (uN) 
('rNu) -~ ('rN)* (N)* (NP) 
Here, N is a noun without any 1)ostl)osition, N/? is 
a noun with a postposition, TN is a temporal noun 
recoglfized as modii~ying a succeeding 1101111, NU is 
a numbe.r and UN is a unit noun. Aft, er tcmI)oral 
tagging, the chunker transforms 'NT'  into N, NP, 
(~tc. according to morphological constituents and 
their POS. Brietly: the rule. says that an NP clmnk is 
made fl'om either NP or temporal NIL An NP would 
1)e (:onst, rll(;te.(1 with one. or lnOl'O llOlllIS and their 
m{}{lifie{~ {)r with a noun quantified. A TNP, whi{:h 
is re, lated with time, is made fr{)m nouns mo(liticd

FST. By identification {)f t('mt){}ral ex\]}ression and

Table 3: Reduction of candidates resulted from 
chunking 
sults from identit:ying temporal expressions and dis- 
aml/iguatil~g their syntactic functions. From the re- 
sult in the table we see that the method is very effec- 
t, ive in that it very accurately identifies all tile tem- 
poral expressions aim assigns them syntactic tags. 
And, Table 2 shows the reduction resulted from 
chunking after temporal expression identification. 
We take into consideration the average numl)cr of 
head candidates for each word since our parser is 
dependency based one. The test was conducted on 
the tirst file (about 800 sentences) of KAIST tree- 
bank (Choict  al. , 1994). The number was reduced 
by 51% in candidates compared to the system with 
no chunking, whMl makes pa.rsing efficient. 
Most of errors were caused by tile case where tein- 
poral words have different syntactic roles under the 
same context. In this case, the global context such as 
the whole sentence or intcrscnt;cntial infornlation or 
sometimes very soi)histicated processing ixneeded to 
resolve the prol)lem, l~br instance, '82 ~tycoTt(year) 
h, yco'njac-yi(now/Gl;N)' could be used two-.way. If 
the speech time is the year 1982, then h, yeou(fl, e-yi are 
conlbined with 82 nycon to represent time. Other- 
wise, 82 does not ino(til~y hycordac-yi, wlfich cannot 
be recognized only with the local context. Neverthe- 
less, the system is promising in that generally it can 
ilnprove e\[flciency without losing accuracy which is 
crucial for the pracl;ical system. 
6 Conclusions 
hi this paper, we presented a method for identifi- 
cation of temporal exi)ressions and their syntactic 
functions based on FST aim lexical data extracted 
fl:om corpus. Since tenlporal words have the syntac- 
tic ambiguity when used in a sentence, it; is impo> 
tant to identify the syntactic functioll as well as the 
temporal expression itself. 
For the purpose, we manually extracted lexical c(> 
occurrences t?om large corpus aim it was possible as 
the number of temporal nouns is tractable nough 
to manipulate lexical data t)y hand. As shown in 
tile result, lexical co-occurrences are crucial for dis- 
mnbiguating the syntactic flmction of the tenlporal 
expression. Besides, the finite state approach pro- 
vide(l an eftieient model for temporal expression pro- 
cessing. Combined with the clmnker, it helped re- 
nmrkably lessen, by 1)runing irrelewmt candidates, 
intermediate structures generated while parsing.
