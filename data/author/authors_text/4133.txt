Abstract
This study presents a method to automat-
ically acquire paraphrases using bilingual
corpora, which utilizes the bilingual de-
pendency relations obtained by projecting
a monolingual dependency parse onto the
other language sentence based on statisti-
cal alignment techniques. Since the para-
phrasing method is capable of clearly disam-
biguating the sense of an original phrase us-
ing the bilingual context of dependency re-
lation, it would be possible to obtain inter-
changeable paraphrases under a given con-
text. Also, we provide an advanced method
to acquire generalized translation knowl-
edge using the extracted paraphrases. We
applied the method to acquire the gener-
alized translation knowledge for Korean-
English translation. Through experiments
with parallel corpora of a Korean and En-
glish language pairs, we show that our para-
phrasing method effectively extracts para-
phrases with high precision, 94.3% and
84.6% respectively for Korean and English,
and the translation knowledge extracted
from the bilingual corpora could be general-
ized successfully using the paraphrases with
the 12.5% compression ratio.
1 Introduction
Approaches based on bilingual corpora are promis-
ing for the automatic acquisition of translation
knowledge. Phrase-based SMT(Statistical Machine
Translation) models have advanced the state of the
art in machine translation by expanding the basic
unit of translation from words to phrases, which al-
lows the local reordering of words and translation
of multi-word expressions(Chiang, 2007) (Koehn
et al, 2003) (Och and Ney, 2004).
However phrase-based SMT techniques suffer
from data sparseness problems, that is; unreliable
translation probabilities of low frequency phrases
and low coverage in that many phrases encountered
at run-time are not observed in the training data.
An alternative for these problems is to utilize para-
phrases. An unknown phrase can be replaced with
its paraphrase that is already known. Moreover, we
can smooth the phrase translation probability using
the class of paraphrases.
On the other hand, EBMT or PBMT systems
might translate a given sentence fast and robustly
geared by sentence translation patterns or general-
ized transfer rules. Since it costs too much to con-
struct the translation knowledge, they suffer from
the problem of knowledge acquisition bottleneck.
In this study, we present a method of automat-
ically extracting paraphrases from bilingual cor-
pora. Furthermore, we introduce a new method
for acquiring the generalized translation knowledge.
The translation knowledge is a kind of verb sub-
categorization pattern composed of bilingual depen-
dency relations. We obtain the generalized trans-
lation knowledge by grouping the equivalent con-
stituent phrases. The task of identifying the phrases
equivalent to each other is defined as paraphrasing.
Our paraphrasing method utilizes bilingual cor-
pora and alignment techniques in SMT. Unlike pre-
327
vious approaches which identify paraphrases using
a phrase in another language as a pivot without con-
text information (Bannard et al, 2005), or apply
the distributional hypothesis to paths in dependency
trees for inferring paraphrasing rules from monolin-
gual corpora(Lin et al, 2001), we take the bilingual
context of a bilingual dependency relation into ac-
count for disambiguating the sense of paraphrases.
First, we create a large inventory of bilingual de-
pendency relations and equate the pairs of depen-
dency relations that are aligned with a single depen-
dency relation in the other language as paraphrased
dependency relations. Then, we extract the phrases
sharing the same head (or modifier) phrase among
the paraphrased dependency relations aligned with a
unique dependency relation in the other language.
We regard them as conceptually equivalent para-
phrases. This work is based on the assumption of
similar meaning when multiple phrases map onto a
single foreign language phrase that is the converse of
the assumption made in the word sense disambigua-
tion work(Diab and Resnik, 2002). The two-step
paraphrasing method allows us to increase the pre-
cision of the paraphrases by constraining the para-
phrase candidates under the bilingual contexts of de-
pendency relations.
In order to systematically acquire the generalized
translation knowledge, our method includes follow-
ing steps:
? Derive a bilingually parsed sentence through
projecting the source language parse onto the
word/phrase aligned target sentence.
? Extract bilingual dependency relations from the
bilingual dependency parses.
? Acquire paraphrases by exploiting the ex-
tracted bilingual dependency relations.
? Generalize the bilingual dependency relations
by substituting the phrases with their para-
phrase class.
2 Extracting Translation Patterns
In this section, we introduce a method to acquire
translation knowledge like a bilingual dependency
pattern using bilingual corpus. The bilingual depen-
dency pattern is defined as an asymmetric binary re-
lationship between a phrase called head and another
phrase called modifier which are paired with their
corresponding translations in the other language. In
order to acquire the bilingual dependency relations,
we do bilingual dependency parsing based on the
word/phrase alignments and extract bilingual depen-
dency relations by navigating the dependency parse
tree.
2.1 Bilingual Dependency Parsing based on
Word/Phrase Alignment
Given an input sentence pair, a source language sen-
tence is dependency parsed in a base phrase level
and a target language sentence is chunked by a shal-
low parser. During the dependency parsing and the
chunking, each sentence is also segmented into mor-
phemes and we regard a morpheme as a word.
We make word alignments through the learning
of IBM models by using the GIZA++ toolkit(Och
and Ney, 2000): we learn the translation model
toward IBM model 4, initiating translation itera-
tions from IBM model 1 with intermediate HMM
model iterations. For improving the word align-
ment, we use the word-classes that are trained from a
monolingual corpus using the srilm toolkit(Stolcke,
2002). Then, we do phrase alignments based on the
word alignments, which are consistent with the base
phrase boundaries as well as the word alignments as
(Hwang et al, 2007) did. A phrase is defined as a
word sequence that is covered by a base phrase se-
quence, not by a single sub-tree in a syntactic parse
tree.
After the word and the phrase alignments, we
obtain bilingual dependency parses by sharing the
dependency relations of a monolingual dependency
parser among the aligned phrases. The bilingual de-
pendency parsing is similar to the technique of bilin-
gual parsing in a word level described in (Hwa et al,
2005)(Quirk et al, 2005). Our bilingual parsing in a
phrase level has an advantage of being capable of re-
ducing not only the parsing complexity but also the
errors caused by structural differences between two
languages, such like a Korean and English pairs1.
For bilingual parsing between Korean and En-
glish, we use a Korean dependency parse on the
1Since we regard that a phrase in a source language sentence
is aligned with a target phrase if at least one word in a source
phrase is aligned with the words in a target phrase, we robustly
project the source phrases onto the target phrases.

source language side as a pivot. Figure 1 shows an
illustration of bilingual dependency parsing between
Korean and English based on the word/phrase align-
ments. The dependency structure induced on the tar-
get language side is in some sense isomorphic to the
structure of the source language.
2.2 Extracting Bilingual Dependency Patterns
Starting from the head phrase of a given source lan-
guage sentence, we extract bilingual dependency re-
lations by traversing a bilingual dependency parse
tree. A dependency relation is a binary relation be-
tween a head and modifier phrases. Each phrase is
paired with its corresponding translation. For effec-
tively using them during the decoding or the sen-
tence generation, we attach an additional tag for in-
dicating the order(e.g. Reverse or Forward) of target
language phrases to the bilingual dependency rela-
tion. A dependency pattern refers to the bilingual
dependency relation with the phrase order tag.
Figure 1(c) shows some examples of bilingual de-
pendency patterns extracted from the bilingual de-
pendency parse tree in Figure 1(b). In the exam-
ple, Korean phrase ?sinae ga neun? aligned with
the English phrase ?for downtown? modifies the
phrase ?bus siganpyo? aligned with the English ?the
bus timetable?. Through traversing the dependency
parse trees, we acquire the bilingual dependency
pattern <sinae ga neun:for downtown, bus sigan-
pyo:the bus timetable;Reverse>.
If we apply the bilingual dependency pattern
<sinae ga neun:for downtown, bus siganpyo:the
bus timetable;Reverse> for machine translation of
a given Korean expression ?sinae ga neun bus sigan-
pyo?, we might generate an English phrase ?the bus
timetable for downtown? by reversing the order of
English head and modifier phrase corresponding to
the Korean phrase ?sinae ga neun bus siganpyo?.
3 Acquisition of Paraphrases
Paraphrasing is based on the assumption that if
multiple Korean phrases are equivalent to each
other, they can be translated into a single English
phrase. But, the reverse is not always true. That
is, even though a single phrase in a source lan-
guage sentence maps onto multiple phrases in a
foreign language sentence, the phrases might not
be paraphrases. For example, two different Ko-
rean phrases, ?gyedan/{stairs,steps}? and ?baldong-
jak/steps?, might be translated into a single English
phrase ?the steps?. But since the meaning of two
Korean phrases is not equivalent to each other, the
Korean phrases cannot be paraphrases. This implies
that the sense of candidate paraphrases should be
disambiguated depending on a given context.
For extracting the paraphrases of which sense is
disambiguated under a given context, we give a
strong constraint on paraphrases with bilingual con-
text evidence of dependency relation denoted as R(x,
y) :
329
Figure 2: Illustration of Paraphrasing based on Bilingual Dependency Relations
R(ei, ej) ? R(kai , kaj ) and R(ei?, ej?) ? R(kai? , kaj? ) (1)
? R(kai , kaj ) ? R(kai? , kaj? )
where the relation of R(ei, ej) = R(ei?, ej?) with the
condition of ei = ei? and ej = ej? .
R(ei, ej) ? R(kai , kaj ) and R(kai , kaj ) ? R(kai? , kaj? ) (2)
? kai ? kai? iff kaj ? kaj?
For the identification of paraphrases, we equate the
different dependency relations aligned with a unique
dependency relation in the other language and regard
them as a set of paraphrased dependency relations
(see eq.(1)). Under the constraint of the paraphrased
dependency relations, we again try to acquire para-
phrases at a phrase level. That is, we extract the
phrases sharing the same head/modifier phrase in
paraphrased dependency relations as a phrase para-
phrase under a given bilingual dependency context
(see eq.(2)).
Figure 2 shows some examples of paraphrased de-
pendency relations and paraphrases. In Figure 2 (a),
the Korean dependency relations <bus siganpyo,
sinae ga neun>,<bus seukejul, sinae ga neun> and
<bus seukejul, sinae banghyang> mapped onto the
English relation<the bus timetable, for downtown>
are the paraphrases. Under the condition of para-
phrased dependency relations, the phrases, ?bus
seukejul? and ?bus siganpyo? modified by the same
phrase ?sinae ga neun? are extracted as paraphrases.
In the same way, the set of modifier phrases,
p1={?sinae banghyang?, ?sinae ga neun?} is ac-
quired as a paraphrase set. For English, we obtain
the set of paraphrases, p3={?the bus timetable?, ?the
bus schedule?} as we did for Korean.
The induced set of paraphrases can be applied
to dependency relations to extend the set through
higher inference as in Figure 2(b). We replace a
phrase, which is a part of a bilingual dependency
relation and a member of a paraphrase set with the
representative phrase of the paraphrase set. And we
repeatedly apply the paraphrase extraction algorithm
to the bilingual dependency relations of which a part
is replaced with the previously acquired paraphrase
set. Finally, we can acquire new paraphrase sets
such as p4 and p5.
4 Generalizing Translation Patterns
The acquired paraphrases can be utilized for various
NLP applications. In this work, we focus on mak-
ing use of the paraphrases to generalize the trans-
lation knowledge of bilingual dependency patterns.
By generalizing the bilingual dependency patterns,
we aim at increasing the coverage of them without
any over-generation.
The algorithm for generalizing bilingual depen-
dency patterns is very simple. The main idea
is to replace the constituent phrases of a given
bilingual dependency pattern with their paraphrase
classes. The paraphrase classes are extracted un-
der the condition of a given bilingual context as
follows: < PP (km, dpi) : PP (em, dpi), PP (kh, dpi) :
PP (eh, dpi);Order := Reverse|Forward > where the
330
Figure 3: Illustration of Generalizing Bilingual Dependency Patterns
function, PP (x, y) returns the identifier of the para-
phrase set of a given phrase x, which is constrained
on a given context y = dpi; km and kh denote a
modifier and a head in Korean, respectively and em
and eh denote the English phrases.
Figure 3 shows an illustration of generalizing the
translation patterns using the previously acquired
paraphrase classes. In the pattern dpi, the English
modifier ?for downtown? uses the phrase itself be-
cause there is no paraphrase class. But, the others
are generalized by using their paraphrase classes.
5 Experiments
We used the Basic Travel Expression Corpus
(BTEC)(Takezawa et al, 2002), a collection of con-
versational travel phrases for Korean and English.
We used 152,175 sentences in parallel corpus for
training and 10,146 sentences for test. The Korean
sentences were automatically dependency parsed by
in-house dependency parser and the English sen-
tences were chunked by in-house shallow parser.
Through experiments, we investigated the accu-
racy of the acquired paraphrases, and the compres-
sion ratio of the generalized translation patterns
compared to the raw translation patterns. Moreover,
we show the strength of utilizing bilingual context
information in the acquisition of paraphrases with
the comparison to the previous approach.
5.1 Accuracy of the Acquired Paraphrases
Through the alignments and bilingual dependency
parsing, we extracted 66,664 bilingual dependency
relations. 24.15% of Korean phrases and 21.8% of
English phrases are paraphrased with more than two
phrases under a given bilingual dependency context.
The statistics of Korean and English paraphrases
based on bilingual dependency relations is shown in
Table 1.
Especially, the paraphrasing ratio of the Korean
head phrases, 28.63% is higher than that of the
English heads,22.6%. Many of the Korean head
phrases are verb phrases that reflects the honorific
and inflectional characteristics of Korean language.
We might expect that the problems caused by vari-
ous honorific expressions can be resolved with the
paraphrases such like {?ga r geoyeyo?, ?ga gess-
seupnida?}.
For evaluating the accuracy of the acquired para-
phrases, we randomly selected 100 sets of para-
phrases for Korean and English phrase respectively.
Because the accuracy of paraphrases can vary de-
pending on context, we selected the dependency re-
lations that contain a phrase in a paraphrase set from
the test set. And we generated the dependency re-
lations by substituting the phrase by the other para-
phrases. Accuracy was judged by two native speak-
ers for each language. We measured the percentage
of completely interchangeable paraphrases under a
given bilingual dependency context.
Table 1 shows the performance of the paraphrases
depending on their bilingual context. The accuracy
of Korean and English paraphrases are 94.6% and
84.6% respectively. Korean paraphrases are more
accurate than English paraphrases. Especially the
quality of Korean head paraphrases(97.5%) is very
high.
Since we used a simple base-phrase chunker for
English, where most base phrases except for noun
phrases are composed of single words, most of En-
glish phrases aligned to Korean phrases were depen-
dent on the word alignments. Big structural differ-
ence between Korean and English made the word
alignments more difficult. These alignment results
might influence not only the paraphrasing ratio but
331

also the performance of the paraphrases.
Nevertheless, our paraphrasing method outper-
formed previous approaches which do not use bilin-
gual dependency context. Because the paraphrasing
methods are different, we could not compare them
directly. But, we tried to make similar experimental
condition on the same BTEC corpus by implement-
ing the previous approach(Bannard et al, 2005).
When evaluating the previous approach, the accu-
racy of (Bannard et al, 2005) was 71.4% and 76.2%
for Korean and English paraphrases, respectively.
The results show that our paraphrasing method can
acquire the paraphrases of higher quality than (Ban-
nard et al, 2005) while the paraphrasing ratio is
lower than (Bannard et al, 2005).
5.2 Power of Generalization by Paraphrases
Finally, we investigated how many the ex-
tracted bilingual dependency patterns are general-
ized. Among 66,664 bilingual dependency patterns,
20,968 patterns were generalized into 12,631 unique
generalized patterns by applying the extracted para-
phrases2. As a result, the 66,664 bilingual depen-
dency patterns were compressed into 58,324 gener-
alized patterns with 12.5% compression ratio.
Furthermore, we examined how many bilingual
dependency patterns can be generated by the gener-
alized patterns in reverse. When replacing the gen-
eralized phrases with all of their paraphrases in both
English and Korean sides, 235,640 bilingual transla-
tion patterns are generated. These are 3.53 times of
the amount of the original translation patterns.
Even we have some errors in the paraphrase
2A paraphrase set is composed of more than two paraphrases
sets, these results might contribute to increasing the
coverage of the translation knowledge for machine
translation.
6 Related Work and Discussion
The proposed paraphrasing method can be an exten-
sion of the work done by (Bannard et al, 2005).
They introduced the method for extracting para-
phrases: Using the automatic alignment method
from phrase-based SMT, they showed that para-
phrases in one language can be identified using a
phrase in another language as a pivot. Furthermore,
they defined a paraphrase probability to rank the ex-
tracted paraphrases and suggested a method to refine
it by taking contextual information into account i.e.
including simple language model.
Our study for paraphrasing is similar to their work
but we take the bilingual dependency context into
account for disambiguating the sense of a phrase.
Limiting the candidate paraphrases to be the same
sense as the original phrase is critical to the per-
formance of paraphrases. Our approach provides
the solution to clearly disambiguate the sense of a
phrase using bilingual context information. This is
the strong point of our approach different from the
previous approaches.
Furthermore, in this work, we presented a method
to acquire somewhat generalized machine transla-
tion knowledge of bilingual dependency patterns.
There are few research of the acquisition of trans-
lation knowledge such like verb sub-categorization
patterns (Fung et al, 2004). (Fung et al, 2004)
tried to construct a bilingual semantic network,
BiFrameNet to enhance statistical and transfer-
332
based machine translation systems. They induced
the mapping between the English lexical entries in
FrameNet to Chinese word senses in HowNet. It
takes such an advantage of generalized bilingual
frame semantics. But, they have problems of appro-
priate mapping from lexical entries to word senses
and obtaining correct example sentences.
In our approach to acquire the generalized bilin-
gual translation patterns, a bilingual dependency
pattern is one of the decomposed bilingual verb sub-
categorization patterns. It is possible to construct
more complicated bilingual verb sub-categorization
pattern by applying a kind of unification operation.
In that case, we have the advantage of automati-
cally disambiguating the word/phrase senses via the
alignment techniques contrary to (Fung et al, 2004).
7 Conclusion
In this paper,we proposed a method to extract para-
phrases using bilingual corpora, which utilizes the
bilingual dependency relations obtained by project-
ing a monolingual dependency parse onto the other
language sentence based on statistical alignment
techniques. The advantage of our paraphrasing
method is that it can produce paraphrases of high
quality by clearly disambiguating the sense of an
original phrase.
Furthermore, we suggested an advanced method
to acquire generalized translation knowledge using
the extracted paraphrases. With the bilingual depen-
dency patterns generalized by the paraphrases, we
aim at reducing the translation ambiguity, but also
increasing the coverage of the translation knowl-
edge. The experimental results showed that our gen-
eralization method is effective to achieve the goals.
In future, we will utilize the paraphrases based
on bilingual dependency relations for increasing the
amount of bilingual corpus and for smoothing the
phrase probability table in statistical machine trans-
lation. Moreover, we plan to apply the acquired
translation patterns, which are generalized by para-
phrases, to various machine translation systems.

Abstract 
This paper addresses a new method of 
constructing Korean-Chinese verb 
patterns from existing patterns. A verb 
pattern is a subcategorization frame of 
a predicate extended by translation 
information. Korean-Chinese verb 
patterns are invaluable linguistic 
resources that  
	 only used for 
Korean-Chinese transfer but also for 
Korean parsing. Usually a verb pattern 
has been either hand-coded by expert 
lexicographers or extracted auto-
matically from bilingual corpus. In the 
first case, the dependence on the 
linguistic intuition of lexicographers 
may lead to the incompleteness and the 
inconsistency of a dictionary. In the 
second case, extracted patterns can be 
domain-dependent. In this paper, we 
present a method to construct Korean-
Chinese verb patterns semi-
automatically from existing Korean-
Chinese verb patterns that are manually 
written by lexicographers. 
1 Introduction 
PBMT (Pattern-based Machine Translation) 
approach has been adopted by many MT 
researchers, mainly due to the portability, 
customizability and the scalability of the 
approach. cf. Hong et al (2003a), Takeda (1996), 
Watanabe & Takeda (1998). However, major 
drawback of the approach is that it is often very 
costly and time-consuming to construct a large 
amount of data enough to assure the 
performance of the PBMT system. From this 
reason many studies from PBMT research 
circles have been focused on the data acquisition 
issue. Most of the data acquisition studies were 
about automatic acquisition of lexical resources 
from bilingual corpus.    
 Since 2001, ETRI has developed a Korean-
Chinese MT system, TELLUS K-C, under the 
auspices of the MIC (Ministry of Information 
and Communication) of Korean government. 
We have adopted verb pattern based approach 
for Korean-Chinese MT. The verb patterns play 
the most crucial role not only in the transfer but 
also in the source language analysis. In the 
beginning phase of the development, most of the 
verb patterns were constructed manually by 
experienced Korean-Chinese lexicographers 
with some help of editing tools and electronic 
dictionaries. In the setup stage of a system, the 
electronic dictionary is very useful for building a 
verb pattern DB. It provides with a 
comprehensive list of entries along with some 
basic examples to be added to the DB. In most 
cases, however, the examples in the dictionary 
with which the lexicographers write a verb 
pattern are basic usages of the verb in question, 
and other various usages of the verb are often 
neglected. Bilingual corpus can be useful 
resources to extract verb patterns. However, as 
for language pairs like Korean-Chinese for 
which there are not so much bilingual corpus 
available in electronic form, the approach does 
not seem to be suitable. Another serious 
problem with the bilingual corpus-based 
approach is that the patterns extracted from the 
corpus can be domain-dependent.  
The verb pattern generation based on 
translation equivalency is another good 
alternative to data acquisition from bilingual 
corpus. The idea was originally introduced by 
Fujita & Bond (2002) for Japanese to English 
MT.  
In this paper, we present a method to 
construct Korean-Chinese verb patterns from 
existing Korean-Chinese verb patterns that are 
manually written by lexicographers. The clue for 
the semi-automatic generation is provided by the 
idea that verbs of similar meanings often share 
the argument structure as already shown in 
Levin (1993). The synonymy among Korean 
verbs can be indirectly inferred from the fact 
that they have the same Chinese translation.  
We have already applied the approach to 
TELLUS K-C and increased the number of verb 
patterns from about 110,000 to 350,000. Though 
350,000 patterns still contain many erroneous 
patterns, the evaluations in section 5 will show 
that the accuracy of the semi-automatically 
generated patterns is noteworthy and the pattern 
matching ratio improves significantly with 
350,000 pattern DB.

When constructing verb pattern dictionary, too 
much dependence on the linguistic intuition of 
lexicographers can lead to the inconsistency and 
the incompleteness of the pattern dictionary. 
Similar problems are encountered when working 
with a paper dictionary due to the insufficient 
examples. Hong et al(2002) introduced the 
concept of causative/passive linking to Korean 
word dictionary. The active form ?mekta (to 
eat)? is linked to its causative/passive forms 
?mekita (to let eat)?, and ?mekhita (to be eaten)?, 
respectively. The linking information of this sort 
helps lexicographers not to forget to construct 
verb patterns for causative/passive verbs when 
they write a verb pattern for active verbs. The 
semi-automatic generation of verb patterns using 
translation equivalency was tried in Hong et al
(2002). However, as only the voice information 
was used as a filter, the over-generation problem 
is serious.  
Fujita & Bond (2002) and Bond & Fujita 
(2003) introduced the new method of 
constructing a new valency entry from existing 
entries for Japanese-English MT. Their method 
creates valency patterns for words in the word 
dictionary whose English translations can be 
found in the valency dictionary. The created 
valency patterns are paraphrased using 
monolingual corpus. The human translators 
check the grammaticality of the paraphrases.   
Yang et al (2002) used passive/causative 
alternation relation for semi-automatic verb 
pattern generation. Similar works have been 
done for Japanese by Baldwin & Tanaka (2000) 
and Baldwin & Bond (2002) .  
3 Verb Pattern in TELLUS K-C  
The term ?verb pattern? is understood as a kind 
of subcategorization frame of a predicate. 
However, a verb pattern in our approach is 
slightly different from a subcategorization frame 
in the traditional linguistics. The main difference 
between the verb pattern and the subcategoriza-
tion frame is that a verb pattern is always linked 
to the target language word (the predicate of the 
target language). Therefore, a verb pattern is 
employed not only in the analysis but also in the 
transfer phase so that the accurate analysis can 
directly lead to the natural and correct genera-
tion. In the theoretical linguistics, a subcatego-
rization frame always contains arguments of a 
predicate. An adjunct of a predicate or a 
modifier of an argument is usually not included 
in it. However, in some cases, these words must 
be taken into account for the proper translation. 
In translations adjuncts of a verb or modifiers of 
an argument can seriously affect the selection of 
target words. (1) exemplifies verb patterns of 
?cata (to sleep)?: 
 
(1) 
cata1 : A=WEATHER!ka ca!ta1 > A :v 
[param(A)ka cata: The wind has died down]

 The slot for nominal arguments is separated by a symbol 
?!? from case markers like ?ka?, ?lul?, ?eykey?, and etc. 
The verb is also separated by the symbol into the root and 
the ending. 
cata2 : A=HUMAN!ka ca!ta > A :v 
[ai(A)ka cata: A baby is sleeping] 
cata 3 : A=WATCH! ka ca!ta > A :v 
[sikye(A)ka cata: A watch has run down] 
cata 4 : A=PHENOMENA!ka ca!ta > A :v 
[phokpwungwu(A)ka cata: The storm has 
abated] 
 
On the left hand of ?>? Korean subcate-
gorization frame is represented. The argument 
position is filled with a variable (A, B, or C) 
equated with a semantic feature (WEATHER, 
HUMAN, WATCH, PHENOMENA). Currently 
we employ about 410 semantic features for 
nominal semantic classifications. The Korean 
parts of verb patterns are employed for syntactic 
parsing. 
On the right hand of ?>? Chinese translation 
is given with a marker ?:v?. To every pattern is 
attached an example sentence for better 
comprehensibility of the pattern. This part 
serves for the transfer and the generation of 
Chinese sentence.  
4 Pattern Construction based on 
Chinese Translation 
In this chapter, we elaborate on the method of 
semi-automatic construction of Korean-Chinese 
verb patterns. Our method is similar to that of 
Fujita & Bond (2002) and inspired by it as well, 
i.e. it makes most use of the existing resources. 
The existing resources are in this case verb 
patterns that have already been built manually. 
As every Korean verb pattern is provided with 
the corresponding Chinese translation, Korean 
verb patterns can be re-sorted to Chinese 
translations. The basic assumption of this 
approach is that the verbs with similar meanings 
tend to have similar case frames, as is pointed 
out in Levin (1993). As an indication to the 
similarity of meaning among Korean verbs, 
Chinese translation can be employed. If two 
verbs share Chinese translation, they are likely 
to have similar meanings. The patterns that have 
translation equivalents are seed patterns for 
automatic pattern generation.  
Our semi-automatic verb pattern generation 
method consists of the following four steps: 
 
Step1: Re-sort the existing Korean-Chinese verb 
patterns according to Chinese verbs 
 
Example: 
  
Chinese Verb 1:  (to give) 
 
tulita A=HUMAN!ka B=CAR!lul tuli!ta 
cwuta A=HUMAN!ka 
B=HUMAN!eykey 
C=VEGETABLE!lul cwu!ta 
swuyehata A=HUMAN!ka B=MONEY!lul 
swuyeha!ta 
 
 
Chinese Verb 2:   (to stop) 
 
kumantwuta A=HUMAN!ka 
B=CONSTRUCTION!lul 
kumantwu!ta 
kwantwuta A=ORGANIZATION!ka 
B=VIOLATION!lul 
kumantwu!ta 
 
When the re-sorting is done, we have sets of 
synonymous Korean verbs which share Chinese 
translations, such as {tulita, cwuta, swuyehata} 
and {kumantwuta, kwantwuta }.  
 
Step2: Pair verbs with the same Chinese 
translation 
 
Example: 
 
Chinese Verb 1:  (to give) 
 
Pair1: 
tulita A=HUMAN!ka B=CAR!lul tuli!ta 
cwuta A=HUMAN!ka 
B=HUMAN!eykey 
C=VEGETABLE!lul cwu!ta 
 
Pair2: 
tulita A=HUMAN!ka B=CAR!lul tuli!ta 
swuyehata A=HUMAN!ka B=MONEY!lul 
swuyeha!ta 
 
 
Pair3: 
cwuta A=HUMAN!ka 
B=HUMAN!eykey 
C=VEGETABLE!lul cwu!ta 
swuyehata A=HUMAN!ka B=MONEY!lul 
swuyeha!ta 
 
 
Step3: Exchange the verbs, if the following 
three conditions are met: 
 
- The two Korean verbs of the pair have 
the same voice information 
- Neither of the two verbs is idiomatic 
expressions 
- The Chinese translation is not 
 
 
Example: 
 
tulita A=HUMAN!ka B=HUMAN!eykey 
C=VEGETABLE!lul tuli!ta 
tulita A=HUMAN!ka B=MONEY!lul 
tuli!ta 
cwuta A=HUMAN!ka B=CAR!lul cwu!ta 
cwuta A=HUMAN!ka B=MONEY!lul 
cwu!ta 
swuyehata A=HUMAN!ka B=CAR!lul 
swuyeha!ta 
swuyehata A=HUMAN!ka B=HUMAN!eykey 
C=VEGETABLE!lul swuyeha!ta 
 
 
Step4: If the newly-generated pattern already 
exists in the verb pattern dictionary, it is 
discarded. 
 
The three conditions to be met in the third 
step are the filters to prevent the over-generation 
of patterns. The following examples shows why 
the first condition, i.e., ?the voice of the verbs in 
question must agree?, must be met.
