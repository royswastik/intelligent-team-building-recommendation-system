Abstract
Most corpus-based approaches to
natural language processing suer
from lack of training data. This
is because acquiring a large num-
ber of labeled data is expensive.
This paper describes a learning
method that exploits unlabeled data
to tackle data sparseness problem.
The method uses committee learn-
ing to predict the labels of unla-
beled data that augment the exist-
ing training data. Our experiments
on word sense disambiguation show
that predictive accuracy is signi-
cantly improved by using additional
unlabeled data.
1 Introduction
The objective of word sense disambiguation
(WSD) is to identify the correct sense of a
word in context. It is one of the most critical
tasks in most natural language applications,
including information retrieval, information
extraction, and machine translation. The
availability of large-scale corpus and various
machine learning algorithms enabled corpus-
based approach to WSD (Cho and Kim, 1995;
Hwee and Lee, 1996; Wilks and Stevenson,
1998),but a large scale sense-tagged corpus
or aligned bilingual corpus is needed for a
corpus-based approach.
However, most languages except English
do not have a large-scale sense-tagged cor-
pus. Therefore, any corpus-based approach
to WSD for such languages should consider
the following problems:
 There's no reliable and available sense-
tagged corpus.
 Most words are sense ambiguous.
 Annotating the large corpora requires
human experts, so that it is too expen-
sive.
Because it is expensive to construct sense-
tagged corpus or bilingual corpus, many re-
searchers tried to reduce the number of ex-
amples needed to learn WSD (Atsushi et al,
1998; Pedersen and Bruce, 1997). Atsushi et
al. (Atsushi et al, 1998) adopted a selec-
tive sampling method to use small number of
examples in training. They dened a train-
ing utility function to select examples with
minimum certainty, and at each training it-
eration the examples with less certainty were
saved in the example database. However, at
each iteration of training the similarity among
word property vectors must be calculated due
to their k-NN like implementation of training
utility.
While labeled examples obtained from a
sense-tagged corpus is expensive and time-
consuming, it is signicantly easier to ob-
tain the unlabeled examples. Yarowsky
(Yarowsky, 1995) presented, for the rst time,
the possibility that unlabeled examples can
be used for WSD. He used a learning algo-
rithm based on the local context under the
assumption that all instances of a word have
the same intended meaning within any xed
document and achieved good results with only
a few labeled examples and many unlabeled
ones. Nigam et al (Nigam et al, 2000) also
showed the unlabeled examples can enhance
the accuracy of text categorization.

Table 1: The properties used to distinguish the sense of an ambiguous Korean noun w.
In this paper, we present a new approach
to word sense disambiguation that is based
on selective sampling algorithm with commit-
tees. In this approach, the number of train-
ing examples is reduced, by determining by
weighted majority voting of multiple classi-
ers, whether a given training example should
be learned or not. The classiers of the com-
mittee are rst trained on a small set of la-
beled examples and the training set is aug-
mented by a large number of unlabeled exam-
ples. One might think that this has the pos-
sibility that the committee is misled by unla-
beled examples. But, the experimental results
conrm that the accuracy of WSD is increased
by using unlabeled examples when the mem-
bers of the committee are well trained with
labeled examples. We also theoretically show
that performance improvement is guaranteed
by a mild requirement, i.e., the base classi-
ers need to guess better than random selec-
tion. This is because the possibility misled by
unlabeled examples is reduced by integrating
outputs of multiple classiers. One advantage
of this method is that it eectively performs
WSD with only a small number of labeled ex-
amples and thus shows possibility of building
word sense disambiguators for the languages
which have no sense-tagged corpus.
The rest of this paper is organized as fol-
lows. Section 2 introduces the general proce-
dure for word sense disambiguation and the
necessity of unlabeled examples. Section 3 ex-
plains how the proposed method works using
both labeled and unlabeled examples. Section
4 presents the experimental results obtained
by using the KAIST raw corpus. Section 5
draws conclusions.

resenting selected contextual features. If we

2.1 Property Sets
In general, the rst step of WSD is to extract
a set of contextual features. To select particu-
lar properties for Korean, the language of our
cencern, the following characteristics should
be considered:
 Korean is a partially free-order language.
The ordering information on the neigh-
bors of the ambiguous word, therefore,
does not give signicantly meaningful in-
formation in Korean.
 In Korean, ellipses appear very often
with a nominative case or objective case.
Therefore, it is di?cult to build a large
scale database of labeled examples with
case markers.
Considering both characteristics and re-
sults of previous work, we select eight prop-
erties for WSD of Korean nouns (Table 1).
Three of them (PARENT, NMODWORD,
ADNWORD) take morphological form as
their value, one (GFUNC) takes 11 values of
grammatical functions
1
, and others take only
true or false.
2.2 Unlabeled Data for WSD
Many researchers tried to develop automated
methods to reduce training cost in language
learning and found out that the cost can be
reduced by active learning which has control
over the training examples (Dagan and Engel-
son, 1997; Liere and Tadepalli, 1997; Zhang,
1994). Though the number of labeled exam-
ples needed is reduced by active learning, the
label of the selected examples must be given
by the human experts. Thus, active learn-
ing is still expensive and a method for auto-
matic labeling unlabeled examples is needed
to have the learner automatically gather in-
formation (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Peder-
sen and Bruce, 1997; Yarowsky, 1995).
As the unlabeled examples can be obtained
with ease without human experts it makes
WSD robust. Yarowsky (Yarowsky, 1995)
presented the possibility of automatic label-
ing of training examples in WSD and achieved
good results with only a few labeled exam-
ples and many unlabeled examples. On the
other hand, Blum and Mitchell tried to clas-
sify Web pages, in which the description of
each example can be partitioned into distinct
views such as the words occurring on that
page and the words occurring in hyperlinks
(Blum and Mitchell, 1998). By using both
views together, they augmented a small set
of labeled examples with a lot of unlabeled
examples.
The unlabeled examples in WSD can pro-
vide information about the joint probability

versity, Korea.
distribution over properties but they also can
mislead the learner. However, the possibility
of being misled by the unlabeled examples is
reduced by the committee of classiers since
combining or integrating the outputs of sev-
eral classiers in general leads to improved
performance. This is why we use active learn-
ing with committees to select informative un-
labeled examples and label them.
3 Active Learning with
Committees for WSD
3.1 Active Learning Using Unlabeled
Examples
The algorithm for active learning using unla-
beled data is given in Figure 1. It takes two
sets of examples as inputs. A Set L is the one
with labeled examples and D = fx
1
; : : : ;x
T
g
is the one with unlabeled examples where x
i
is a property vector. First of all, the training
set L
(1)
j
(1  j  M) of labeled examples is
constructed for each base classier C
j
. This
is done by random resampling as in Bagging
(Breiman, 1996). Then, each base classier
C
j
is trained with the set of labeled examples
L
(1)
j
.
After the classiers are trained on labeled
examples, the training set is augmented by
the unlabeled examples. For each unlabeled
example x
t
2 D, each classier computes the
sense y
j
2 S which is the label associated with
it, where S is the set of possible sense of x
t
.
The distribution W over the base classi-
ers represents the importance weights. As
the distribution can be changed each iter-
ation, the distribution in iteration t is de-
noted by W
t
. The importance weight of clas-
sier C
j
under distribution W
t
is denoted by
W
t
(j). Initially, the base classiers have equal
weights, so that W
t
(j) = 1=M .

Abstract 
Long sentence analysis has been a critical 
problem because of high complexity. This pa- 
per addresses the reduction of parsing com- 
plexity by intra-sentence segmentation, and 
presents max imum entropy model for deter- 
mining segmentation positions. The model 
features lexical contexts of segmentation posi- 
tions, giving a probability to each potential 
position. Segmentation coverage and accu- 
racy of the proposed method are 96% and 
88% respectively. The parsing efficiency is im- 
proved by 77% in time and 71% in space. 
1 Introduction 
Long sentence analysis has been a critical 
problem in machine translation because of 
high complexity. In EBMT (example-based 
machine translation), the longer a sentence 
is, the less possible it is that the sentence 
has an exact match in the translation archive, 
and the less flexible an EBMT system will be 
(Cranias et al, 1994). In idiom-based ma- 
chine translation (Lee, 1993), long sentence 
parsing is difficult because more resources are 
spent during idiom recognition phase as sen- 
tence length increases. A parser is often un- 
able to analyze long sentences owing to their 
complexity, though they have no grammatical 
errors (Nasukawa, 1995). 
In English-Korean machine translation, 
idiom-based approach is adopted to overcome 
the structural differences between two lan- 
guages and to get more accurate translation. 
The parser is a chart parser with a capabil- 
ity of idiom recognition and translation, which 
is adapted to English-Korean machine trana- 
lation. Idioms are recognized prior to syn- 
tactic analysis and the part of a sentence for 
an idiom takes an edge in a chart (Winograd, 
1983). When parsing long sentences, an am- 
biguity of an idiom's range may cause more 
edges than the number of words included in 
the idiom (Yoon, 1994), which increases pars- 
ing complexity much. A parser of practical 
machine translation system should be able to 
analyze long sentences in a reasonable time. 
Most context-free parsing algorithms have 
O(n 3) parsing complexities in terms of time 
and space, where n is the length of a sen- 
tence (Tomita, 1986). Our work is moti- 
vated by the fact that parsing becomes more 
efficient, if n becomes horter. This paper 
deals with the problem of parsing complex- 
ity by way of reducing the length of sentence 
to be analyzed. This reduction is achieved 
by in t ra -sentence  segmentat ion,  which is 
distinguished from inter--sentence s gmen-  
tat ion that is used for text categorization 
(Beeferman et al, 1997) or sentence boundary 
identification (Palmer and Hearst, 1997) (Rey- 
nar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997). Intra-sentence 
segmentation plays a role as a preliminary 
step to a chart-based, context-free parser in 
English-Korean machine translation. 
There have been several methods for 
reducing parsing complexities by intra- 
sentence segmentation. In (Lyon and Frank, 
1995)(Lyon and Dickerson, 1997), they took 
advantage of the fact that the declarative 
sentences almost always consist of three seg- 
ments: \[pre-subject : subject:predicate\] .  
The complexity could be reduced by decom- 
posing a sentence into three sections. Pattern 
rules (Li et al, 1990) and sentence patterns 
(Kim and Khn, 1995) were used to segment 
long English sentences. They showed low seg- 
mentation coverage, which means that many 
of long sentences are not segmented by the 
pattern rules or sentence patterns. And they 
require much human efforts to construct pat- 
tern rules or collect sentence patterns. These 
factors may prevent hem being applicable to 
practical machine translation sYstems. 
This paper presents a trainable model for 
identifying potential segmentation positions 
164 
in a sentence and determining appropriate 
segmentation positions. Given a corpus anno- 
tated with segmentation positions, our model 
automatically earns the contextual evidences 
about segmentation positions, which relieves 
human of burden to construct pattern rules or 
sentence patterns. These evidences are com- 
bined under the maximum entropy framework 
(Jaynes, 1957) to estimate the probability for 
each position. By intra-sentence s gmenta- 
tion based on the proposed model, we achieve 
more improved parsing efficiency by 77% in 
time and 71% in space. 
In Section 2 we introduce the maximum en- 
tropy model. Section 3 describes features in- 
corporated into the model and the process of 
identifying potential segmentation positions. 
The determination schemes of segmentation 
positions are described in Section 4. Segmen- 
tation performance of the model is presented 
with the degree of contribution to efficient 
parsing by the segmentation in Section 5. We 
also compare our approach with other intra- 
sentence segmentation approaches. Section 6 
draws conclusions and presents ome further 
works. 
2 Max imum Ent ropy  Mode l ing  
Sentence patterns or pattern ruels specify the 
sub-structures of the sentences. That is, seg- 
mentation positions are determined in view of 
the global sentence structure. If there is no 
matched rules or patterns with a given sen- 
tence, the sentence could not be segmented. 
We assume that whether aword is a segmenta- 
tion position depends on its surrounding con- 
text. We try to find factors that affect the de- 
termination of segmentation positions. Maxi- 
mum entropy is a technique for automatically 
acquiring knowledge from incomplete infor- 
mation, without making any unsubstantiated 
assumptions. It masters ubtle effects o that 
we may accurately model subtle dependencies. 
It does not make any unwarranted assump- 
tions, which means that maximum entropy 
learns exactly what the data says. Therefore 
it can perform well on unseen data. 
The idea is to construct a model that as- 
signs a probability to each potential segmen- 
tation position in a sentence. We build a prob- 
ability distribution p(ylx), where y ? {0, 1} 
is a random variable specifying the potential 
segmentation position in a context x. A fea- 
tu re  of a context is a binary-valued indicator 
function \] expressing the information about a 
specific context. 
Given a training sample of size N, 
(Xl,Yl),..-, (XN,YN), an empir ica l  proba-  
bi l i ty d i s t r ibut ion  can be defined as 
y) = y) 
N 
where #(x,  y) is the number of occurrences of
(x, y). The expected value of feature fi with 
respect o the empirical distribution i~(x, y) is 
expressed as 
x,y 
and the expected value of fi with respect o 
the probability distribution p(ylx) is 
p(.fi) -~ ~(x)pCylx) .h(x ,  y), 
x~y 
where l~(x) is the empirical distribution of x 
in the corpus. We want to build probability 
distribution p(ylx) that is required to accord 
to the feature fi useful in selecting segmenta- 
tion positions: P(fi) = IS(fi) for all fi ? .T, 
where Y is the set of candidate features. This 
makes the probability distribution be built on 
only training data. 
Given a feature set .T, let C be the subset 
of all distributions P that satisfies the require- 
ment P(fi) = P(fi): 
C ~- {p ? ~ \] P(fi) = P(fi), for all fi ? .T}. 
(1) 
We choose a probability distribution consis- 
tent with all the facts, but otherwise as uni- 
form as possible. The uniformity of the prob- 
ability distribution p(ylx) is measured by the 
conditional entropy: 
H(p) = - ~p(x ,  y) logp(ylx) 
x~y 
=   (x)PCulx) logp(ylx) 
x,y 
Thus, the probability distribution with maxi- 
mum entropy is the most uniform distribution. 
In building a model, we consider the linear 
exponential family Q given as 
1 
Q(f) = {p(ylx)= ~exp(  E ~ifi(x,y))}, 
$ 
(2) 
165 
where Ai are real-valued parameters and 
ZA(x) is a normalizing constant: 
= exp(  y)). 
y i 
An intersection of the class Q of exponential 
models with the class of desired distribution 
(1) is nonempty, and the intersection contains 
the maximum entropy distribution and fur- 
thermore it is unique (Ratnaparkhi, 1994). 
Finding p. E C that maximizes H(p) is a 
problem in constrained optimization, which 
cannot be explicitly written in general. There- 
fore, we take advantage of the fact that the 
models in Q that satisfy p(fi) = 15(fi) can 
be explained under the maximum likelihood 
framework (Ratnaparkhi, 1994). Maximum 
likelihood principle also gives the unique dis- 
tribution p., the intersection of the class Q 
with C. 
We assume each occurrence of (x,y) is 
sampled independently. Thus, log-likelihood 
L#(p) of the empirical distribution i5 as pre- 
dicted by a model p can be defined as 
L~)  _= log I I  p(ylx) ~(~'y) = ~\]p(x,  y) logp(ylx ).

The parameters A~ of exponential model (2) 
are obtained by the Generalized Iterative Scal- 
ing algorithm (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972). 
3 Const ruct ion  o f  Features  
This section describes the features. From a 
corpus, contextual evidences of segmentation 
positions are collected and combined, result- 
ing in features. The features are used in iden- 
tifying potential segmentation positions and 
included in the model. 
3.1 Segmentab le  Posit ions and  Safe 
Segmentation 
A sentence is constructed by the combina- 
tion of words, phrases, and clauses under the 
well-defined grammar. A sentence can be seg- 
mented into shorter segments that correspond 
to the constituents of the sentence. That is, 
segments correspond to the nonterminal sym- 
bols of the context-free grammar 1. The posi- 
1Nonterminal symbols include the ones for phrases, 
such as NP  (noun phrase) and VP  (verb phrase), 
tion of a word is called segmentab le  posi- 
t ion that can be a starting position of a spe- 
cific segment. 
Though the analysis complexity can be re- 
duced by segmenting a sentence, there is 
a mis-segmentation risk that causes pars- 
ing failures. A segmentation can be called 
safe segmentat ion  that results in a coherent 
blocks of words. In English-Korean transla- 
tion, safe segmentation is defined as the one 
which generates safe segments. A segment is 
safe, when there is a syntactic ategory sym- 
bol N P dominating the segment and the seg- 
ment can be combined with adjacent segments 
under a given grammar. In Figure 1, (a) is an 
unsafe segmentation because the second seg- 
ment cannot be analyzed into one syntactic 
category, resulting in parsing failure. By the 
safe segmentation (b), the first segment cor- 
responds to a noun phrase and the second to 
a verb phrase, so that we can get a correct 
analysis result.

3.2 Lexical Contextua l  Const ra in ts  
A lexical context  of a word includes even- 
word window: three to the left of a word and 
three to the right of a word and a word itself. 
It also includes the part-of-speeches of these 
words, subcategorization information for two 
words to the left, and position value. The 
position value posi_v of the ith word wi is cal- 
culated as 
pos _v = r ? R\ ] ,  
where n is the number of words and R 2 repre- 
sents the number of regions in the sentence. 
Region is the sequentially ordered block of 
and the ones for clauses like RLCL (relative clause), 
SUBCL (subordinate clause). 
sit is a heuristically set value, and we set R as 4. 
166 
words in a sentence, and posi_v represents he 
region in which a word lies. It is included to 
reflect the influence of the position of a word 
on being a segmentation position. Thus, the 
lexical context of a word is represented by 17 
attributes as shown in Figure 2.

An example of a training data and a re-

A symbol '# '  represents a segmentation posi- 
tion marked by human annotators. Therefore, 
the lexical context of word when includes the 
value 1 for attribute s_position? and follow- 
ings: three words to the left of when (became, 
terribly, and worried) and part-of-speeches 
o f  each word (VERB ADV ADJ), three words 
to the right (they, saw, and what) and part- 
of-speeches (PRON VERB PRON), subcat- 
egorization information for two words to the 
left (0 1), and position value (2).

a lexical context. 
To get reliable statistics, much training 
data is required. To alleviate this prob- 
lem, we generate lexical contextua l  con- 
st ra lnts  by combining lexical contexts and 
collect statistics for them. To generate lex- 
ical contextual constraints and to identify 
segmentable positions, we define two oper- 
ations join (E9) and consistency (=). Let 
(a l , . . . ,an)  and (bl , . . . ,bn) be lexical con- 
texts and (C1,... ,On) be lexical contextual 
constraint. The operation join is defined as 
(a l , . . . ,  an) ? (bl, .- . ,  bn) = (C1,... ,  Ca), 
,.i if ai # bi 
Ci = ai if ai = bi ' 
where ' , '  is don't-care term accepting any 
value. A lexical contextual constraint is gen- 
erated as a result of jo in operation. The 
consistency is defined as 
1 if (C i=a iorC i= '* r )  fo ra l l l< i<n 
k = 0 otherwise

Identifying segmentable positions is per- 
formed with the consistency operation with 
the lexical context of word w and lcc E LCCw. 
The word whose lexical context is consistent 
with lcc is identified as a segmentable posi- 
tion. 
4 Determinat ion  Schemes  of  
Segmentat ion  Pos i t ions  
Segmentation positions are determined 
through two steps: identifying segmentable 
positions and selecting the most appropriate 
position among them. Segmentable positions 
are identified using the consistency operation. 
Maximum entropy model in Section 2 gives a 
probability to each position. 
Segmentation performance is measured in 
terms of coverage and accuracy. Coverage is 
the ratio of the number of actually segmented 
sentences to the number of segmentation tar- 
get sentences that are longer than ot words, 
where o~ is a fixed constant distinguishing long 
sentences from short ones. Accuracy is evalu- 
ated in terms of the safe segmentation ratio. 
They are defined as follows: 
# of actually segmented Sent. 
coverage = ~ of Sent. to be segmented 
(3) 
# of Sent. with safe segmentation 
accuracy = ~ of actually segmented Sent. 
(a) 
4.1 Basel ine Scheme 
No contextual information is used in identify- 
ing segmentable positions. They are empiri- 
cally identified. A word that is tagged as a 
segmentation position more than 5 times is 
identified as a segmentable position. A set of 
segmentable positions, 9 ,  is as follows. 
~D = {wi \[ wi is tagged as segmentation position 
and #(tagged wi) >_ 5} 
In order to select the most appropriate po- 
sition, the segmentation appropriateness of
each position is evaluated by the probability 
of word wi: 
# of tagged wi 
p(Wi) = # of wi in the corpus 
p(wi) represents the tendency that word wi 
will be used as a segmentation position. A 
segmentation position w. is selected as the one 
that has highest p(wi) value: 
w. = arg max p(wi). wiE~ 
This scheme serves as a baseline for comparing 
the segmentation performance of the models. 
4.2 A Scheme using Lexical 
Contextua l  Const ra ints  
Lexical contextual constraints are used in 
identifying segmentable positions. Compared 
with the baseline scheme, this scheme con- 
siders contextual information of a word. All 
consistent words with the defined lexical con- 
textual constraints form a set of segmentable 
positions 79. 
The maximum likelihood principle gives a 
probability distribution for p(y I lcc~), where 
y E {0, 1}. Segmentation appropriateness is 
evaluated by p(1 I lcew,). A position with the 
highest p(1 I lcc~) becomes a segmentation 
position: 
w. = arg max p(1 I/CCwi).

4.3 A Scheme using Lexical 
Contextua l  Const ra ints  w i th  
Word Sets 
Due to insufficient raining samples for con- 
structing lexical contextual constraints, ome 
segmentable positions may not be identified. 
To alleviate this problem we introduce word 
sets whose elements have linguistically similar 
features. We define four word sets: coordinate 
conjunction set, subordinate conjunction set, 
interogative set, auxiliary verb set. The cate- 
gories of word sets and the examples of their 
members are shown in Table 1. 
Table 1: The word sets and examples. 
Word Set Examples 
Coordinate Conjunctions and, or, but 
Subordinate Conjunctions if, when, . . .  
Interogatives how, what, . . .  
Auxiliary Verbs can, should, . . .  
Coordinate conjunctions haveonly 3 mem- 
bers, but they frequently apprear in long sen- 
tences. Subordinate conjunctions have 25 
168 
members, interogatives 5 members, and aux- 
iliary verbs have 12 members now. The words 
belonging to each word set are treated equally. 
Lexical contextual constraints are constructed 
for words and word sets, so the statistics is 
collected for both of them. The set of seg- 
mentable positions T~ is defined somewhat dif- 
ferently as: 
:D = {wi, wsj I (Icc, v, -= lcc~,) = 1 
or (Icws~ =-- IcC.ws~) = 1}, 
where wsj denotes a word set to which the j th  
word in a sentence belongs. 
In this scheme, p(1 I Iccc,,,) or p(1 \] lccws,) 
expresses the segmentation appropriateness of 
the position. Therefore, a segmentation posi- 
tion is determined by 
w, = arg max {p(1 I lcc ,), p(1 I lcc s )}. {w,,ws~}~9 
5 Exper iments  
5.1 Corpus  and  Const ruct ion  of  the  
Max imum Ent ropy  Mode l  
We construct he corpus from two different 
domains, where the sentences longer than 15 
-words are extracted 3. The training portion is 
used to generate l xical contextual constraints 
and to collect statistics for maximum entropy 
model construction. From high school English 
texts, 1500 sentences are tagged with segmen- 
tation positions by human. Two people who 
have some knowledge about English syntactic 
structures read sentences, and marked words 
as segmentation positions where they paused. 
After generating lexical contextual con- 
straints, we constructed the maximum en- 
tropy model p(ylx), where x is a lexical con- 
textual constraint and y E {0,1}. The model 
incorporates features that occur more than 5 
times in the training data. 3626 candidate fea- 
tures were generated without word sets and 
3878 features with word sets. In Table 2, 
training time and the number of active fea- 
tures of the model are shown. 
Segmentation performance is evaluated us- 
ing test portion that consists of 1800 sentences 
ffrom two domains: high school English texts 
and the Byte Magazine. 
3The sentences with commas are excluded because 
comma is an explicit segmentation position. Segments 
resulting from a segmentation at commas may be the 
manageable-sized ones. Our work is to segment long 
sentences without explicit segmentation positions.

5.2 Segmentat ion  Per fo rmance  
In addition to coverage and accuracy, SC 
value is also defined to express the degree of 
contribution to efficient parsing by segmenta- 
tion. It is the ratio of the sentences that can 
benefit from intra-sentence s gmentation. If a 
long sentence isnot segmented or is segmented 
at unsafe segmentation positions, the sentence 
is called a segmentat ion  er ror  sentence .  
SC value is calculated as 
# of segmentation error sentences SG= I -  
# of segmentation target sentences" 
A sentence longer than vt words is con- 
sidered as the segmentation target sentence, 
where c~ is set to 12. Table 3 compares eg- 
mentation performance for each determina- 
tion scheme.

termination schemes of segmentation position.

By the comparison of the baseline scheme 
with others, the accuracy is observed to de- 
pend on the context information. Word sets 
are helpful for increasing coverage with less 
degradation of accuracy. Each scheme has su- 
periority in terms of the different measures. 
But in terms of applicability to practical sys- 
tems, the third scheme is best for our purpose. 
Table 4 shows the segmentation performance 
of the scheme using LCC with word sets. 
SU value for the sentences from the same 
domain as training data is about 0.88, and

about 0.85 for the sentenes from the Byte 
Magazine. Though they slightly differ be- 
tween test domains, about 87% of long sen- 
tences can be parsed with less complexity and 
without causing parsing failures. It suggests 
that the intra-sentence s gmentation method 
can be utilized for efficient parsing of the long 
sentences. 
5.3  Pars ing  E f f i c iency  
Parsing efficiency is generally measured by 
the required time and memory for parsing. 
In most cases, parsing sentences longer than 
30 words could not complete without intra- 
sentence segmentation. Therefore, the parsing 
is performed for the sentences longer than 15 
and less than 30 words. Ultra-Sparc 30 ma- 
chine is used for experiments. The efficiency 
improvement was measured by 
EItime tunseg -- tseg = ,,, x 100, 
tunseg 
EImemory = rnunseg --mseg X 100, 
~T~unse9 
where $unseg and rrbanseg are time and memory 
during parsing without segmentation a d tseg, 
rnseg are for the parsing with segmentation. 
Table 5 summarizes the results. 
By segmenting long sentences into several 
manageable-sized s gments, we can parse long 
sentences with much less time and space.

segmentation coverage and the improvement 
of parsing efficiency. 
In (Lyon and Frank, 1995)(Lyon and Dick- 
erson, 1997), a sentence is segmented into 
three segments. Though parsing efficiency can 
be improved by segmenting a sentence, this 
method may be applied to only simple sen- 
tences 4. Long sentences are generally coordi- 
nate sentences 5 or complex sentences 6. They 
have more than two subjects, so applying this 
method to such sentences seems to be inap- 
propriate. 
In (Kim and Kim, 1995), sentence patterns 
are used to segment long sentences. This 
method improve parsing efficiency by 30% in 
time and 58% in space. However collecting 
sentence patterns requires much hnman efforts 
and segmentation coverage isonly about 36%. 
Li's method (Li et al, 1990) for sentence 
segmentation also depends upon manual- 
intensive pattern rules. Segmentation cover- 
age seems to be unsatisfactory for practical 
machine translation system. 
The proposed method can be applied to co- 
ordinate and complex sentences a  well as sim- 
ple sentences. It shows segmentation coverage 
of about 96%. In addition, it needs no other  
human efforts except for constructing training 
data. Human ~.nnotators have only to read 
sentences and mark segmentation positions, 
which is more simple than collecting pattern 
rules or sentence patterns. We can also get 
much improved parsing efficiency: about 77% 
in time and about 71% in space. 
4A simple sentence has one subject and one predi- 
cate. 
5A coordinate sentence results ~om the combina- 
tion of several simple sentences by the coordinate con- 
junctions. - 
6A complex sentence consists of a main clause and 
several subordinate clauses.

6 Conc lus ion  and  Future  Work  
Practical machine translation systems hould 
be able to accommodate long sentences. Thus 
intra-sentence s gmentation is required as a 
means for reducing parsing complexity. This 
paper presents a method for intra-sentence 
segmentation based on the maximum entropy 
model. The method builds statistical models 
automatically from a text corpus to provide 
the segmentation appropriateness for safe seg- 
mentation. 
In the experiments with 1800 test sentences, 
about 87% of them were benefited from seg- 
mentation. The statistical intra-sentence seg- 
mentation method can also relieve human of 
the burden of constructing information, such 
as segmentation rules or sentence patterns. 
Experiments suggest that the proposed maxi- 
mum entropy models can be incorporated into 
the parser for practical machine translation 
systems. 
Further works can be done in two direc- 
tions. First, studies on recovery mecha- 
nisms for unsafe segmentation before parsing 
seem necessary since ungafe segmentation may 
cause parsing failures. Second, parsing control 
mechanisms should be studied that exploit he 
-characteristics of segmentation positions and 
the parallelism among segments. This will en- 
hance parsing efficiency further.
