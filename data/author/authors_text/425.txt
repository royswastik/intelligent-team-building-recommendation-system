We present an al)proach to the increnmntal ac- 
crual of lexical int'ornmtion fl)r unknown words t;hat

unification-liased granlnmrs. All;hough the tech- 
niques are language-ind(:l)en(lent a d can l)('. al)plied 
to all kinds of informal;ion, ill (;his 1)al)er we concen- 
(;rate on the domain of German noun intl('ction. We 
show how morl)hological intbrnm.tion, est)ecially in- 
flectional class, is successfully acquired using a tyl)e- 
based HPSG-like analysis. 15lrthernlore, we sketch 
an alternative strategy which nmkes use of finite.-

Systenls for nai;tn'al anguage l)roc('ssing nms(: deal 
adequately with "unlmown" words, i.e. lex(:mes (hat 
either have been newly coin(:(l or else have not been 
included in a 1)articular lexicon (of. Kilbury et al 
(1994)). l{ather l;han simply regarding mlknown 
words as noise, our syst;(:m insl;(;ad uses t:h(-ir con- 
text as a source tbr 1;11(: systematic accrual of lcxical

l;istical approaches like that of (Brent, 1!)!11), which 
often do not work increnmntally and are intended 
tbr tilt application to large corl)ora, ours instead 
aims at a detailed grammatical nalysis of individual 
sentences with a maximal use of their information. 
While systems like l;hat of (Hahn el, al., 1996) deal 
with the general acquisition of concepts, we are con- 
cerned exclusively with the acquisition of s(A'ucl;ural 
linguistic infornmtion. 
All, hough we deal here with German noun in- 
ttection, in a ti'amework close to that of (Riehe- 
mann, 1998) and (Koenig, 1999), the techniques are 
language-indel)endent a d al)ply to other ldnds of 
lexical inibrmation as well, as is shown in (Walther 
and Barg, 1998) with respect o valency intbnnation. 
Thus, in contrast to (Ehrlich and Rapaport, 1997), 
who employ tailored algorithms for the acquisition 
of intbnnation al)out nouns and verbs, we introduce 
an apl)roac.h thai; is COml/letely general with )'esl)ect 
to the kind of structural inguistic information ac- 
quire& 
2 German noun-inflection classes 
There is a w/st literature on German noun inflection 
represented in recent studies by (Cahill and Gazdar, 
1999), (Clahsen, 1999), and (Neef, 1998). Here we 
stmnnarize only essential points and ignore highly 
irregular and archaic inilections (cf. figure 4 below). 
Gernmn nouns l)ear gender (masculine, tbininine, 
neutt,r) and are inflected for number (singular, 1)lu- 
rail and case (nontilmt.ive, accusative, dat.ive, geni- 
(ire). \Vith the exeq)(;ion of class NWN (e.g. mast 
Ha.'uvr 'farnwr': wi(;h gen sg f~aucrn,), all nonfl:minine 
nouns build genitive singular with -s. 
The "regular" (of. ()lahsen (1999))but; "atytfi- 
cal" (cf. \\qlnderlich (1999)) nouns of class NA (e.g. 
Auto ~car') build their plural forms in -s. The l)lural 
forms of all o(;her (i.e. %yl)ical') (:lasses nmst end 
ill a so-called schwa syllable -c, -el, - c'r, or -en (i.e. 
l)honetically all unstressed \[o\] ta)llowed by a sonoranl, 
f~'olll \[1 , .\]). 
S(;l'()llg lIOllllS add -e for l)lural ill class NS (e.g. 
A'r'm, 'arm', pl A'rm, c) and class NU (e.g. d~'zt 'l)hysi- 
clan', pl /{rztc) if (;he sl;enl itself does not already 
end in a schwa syllable (e.g. Kabcl 'cable', pl Ka- 
bell. Class NU flwthermore umlauts the stem (i.e. 
replaces a, o, ,it,, au  with ii, 5, ii, iiu, respectively), as 
does (:lass NR (e.g. Mann 'man',  pl \]VIiinncr), which 
adds - er. 
The remaining (:lasses (NM, NWN, and NWS) 
t'onn their plural ill -n (e.g. Schraube  'screw', pl 
Sch, rauben). The nonnominative singular stenl in 
class NWN (e.g. lIasc 'hare', gen sg Hasen) and 
class NWS (e.g. Glaubc 'belief', gen sg Glaubcns) 
is identical with the phlral fornL while N\VN excel> 
(;iolmlly adds no -s in genitive singular. 
All (:lasses except NA build dative plural by 
adding -n (;o the phn'al Ibrm if it is not already 
present (e.g. Miinncr 'men', dat pl Miinncrn but 
Itascn 'hares', dat pl Hascn).

3 Representat ion  of  in f lec t iona l  
morpho logy  
Various proposals have been made for the represen- 
tation of inflectional morphology within constraint- 
based frameworks like HPSG (cf. Pollard (1994)). 
We neither adopt a word-syntax al)proach like that 
of (Krieger and Nerbonne, 1.993) assunfing lexical 
entries tbr inflectional affixes as well as roots, nor do 
we make use of lexical rules, as (Meurers and Min- 
nen, 1997) do. 
Instead, we follow (Riehemmm, 1.998) in formu- 
lating hierarchically structured schemata of the kind 
she has developed for derivational morphology l)ut 
apply them here to inflection and thus carry out a 
kind of inflectional analysis without lexical rules as 
projected by (Erjavec, 1996). Our schemata cap- 
ture inflectional paradigms and can be regarded as 
rela.tional constraints that relate stems, affixes, and 
inflected lexical forms. 
Figure 1 shows our hierarchy of inttectional 
schemata, wlfile figure 2 illustrates a concrete 
schema, namely that tbr the schwa plural of inflec- 
tional (:lass NS. Ill figure 2 l;he attribute ftype stands 
fbr the intlectional class. The attributes flex, surf, 
and base represent strings, namely the inflectional 
ending, surface (i.e. inflected) tbrm, and base form 
respectively. The symbol @ denotes the reduced 
vowel \[o\] (schwa), and - designates negated values. 
Lexical entries are assmned only for basic lexical 
signs (i.e. uninflected but possibly derived or com- 
pounded). Inflected lexical signs result from the in- 
teraction of these lexical entries and the inflectional 
sehenlata. Figure 3 gives the basic lexical sign (with 
the onfission of feature specifications that are irrel- 
ewmt for this discussion) for Hund 'dog', which is 
of class NS, followed by the inflected lexical sign tbr 
Hunde 'dogs', in which the value of the attribute 
moph (i.e. morphophonology) is an extension of the 
schema for schwa phlral given in figure 2. 
The inflectional classes assigned to basic lexical 
signs are modelled as formal types in the hierarchi- 
cal structure specified in figure 4. Note that the 
leaves of this tree correspond exactly to the inflec- 
tional classes of German nouns as described above 
in {}2.

(;ions as shown in nominative plural Zcit-cn 'tinles' 
but Gabel-n 'forks' are also covered ill our descrip- 
tion. Here (he real(sat(on of the plural ending -'n 
del)ends on the shape of tlm noun steul (nalnely, 
whether or not it ends in a schwa syllable). In 
agreement with (Bird and Klein, 1994) and (Er\]avec, 
1996), we capture such alternations declaratively in
a one-level model without recourse to transducers. 
Our treatment of umlaut adopts part of the tech- 
niques of (%'ost, 1993). 
4 Process ing  unknown words  
In our al)proach linguistic prol)erties of unlcnown 
words are inferred fl'om their sentential context as 
a byproduct of parsing. After parsing, which re- 
quires only a slight modification of sl;andard lexi- 
cal lookup, lexical entries are al)propriately updated. 
One of our key ideas is a gradual, information-based 
concept of "unknownness", where lexical entries are 
not unknown as a whole, but may contain unknown, 
i.e. potentially revisable, pieces of information (cf. 
Barg and Walther (1998)). This allows a uniform 
treatment for tile full range of lexical entries from 
completely known to maximally unknown. As dis- 
cussed in (Barg and Walther, 1998), our system has 
been implemented in MicroCUF, a derivative of the 
tbrmalism CUF of (DSrre and Dorna, 1993).

I{evisable intbrmagion is fllrl;her classitied an spc- 
cializable or generalizable, where the tbrmer can only 
become 111or0 special, and I;he lal;l;er only lllOrO gen- 
eral, with furl;her cont;exts. Spe(:ializable ldnds of 
infbrmal;ion include seman(;ic t;ype of nouns, gen- 
(ler, and intleci;iolml class. Among the generalizable, 
kinds of intbrmaCion a.re i;he selecl;ional rcsl;rictions 
of verbs and adjecl;ivcs as well as (~hc case of nOUllS. 
Both kinds of intbrmaI;ion roger;her wil;h nonrevis- 
able (i.e. st, ri(:t) iutkn'mal;ion can cooccur in a single 
ent.ry. 
The overall approach in compatil)le wit;h sl;andard

tra demands ()11 the grmnmar,  tlere, l;he revisable in- 
tormal;ion musl: 1)e e, xl) lMIly lnarkcd as such. Since

feagurc-based formalisms (of. Carpentx~r (1992)), 
revisable information is expressed lit terms of fin'- 
real tyt)es. The iniIJal values fin' revisable intbr- 
mat ion arc, specified with (;wo dist;inguished 1;ypes 
u_.s and u-9 for specializable and generalizable in- 
formation, resi)ect;ively. Type tmiticai;ion can be 
employed for the combinat ion of sl>ecializable inf'or- 
mat.ion, whereas generalizable illtbrmatioll requires 
l,ype lllli()ll. 
The (lirecl; combim~l;i(m of revisable informal;ion 
(luring parsing is mffeasible for various reasons dis- 
cussed in (Barg and \Vail;her, 1.998). It; conscquenl;ly

In order to process llllklloWll word forms, we posl;tl- 
late canonical lexical entries which are ret;urned by 
lexical lookup if a word is hog recorded in the lexicon. 
For nomls, Ichis enI;ry corresponds 1;o an mlderspeci- 
fled basic lexical sign in which l;he inflectional class, 
case, number, and gender are specitled with revis- 
able types, i.e. the information can be acquired and 
updaix'~d. Figure 5 shows (;he basic lexical sigll for 
German norms (with the Olllissioll of tbai;m'e Sl)eciti-

and gender (gend) are specializable, case is general- 
izable and hence contains the features gen and ctxt. 
Note that the initial values for specializable infor- 
mation consist of a disjunction (;) of the value u_s 
and the most general appropriate value for the corre- 
sponding feature. This ensures the identification of 
specializable infornlation (via ~t_s) on the one hand, 
and the correct specializations on the other. 
\Vhen a sentence containing an tlnknown noun is 
parsed, infbrmation about the noun conies from dif- 
ferent som'ces: while the surrounding context lnay 
supply agreement information, the word fornl itself 
together with morphol)honological constraints may 
restrict the possible inflectional class. 
As an examt)le we can suppose that the rather in- 
frequent noun Sund 'sound', 'strait', which like It'und 
'dog' belongs to class NS but is unfalniliar to inany 
German speakers, is not recorded in a given lexicon. 
The class NS contains both masculine and neuter 
nouns, and these differ ill none of their inflected 
forms. Thus, only agreement information from a 
context, such as dcr cnge ?'und 'the narrow strait' 
(nonfinative), call establish the gender of S.w(td as 
being masculine.

Even in isolation, the forln Sund must be singu- 
lar since its final shape is not coml)atible with any 
phlral inflection (i.e. it ends neither ill -s nor ill a 
schwa syllable). Moreover, the morphoplionological 
constraiuts on stems allow only three possibilities: 
S'und is 
? femiuine (and then tile class is NA, NU, or NM 
and tile case is underspecified) 
? nonfenfinine and weak (i.e. (:lass NWN or 
NWS) (and tlmn the case must be nominative) 
? nonfbminine and nonweak (and then the case is 
not genitive) 
These hypotheses are captured in the three feature 
structures depicted in figure 6. 
As we have seen, when a word is parsed in context, 
this provides additional information. If we know, for 
exalnple, that S~tnd is lnasculine, the first hypothesis 
is excluded, and the gender specification of the re- 
maining two hylmtheses can be specializ&l to masc. 
If we additionally encounter S'und ill dative singu- 
lar, which is impossible for weak nouns (which nmst 
have a final -n), then only the third hypothesis re- 
mains. Finally, if the plural form S'undc occurs the 
system can specialize the inflectional class exactly to 
the type NS. The other morphological information 
cammt be further generalized or specialized, and we 
have the final lexical entry fbr Sund. 
Things are not always this easy. In particular, 
there may be a number of alternatives both fbr the 
segmentation of a form into a stem and an inflec- 
tional ending and ibr the ~ssignment of a stein to a 
lexeme. Moreover, these alternatives may depend on 
each other. Thus, the form Lcincn may be assigned 
to any of the lexemes Lein 'flax' (masc, NS), Leine 
'rope' (fern, NM), or Leincn 'linen' (neut, NS); even 
in a context, e.g. F'ritz verkauft Leinen 'Fritz sells 
ropes/linen', it may be impossible to disambiguate 
the form. While the nouns Band 'book volume' 
(mase, NU), Band 'strip' (neut, NR), Band 'bond' 
(neut, NS, archaic and rare in singular), Band 'music 
band' (fern, NA), and Bande 'gang' (fern, NM) may 
be unlikely to occur all in the same context, they 
ilhlstrate the dimension of the t)roblems of segmen- 
tation and lexical assignnlent, which in turn coil-

stitute part of the more general 1)robleni of disam- 
Mguation in natural language processing. \Ve have 
no magic solution f'or the latter, but in our approach 
such examples must be handled with disjmwtive rep- 
resentations until the context 1)rovides the necessary 
disambiguating infornmtion. 
6 An  a l te rnat ive  mode l  us ing 
f inite-state techniques 
Alternatively, the incremental identifieation of in- 
flectional types can be modelled within the Dame- 
work of finite-state automata (cf. Sln'oat (1992)) 
without recourse to unification-based grammar for- 
malisms. A FSA can be defined that has an all)ha- 
1)et consisting of vectors specifying the stem shal)e 
and ending (and thus the segmentation) as well as 
tim agreenlcnt inforniation of possible word forms. 
Starting in an initial state corresponding to the con- 
straints that apply to all unknown words, the FSA 
is moved by successive forms of an unknown lexeme 
together with their agreement information into suc- 
cesso," states that capture the incrementally accrued 
inflectional intbrmation. The FSA may reach a final 
state, in which case tile intlectional class has l)een 
uniquely idenl;ified, or it nlay renmin in a nonfinal 
state. A lexic.on would siml)ly recoM tile latest state 
roached for each ll()llll. 
Imlflcnlentation of t.his model is greatly compli- 
cated by the problems of (lisambiguation just dis- 
cussed in {i5. In general, the states of the FSA must 
capture disjmmtions not only of intlectional classes, 
lint also of segmentation and gender alternatives. 
The application of automatic induction techniques 
to corpora appears to be essential, and we are cur- 
rently f)ursuing possibilities for this. 
7 Conc lus ion  
We have taken the inflec.tion of German nouns to il- 
lustrate a general tyl)e-based at/1)roach to handling 
ultkltowll words alia the illcrelllental accrual of their 
lexical information. The techniques can be al)l/lied 
not only to other classes of inflected words and to 
other languages, 1)ut also to other aspects of lexical 
informal;ion such as the valency of verbs. This may 
allow practical systems for natural anguage process- 
ing to be enhanced so as to utilize input infornlation 
that otherwise is discarded as noise.
