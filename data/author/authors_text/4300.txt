Abstract
We present an approach to semantic role
labeling (SRL) that takes the output of
multiple argument classifiers and com-
bines them into a coherent predicate-
argument output by solving an optimiza-
tion problem. The optimization stage,
which is solved via integer linear pro-
gramming, takes into account both the rec-
ommendation of the classifiers and a set
of problem specific constraints, and is thus
used both to clean the classification results
and to ensure structural integrity of the fi-
nal role labeling. We illustrate a signifi-
cant improvement in overall SRL perfor-
mance through this inference.
1 SRL System Architecture
Our SRL system consists of four stages: prun-
ing, argument identification, argument classifica-
tion, and inference. In particular, the goal of pruning
and argument identification is to identify argument
candidates for a given verb predicate. The system
only classifies the argument candidates into their
types during the argument classification stage. Lin-
guistic and structural constraints are incorporated
in the inference stage to resolve inconsistent global
predictions. The inference stage can take as its input
the output of the argument classification of a single
system or of multiple systems. We explain the infer-
ence for multiple systems in Sec. 2.
1.1 Pruning
Only the constituents in the parse tree are considered
as argument candidates. In addition, our system ex-
ploits the heuristic introduced by (Xue and Palmer,
2004) to filter out very unlikely constituents. The
heuristic is a recursive process starting from the verb
whose arguments are to be identified. It first returns
the siblings of the verb; then it moves to the parent of
the verb, and collects the siblings again. The process
goes on until it reaches the root. In addition, if a con-
stituent is a PP (propositional phrase), its children
are also collected. Candidates consisting of only a
single punctuation mark are not considered.
This heuristic works well with the correct parse
trees. However, one of the errors by automatic
parsers is due to incorrect PP attachment leading to
missing arguments. To attempt to fix this, we con-
sider as arguments the combination of any consec-
utive NP and PP, and the split of NP and PP inside
the NP that was chosen by the previous heuristics.
1.2 Argument Identification
The argument identification stage utilizes binary
classification to identify whether a candidate is an
argument or not. We train and apply the binary clas-
sifiers on the constituents supplied by the pruning
stage. Most of the features used in our system are
standard features, which include
? Predicate and POS tag of predicate indicate the lemma
of the predicate and its POS tag.
? Voice indicates tbe voice of the predicate.
? Phrase type of the constituent.
? Head word and POS tag of the head word include head
word and its POS tag of the constituent. We use rules
introduced by (Collins, 1999) to extract this feature.
? First and last words and POS tags of the constituent.
? Two POS tags before and after the constituent.
? Position feature describes if the constituent is before or
after the predicate relative to the position in the sentence.
181
? Path records the traversal path in the parse tree from the
predicate to the constituent.
? Subcategorization feature describes the phrase structure
around the predicate?s parent. It records the immediate
structure in the parse tree that expands to its parent.
? Verb class feature is the class of the active predicate de-
scribed in PropBank Frames.
? Lengths of the target constituent, in the numbers of words
and chunks separately.
? Chunk tells if the target argument is, embeds, overlaps,
or is embedded in a chunk with its type.
? Chunk pattern length feature counts the number of
chunks from the predicate to the argument.
? Clause relative position is the position of the target word
relative to the predicate in the pseudo-parse tree con-
structed only from clause constituent. There are four
configurations?target constituent and predicate share the
same parent, target constituent parent is an ancestor of
predicate, predicate parent is an ancestor of target word,
or otherwise.
? Clause coverage describes how much of the local clause
(from the predicate) is covered by the argument. It is
round to the multiples of 1/4.
1.3 Argument Classification
This stage assigns the final argument labels to the ar-
gument candidates supplied from the previous stage.
A multi-class classifier is trained to classify the
types of the arguments supplied by the argument
identification stage. To reduce the excessive candi-
dates mistakenly output by the previous stage, the
classifier can also classify the argument as NULL
(?not an argument?) to discard the argument.
The features used here are the same as those used
in the argument identification stage with the follow-
ing additional features.
? Syntactic frame describes the sequential pattern of the
noun phrases and the predicate in the sentence. This is
the feature introduced by (Xue and Palmer, 2004).
? Propositional phrase head is the head of the first phrase
after the preposition inside PP.
? NEG and MOD feature indicate if the argument is a
baseline for AM-NEG or AM-MOD. The rules of the
NEG and MOD features are used in a baseline SRL sys-
tem developed by Erik Tjong Kim Sang (Carreras and
Ma`rquez, 2004).
? NE indicates if the target argument is, embeds, overlaps,
or is embedded in a named-entity along with its type.
1.4 Inference
The purpose of this stage is to incorporate some
prior linguistic and structural knowledge, such as
?arguments do not overlap? or ?each verb takes at
most one argument of each type.? This knowledge is
used to resolve any inconsistencies of argument clas-
sification in order to generate final legitimate pre-
dictions. We use the inference process introduced
by (Punyakanok et al, 2004). The process is formu-
lated as an integer linear programming (ILP) prob-
lem that takes as inputs the confidences over each
type of the arguments supplied by the argument clas-
sifier. The output is the optimal solution that maxi-
mizes the linear sum of the confidence scores (e.g.,
the conditional probabilities estimated by the argu-
ment classifier), subject to the constraints that en-
code the domain knowledge.
Formally speaking, the argument classifier at-
tempts to assign labels to a set of arguments, S1:M ,
indexed from 1 to M . Each argument Si can take
any label from a set of argument labels, P , and the
indexed set of arguments can take a set of labels,
c1:M ? PM . If we assume that the argument classi-
fier returns an estimated conditional probability dis-
tribution, Prob(Si = ci), then, given a sentence, the
inference procedure seeks an global assignment that
maximizes the following objective function,
c?1:M = argmax
c1:M?PM
M
?
i=1
Prob(Si = ci),
subject to linguistic and structural constraints. In
other words, this objective function reflects the ex-
pected number of correct argument predictions, sub-
ject to the constraints. The constraints are encoded
as the followings.
? No overlapping or embedding arguments.
? No duplicate argument classes for A0-A5.
? Exactly one V argument per predicate considered.
? If there is C-V, then there has to be a V-A1-CV pattern.
? If there is an R-arg argument, then there has to be an arg
argument.
? If there is a C-arg argument, there must be an arg argu-
ment; moreover, the C-arg argument must occur after arg.
? Given the predicate, some argument types are illegal (e.g.
predicate ?stalk? can take only A0 or A1). The illegal
types may consist of A0-A5 and their corresponding C-
arg and R-arg arguments. For each predicate, we look
for the minimum value of i such that the class Ai is men-
tioned in its frame file as well as its maximum value j.
All argument types Ak such that k < i or k > j are
considered illegal.
182
2 Inference with Multiple SRL Systems
The inference process allows a natural way to com-
bine the outputs from multiple argument classi-
fiers. Specifically, given k argument classifiers
which perform classification on k argument sets,
{S1, . . . , Sk}. The inference process aims to opti-
mize the objective function:
c?1:N = argmax
c1:N?PN
N
?
i=1
Prob(Si = ci),
where S1:N = ?ki=1 Si, and
Prob(Si = ci) = 1k
k
?
j=1
Probj(Si = ci),
where Probj is the probability output by system j.
Note that all systems may not output with the
same set of argument candidates due to the pruning
and argument identification. For the systems that do
not output for any candidate, we assign the proba-
bility with a prior to this phantom candidate. In par-
ticular, the probability of the NULL class is set to be
0.6 based on empirical tests, and the probabilities of
the other classes are set proportionally to their oc-
currence frequencies in the training data.
For example, Figure 1 shows the two candidate
sets for a fragment of a sentence, ?..., traders say,
unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and
futures.? In this example, system A has two argu-
ment candidates, a1 = ?traders? and a4 = ?the sell-
ing panic in both stocks and futures?; system B has
three argument candidates, b1 = ?traders?, b2 = ?the
selling panic?, and b3 = ?in both stocks and fu-
tures?. The phantom candidates are created for a2,
a3, and b4 of which probability is set to the prior.
Specifically for this implementation, we first train
two SRL systems that use Collins? parser and Char-
niak?s parser respectively. In fact, these two parsers
have noticeably different output. In evaluation, we
run the system that was trained with Charniak?s
parser 5 times with the top-5 parse trees output by
Charniak?s parser1. Together we have six different
outputs per predicate. Per each parse tree output, we
ran the first three stages, namely pruning, argument

identification, and argument classification. Then a
joint inference stage is used to resolve the incon-
sistency of the output of argument classification in
these systems.
3 Learning and Evaluation
The learning algorithm used is a variation of the
Winnow update rule incorporated in SNoW (Roth,
1998; Roth and Yih, 2002), a multi-class classi-
fier that is tailored for large scale learning tasks.
SNoW learns a sparse network of linear functions,
in which the targets (argument border predictions
or argument type predictions, in this case) are rep-
resented as linear functions over a common feature
space. It improves the basic Winnow multiplicative
update rule with a regularization term, which has the
effect of trying to separate the data with a large mar-
gin separator (Grove and Roth, 2001; Hang et al,
2002) and voted (averaged) weight vector (Freund
and Schapire, 1999).
Softmax function (Bishop, 1995) is used to con-
vert raw activation to conditional probabilities. If
there are n classes and the raw activation of class i
is acti, the posterior estimation for class i is
Prob(i) = e
acti
?
1?j?n eactj
.
In summary, training used both full and partial
syntactic information as described in Section 1. In
training, SNoW?s default parameters were used with
the exception of the separator thickness 1.5, the use
of average weight vector, and 5 training cycles. The
parameters are optimized on the development set.
Training for each system took about 6 hours. The
evaluation on both test sets which included running

4 Conclusions
We present an implementation of SRL system which
composed of four stages?1) pruning, 2) argument
identification, 3) argument classification, and 4) in-
ference. The inference provides a natural way to
take the output of multiple argument classifiers and
combines them into a coherent predicate-argument
output. Significant improvement in overall SRL per-
formance through this inference is illustrated.
