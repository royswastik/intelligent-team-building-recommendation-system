Abstract
We report about the current state of development of a
document suite and its applications. This collection of
tools for the flexible and robust processing of documents
in German is based on the use of XML as unifying for-
malism for encoding input and output data as well as
process information. It is organized in modules with
limited responsibilities that can easily be combined into
pipelines to solve complex tasks. Strong emphasis is laid
on a number of techniques to deal with lexical and con-
ceptual gaps that are typical when starting a new appli-
cation.
Introduction
We have designed and implemented the XDOC docu-
ment suite as a workbench for the flexible processing of
electronically available documents in German. We have
decided to exploit XML (Bray et al, 1998) and its ac-
companying formalisms (e.g. XSLT (Site, 2002b)) and
tools (e.g. xt (Clark, 2002) ) as a unifying framework.
All modules in the XDOC system expect XML docu-
ments as input and deliver their results in XML format.
XML ? and ist precursor SGML ? offers a formal-
ism to annotate pieces of (natural language) texts. To be
more precise: If a text is (as a simple first approximation)
seen as a sequence of characters (alphabetic and white-
space characters) then XML allows to associate arbitrary
markup with arbitrary subsequences of contiguous char-
acters. Many linguistic units of interest are represented
by strings of contiguous characters (e.g. words, phrases,
clauses etc.). To use XML to encode information about
such a substring of a text interpreted as a meaningful lin-
guistic unit and to associate this information directly with
the occurrence of the unit in the text is a straightforward
idea. The basic idea is further backed by XMLs demand
that XML elements have to be properly nested. This is
fully concordant with standard linguistic practice: com-
plex structures are made up from simpler structures cov-
ering substrings of the full string in a nested way.
The end users of our applications are domain experts
(e.g. medical doctors, engineers, ...). They are interested
in getting their problems solved but they are typically
neither interested nor trained in computational linguis-
tics. Therefore the barrier to overcome before they can
use a computational linguistics or text technology system
should be as low as possible.
This experience has consequences for the design of
the document suite. The work in the XDOC project is
guided by the following design principles that have been
abstracted from a number of experiments and applica-
tions with ?realistic? documents (i.a. emails, abstracts of
scientific papers, technical documentation, ...):
 The tools shall be usable for ?realistic? documents.
One aspect of ?realistic? documents is that they typi-
cally contain domain-specific tokens that are not di-
rectly covered by classical lexical categories (like
noun, verb, ...). Those tokens are nevertheless often
essential for the user of the document (e.g. an en-
zyme descriptor like EC 4.1.1.17 for a biochemist).
 The tools shall be as robust as possible.
In general it can not be expected that lexicon in-
formation is available for all tokens in a document.
This is not only the case for most tokens from ?non-
lexical? types ? like telephone numbers, enzyme
names, material codes, ... ?, even for lexical types
there will always be ?lexical gaps?. This may either
be caused by neologisms or simply by starting to
process documents from a new application domain
with a new sublanguage. In the latter case lexical
items will typically be missing in the lexicon (?lex-
ical gap?) and phrasal structures may not or not ad-
equately be covered by the grammar.
 The tools shall be usable independently but shall al-
low for flexible combination and interoperability.
 The tools shall not only be usable by developers but
as well by domain experts without linguistic train-
ing.
Here again XML and XSLT play a major role: XSL
stylesheets can be exploited to allow different presen-
tations of internal data and results for different target
groups; for end users the internals are in many cases not
helpful, whereas developers will need them for debug-
ging.
The tools in the XDOC document suite can be grouped
according to their function:
 preprocessing
 structure detection
 POS tagging
 syntactic parsing
 semantic analysis
 tools for the specific application: e.g. information
extraction
In all tools the results of processing is encoded with
XML tags delimiting the respective piece of text. The
information conveyed by the tag name is enriched with
XML attributes and their resp. values.
Preprocessing
Tools for preprocessing are used to convert documents
from a number of formats into the XML format amenable
for further processing. As a subtask this includes treat-
ment of special characters (e.g. for umlauts, apostrophes,
...).
Structure detection
We accept raw ASCII texts without any markup as in-
put. In such cases structure detection tries to uncover
linguistic units (e.g. sentences, titles, ...) as candidates
for further analysis. A major subtask is to identify the
role of interpunction characters.
If we have the structures in a text explicitly available
this may be exploited by subsequent linguistic process-
ing. An example: For a unit classified as title or subtitle
you will accept an NP whereas within a paragraph you
will expect full sentences.
In realistic texts even the detection of possible sen-
tence boundaries needs some care. A period character
may not only be used as a full stop but may as well be part
of an abbreviation (e.g. ?z.B.? ? engl.: ?e.g.? ? or ?Dr.?),
be contained in a number (3.14), be used in an email ad-
dress or in domain specific tokens. The resources em-
ployed are special lexica (e.g. for abbreviations) and
finite automata for the reliable detection of token from
specialized non-lexical categories (e.g. enzyme names,
material codes, ...).
These resources are used here primarily to identify
those full stop characters that function as sentence de-
limiters (tagged as IP). In addition, the information about
the function of strings that include a period is tagged in
the result (e.g. ABBR).

POS tagging
To try to assign part-of-speech information to a token is
not only a preparatory step for parsing. The information
gained about a document by POS tagging and evaluating
its results is valuable in its own right. The ratio of to-
ken not classifiable by the POS tagger to token classified
may e.g. serve as an indication of the degree of lexical
coverage.
In principle a number of approaches is usable for POS
tagging (e.g. (Brill, 1992)). We decided to avoid ap-
proaches based on (supervised) learning from tagged cor-
pora, since the cost for creating the necessary training
data are likely to be prohibitive for our users (especially
in specialized sublanguages).
The approach chosen was to try to make best use of
available resources for German and to enhance them with
additional functionality. The tool chosen is not only used
in POS tagging but serves as a general morpho-syntactic
component for German: MORPHIX.
The resources employed in XDOC?s POS tagger are:
- the lexicon and the inflectional analysis from the
morphosyntactic component MORPHIX
- a number of heuristics (e.g. for the classification of
token not covered in the lexicon)
For German the morphology component MORPHIX
(Finkler and Neumann, 1988) has been developed in a
number of projects and is available in different realisa-
tions. This component has the advantage that the closed
class lexical items of German as well as all irregular
verbs are covered. The coverage of open class lexical
items is dependent on the amount of lexical coding. The
paradigms for e.g. verb conjugation and noun declina-
tion are fully covered but to be able to analyze and gen-
erate word forms their roots need to be included in the
MORPHIX lexicon.
We exploit MORPHIX - in addition to its role in
syntactic parsing - for POS tagging as well. If a to-
ken in a German text can be morphologically analysed
with MORPHIX the resulting word class categorisation
is used as POS information. Note that this classifica-
tion need not be unique. Since the tokens are analysed
in isolation multiple analyses are often the case. Some
examples: the token ?der? may either be a determiner
(with a number of different combinations for the features
case, number and gender) or a relative pronoun, the to-
ken ?liebe? may be either a verb or an adjective (again
with different feature combinations not relevant for POS
tagging).
In addition since we do not expect extensive lexicon
coding at the beginning of an XDOC application some
tokens will not get a MORPHIX analysis. We then em-
ploy two techniques: We first try to make use of heuris-
tics that are based on aspects of the tokens that can eas-
ily be detected with simple string analysis (e.g. upper-
/lowercase, endings, ...) and/or exploitation of the token
position relative to sentence boundaries (detected in the
structure detection module). If a heuristic yields a classi-
fication the resulting POS class is added together with the
name of the employed heuristic (marked as feature SRC,
cf. example 3). If no heuristics are applicable we classify
the token as member of the class unknown (tagged with
XXX).
To keep the POS tagger fast and simple the disam-
biguation between multiple POS classes for a token and
the derivation of a possible POS class from context for
an unknown token are postponed to syntactic processing.
This is in line with our general principle to accept results
with overgeneration when a module is applied in isola-
tion (here: POS tagging) and to rely on filtering ambigu-
ous results in a later stage of processing (here: exploiting
the syntactic context).
Example 2 domain-specific tagging
<PRODUCT Method="Sandguss" Material="CC333G">
<N>Gussstueck</N>
<NORM>
<N>EN</N>
<NR>1982</NR>
</NORM>
<IP>-</IP>
<MAT-ID>CC333G</MAT-ID>
<IP>-</IP>
<METHODE>GS</METHODE>
<IP>-</IP>
<MODELLNR>XXXX</MODELLNR>
</PRODUCT>
The example above is the result of tagging a domain-
specific identifier. The token is annotated as a PROD-
UCT with description of the used method and material.
It is a typical token in the domain of casting technology.
Syntactic parsing
For syntactic parsing we apply a chart parser based
on context free grammar rules augmented with feature
structures.
Again robustness is achieved by allowing as input ele-
ments:
 multiple POS classes,
 unknown classes of open world tokens and
 tokens with POS class, but without or only partial
feature information.
Example 3 unknown token classified as noun with
heuristics
<NP TYPE="COMPLEX" RULE="NPC3" GEN="FEM"
NUM="PL" CAS="_">
<NP TYPE="FULL" RULE="NP1" CAS="_"
NUM="PL" GEN="FEM">
<N SRC="UNG">Blutanhaftungen</N>
</NP>
<PP CAS="DAT">
<PRP CAS="DAT">an</PRP>
<NP TYPE="FULL" RULE="NP2" CAS="DAT"
NUM="SG" GEN="FEM">
<DETD>der</DETD>
<N SRC="UC1">Gekroesewurzel</N>
</NP>
</PP>
</NP>
The latter case results from some heuristics in POS
tagging that allow to assume e.g. the class noun for a
token but do not suffice to detect its full paradigm from
the token (note that there are ca two dozen different mor-
phosyntactic paradigms for noun declination in German).
For a given input the parser attempts to find all com-
plete analyses that cover the input. If no such complete
analysis is achievable it is attempted to combine maximal
partial results into structures covering the whole input.
A successful analysis may be based on an assump-
tion about the word class of an initially unclassified to-
ken (tagged XXX). This is indicated in the parsing result
(feature AS) and can be exploited for learning such clas-
sifications from contextual constraints. In a similar way
the successful combination from known feature values
from closed class items (e.g. determiners, prepositions)
with underspecified features in agreement constraints al-
lows the determination of paradigm information from
successfully processed occurrences. In example 4 fea-
tures of the unknown word ?Mundhoehle? could be de-
rived from the features of the determiner within the PP.
Example 4 unknown token classified as adjective and
features derived through contextual constraints
<NP TYPE="COMPLEX" RULE="NPC3" GEN="MAS" NUM="SG"
CAS="NOM">
<NP TYPE="FULL" RULE="NP3" CAS="NOM" NUM="SG"
GEN="MAS">
<DETI>kein</DETI>
<XXX AS="ADJ">ungehoeriger</XXX>
<N>Inhalt</N>
</NP>
<PP CAS="DAT">
<PRP CAS="DAT">in</PRP>
<NP TYPE="FULL" RULE="NP2" CAS="DAT" NUM="SG"
GEN="FEM">
<DETD>der</DETD>
<N SRC="UC1">Mundhoehle</N>
</NP>
</PP>
</NP>"
The grammar used in syntactic parsing is organized in
a modular way that allows to add or remove groups of
rules. This is exploited when the sublanguage of a do-
main contains linguistic structures that are unusual or
even ungrammatical in standard German.
Example 5 Excerpt from syntactic analysis
<PP CAS="AKK">
<PRP CAS="AKK">durch</PRP>
<NP TYPE="COMPLEX" RULE="NPC1" GEN="NTR" NUM="SG"
CAS="AKK">
<NP TYPE="FULL" RULE="NP1" CAS="AKK" NUM="SG"
GEN="NTR">

<NP TYPE="FULL" RULE="NP2" CAS="GEN" NUM="SG"
GEN="MAS">

<N>Zusammenhalts</N>
</NP>
</NP>
</PP>
Semantic analysis
At the time of writing semantic analysis uses three meth-
ods:
Semantic tagging
For semantic tagging we apply a semantic lexicon. This
lexicon contains the semantic interpretation of a token
and a case frame combined with the syntactic valence re-
quirements. Similar to POS tagging the tokens are anno-
tated with their meaning and a classification in seman-
tic categories like e.g. concepts and relations. Again
it is possible, that the classification of a token in iso-
lation is not unique. Multiple classification can be re-
solved through the following analysis of the case frame
and through its combination with the syntactic structure
which includes the token.
Analysis of case frames
By the case frame analysis of a token we obtain details
about the type of recognized concepts (resolving multi-
ple interpretations) and possible relations to other con-
cepts. The results are tagged with XML tags. The fol-
lowing example describes the DTD for the annotation of
the results of case frame analysis.
Example 6 DTD for the annotation by case frame anal-
ysis
<!ELEMENT CONCEPTS (CONCEPT)*>
<!ELEMENT CONCEPT (WORD, DESC, SLOTS?)>
<!ATTLIST CONCEPT TYPE CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT WORD (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT DESC (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT SLOTS (RELATION+)>
<!ELEMENT RELATION (ASSIGN_TO, FORM, CONTENT)>
<!ATTLIST RELATION TYPE CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ELEMENT ASSIGN_TO (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT FORM (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT CONTENT (#PCDATA)>
We use attributes to show the description of the con-
cepts and we can annotate the relevant relations between
the concepts through nested tags (e.g. the tag SLOTS).
Example 7 Excerpt from case frame analysis
<CONCEPT TYPE=Prozess>
<WORD>Fertigen</WORD>
<DESC>Schaffung von etwas</DESC>
<SLOTS>
<RELATION>
<RESULT FORM="N(gen, fak) P(akk, fak, von)">
fester Koerper</RESULT>
<SOURCE FORM="P(dat, fak, aus)">aus formlosem
Stoff </SOURCE>
<INSTRUMENT FORM="P(akk, fak, durch)">durch
Schaffen des Zusammen-
halts</INSTRUMENT>
</RELATION>
</SLOTS>
</CONCEPT>
The example above is part of the result of the analysis
of the German phrase: Fertigen fester Koerper aus form-
losem Stoff durch Schaffen des Zusammenhalts1. The to-
ken Fertigen is classified as process with the relations
source, result and instrument. The following phrases
(noun phrases and preposition phrases) are checked to
make sure that they are assignable to the relation require-
ments (semantic and syntactic) of the token Fertigen.
Semantic interpretation of the syntactic structure
An other step to analyze the relations between tokens can
be the interpretation of the syntactic structure of a phrase
or sentences respectively. We exploit the syntactic struc-
ture of the sublanguage to extract the relation between
several tokens. For example a typical phrase from an au-
topsy report: Leber dunkelrot.2
From semantic tagging we obtain the following infor-
mation:
Example 8 results of semantic tagging
<CONCEPT TYPE="organ">Leber</CONCEPT>
<PROPERTY TYPE="color">dunkelrot</PROPERTY>
<XXX>.</XXX>
In this example we can extract the relation ?has-color?
between the tokens Leber and dunkelrot. This is an ex-
ample of a simple semantic relation. Other semantic rela-
tions can be described through more complex variations.
In these cases we must consider linguistic structures like
modifiers (e.g. etwas), negations (e.g. nicht), coordi-
nations (e.g. Beckengeruest unversehrt und fest gefuegt)
and noun groups (e.g. Bauchteil der grossen Koerper-
schlagader).
Current state and future work
The XDOC document workbench is currently employed
in a number of applications. These include:
 knowledge acquisition from technical documenta-
tion about casting technology
 extraction of company profiles from WWW pages
 analysis of autopsy protocols
The latter application is part of a joint project with
the institute for forensic medicine of our university. The
medical doctors there are interested in tools that help
them to exploit their huge collection of several thousand
autopsy protocols for their research interests. The con-
frontation with this corpus has stimulated experiments
with ?bootstrapping techniques? for lexicon and ontology
creation.
The core idea is the following:
When you are confronted with a new corpus from a
new domain, try to find linguistic structures in the text
that are easy to detect automatically and that allow to
1In English: production of solid objects from formless matter by
creating cohesion
2In English: Liver dark red.
classify unknown terms in a robust manner both syntac-
tically as well as on the knowledge level. Take the results
from a run of these simple but robust heuristics as an ini-
tial version of a domain dependent lexicon and ontology.
Exploit these initial resources to extend the processing to
more complicated linguistic structures in order to detect
and classify more terms of interest automatically.
An example: In the sublanguage of autopsy proto-
cols (in German) a very telegrammatic style is dominant.
Condensed and compact structures like the following are
very frequent:
Harnblase leer.
Harnleiter frei.
Nierenoberflaeche glatt.
Vorsteherdruese altersentsprechend.
. . .
These structures can be abstracted syntactically as
NounAdjectiveFullstop and semantically as
reporting a finding in the form Anatomic-entity
has Attribute-value and they are easily detectable
(Ro?sner and Kunze, 2002).
In our experiments we have exploited this characteris-
tic of the corpus extensively to automatically deduce an
initial lexicon (with nouns and adjectives) and ontology
(with concepts for anatomic regions or organs and their
respective features and values). The feature values were
further exploited to cluster the concept candidates into
groups according to their feature values. In this way con-
tainer like entities with feature values like ?leer? (empty)
or ?gefuellt? (full) can be distinguished from e.g. entities
of surface type with feature values like ?glatt? (smooth).
Related Work
The work in XDOC has been inspired by a number of
precursory projects:
In GATE (Site, 2002a; Cunningham and Wilks, 1988)
the idea of piping simple modules in order to achieve
complex functionality has been applied to NLP with such
a rigid architecture for the first time. The project LT
XML has been pioneering XML as a data format for lin-
guistic processing.
Both GATE and LT XML ((LTG), 1999) were em-
ployed for processing English texts. SMES (Neumann
et al, 1997) has been an attempt to develop a toolbox
for message extraction from German texts. A disadvan-
tage of SMES that is avoided in XDOC is the lack of a
uniform encoding formalism, in other words, users are
confronted with different encodings and formats in each
module.
System availability
Major components of XDOC are made publicly accessi-
ble for testing and experiments under the URL:

Summary
We have reported about the current state of the XDOC
document suite. This collection of tools for the flexible
and robust processing of documents in German is based
on the use of XML as unifying formalism for encoding
input and output data as well as process information. It
is organized in modules with limited responsibilities that
can easily be combined into pipelines to solve complex
tasks. Strong emphasis is laid on a number of techniques
to deal with lexical and conceptual gaps and to guarantee
robust systems behaviour without the need for a priori in-
vestment in resource creation by users. When end users
are first confronted with the system they typically are in-
terested in quick progress in their application but should
not be forced to be engaged e.g. in lexicon build up and
grammar debugging, before being able to start with ex-
periments. This is not to say that creation of specialized
lexicons is unnecessary. There is a strong correlation be-
tween prior investment in resources and improved per-
formance and higher quality of results. Our experience
shows that initial results in experiments are a good mo-
tivation for subsequent efforts of users and investment in
extended and improved linguistic resources but that a pri-
ori costs may be blocking the willingness of users to get
really involved.
