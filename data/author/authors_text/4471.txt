In this paper, we present a corpus- 
based learning method that can 
index diverse types of compound 
nouns using rules automatically ex- 
tracted from a large tagged corpus. 
We develop an efficient way of ex- 
tracting the compound noun index- 
ing rules automatically and perform 
extensive experiments to evaluate 
our indexing rules. The automatic 
learning method shows about the 
same performance compared with 
the manual inguistic approach but 
is more portable and requires no 
human efforts. We also evaluate 
the seven different filtering meth- 
ods based on both the effectiveness 
and the efficiency, and present a 
new method to solve the problems of 
compound noun over-generation a d 
data sparseness in statistical com- 
pound noun processing. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Compound nouns are more specific and ex- 
pressive than simple nouns, so they are more 
valuable as index terms and can increase 
the precision in search experiments. There 
are many definitions for the compound noun 
which cause ambiguities as to whether a given 
continuous noun sequence is a compound 
noun or not. We, therefore, need a clean

definition of compound nouns in terms of in- 
formation retrieval, so we define a compound 
noun as "any continuous noun sequence that 
appears frequently in documents." 1 
In Korean documents, compound nouns are 
represented in various forms (shown in Table 
1), so there is a difficulty in indexing all types 
of compound nouns. Until now, there have 
been much works on compound noun index- 
ing, but they still have limitations of cover- 
ing all types of compound nouns and require 
much linguistic knowledge to accomplish this 
goal. In this paper, we propose a corpus- 
based learning method for compound noun 
indexing which can extract he rules automat- 
ically with little linguistic knowledge.

noun with regard to "jeong-bo geom-saeg (in- 
formation retrieval)"

As the number of the documents i growing 
retrieval, efficiency also becomes as important 
as effectiveness. To increase the efficiency, we 
focus on reducing the number of indexed spu- 
rious compound nouns. We perform experi- 
ments on several filtering methods to find the 
algorithm that can reduce spurious compound 
nouns most efficiently.

ing to application systems.

The remainder of this paper ? is organized 
as follows. Section 2 describes previous com- 
pound noun indexing methods for Korean and 
compound noun filtering methods. We show 
overall compound noun indexing system ar- 
chitecture in Section 3, and expl~.~n each mod- 
ule of the system in Section 4 and 5 in de- 
tail. We evaluate our method with standard 
Korean test collections in Section 6. Finally, 
concluding remarks are given in Section 7. 
2 P rev ious  Research  
2.1 Compound Noun Indexing 
There have been two different methods 
for compound noun indexing: statistical 
and linguistic. In one Statistical method, 
(Fagan, 1989) indexed phrases using six 
different parameters, including information 
on co-occurrence of phrase elements, rela- 
tive location of phrase elements, etc., and 
achieved reasonable performance. However, 
his method couldn't reveal consistent sub- 
stantial improvements on five experimental 
document collections in effectiveness. (Strza- 
lkowski et al, 1996; Evans and Zhai, 1996) 
indexed subcompounds from complex noun 
phrases using noun-phrase analysis. These 
methods need to find the head-modifier rela- 
tions from noun phrases and therefore require 
difficult syntactic parsing in Korean. 
For Korean, in one statistical method, (Lee 
and Ahn, 1996) indexed general Korean nouns 
using n-grams without linguistic knowledge 
and the experiment results showed that the 
proposed method might be Mmost as effec- 
tive as the linguistic noun indexing. How- 
ever, this method can generate many spuri- 
ous n-grarn~ which decrease the precision in 
search performance. In linguistic methods, 
(Kim, 1994) used five manually chosen com- 
pound noun indexing rule patterns based on 
linguistic knowledge. However, this method 
cannot index the diverse types of compound 
nouns. (Won et al, 2000) used a full parser 
and increased the precision in search experi- 
ments. However, this linguistic method can- 
not be applied to unrestricted texts robustly. 
In summary, the previous methods, 
whether they are statistical or linguistic, 
have their own shortcomings. Statistical 
methods require signiAcant amounts of 
co-occurrence information for reasonable 
performance and can not index the diverse 
types of compound nouns. Linguistic meth- 
ods need compound noun indexing rules 
described by human and sometimes result 
in meaningless compound nouns, which 
decreases the performance of information 
retrieval systems. They cannot also cover the 
various types of compound nouns because of 
the limitation of human linguistic knowledge. 
In this paper, we present a hybrid method 
that uses linguistic rules but these rules are 
automatically acquired from a large corpus 
through statistical learning. Our method gen- 
erates more diverse compound noun index- 
ing rule patterns than the previous tandard 
methods (Kim, 1994; Lee et ah, 1997), be- 
cause previous methods use only most gen- 
eral rule patterns (shown in Table 2) and are 
based solely on human linguistic knowledge.

(The two nouns before and after a slash 
in the pattern can form a single compound noun.) 
2.2 Compound Noun F i l ter ing 
Compound noun indexing methods, whether 
they are statistical or linguistic, tend to gen- 
erate spurious compound nouns when they 
are actually applied. Since an information re- 
trieval system can be evaluated by its effec- 
tiveness and also by its efficiency (van Rijs- 
bergen, 1979), the spurious compound nouns 
should be efficiently filtered. (Kando et al, 
1998) insisted that, for Japanese, the smaller 
the number of index terms is, the better the 
performance of the information retrieval sys- 
tem should be. 
58 
For Korean, (Won et al, 2000) showed 
that segmentation f compound nouns is more 
efficient than compound noun synthesis in 
search performance. There have been many 
works on compound noun filtering methods; 
(Kim, 1994) used mutual information only, 
and (Yun et al, 1997) used mutual informa- 
tion and relative frequency of POS (Part-Of- 
Speech) pairs together. (Lee et ai., 1997) used 
stop word dictionaries which were constructed 
manually. Most of the previous methods for 
compound noun filtering utilized only one 
consistent method for generated compound 
nouns irrespective of the different origin of 
compound noun indexing rules, and the meth- 
ods cause many problems due to data sparse- 
hess in dictionary and training data. Our 
approach solves the data sparseness problem 
by using co-occurrence information on auto- 
matically extracted compound noun elements 
together with a statistical precision measure 
which fits best to each rule. 
3 Overa l l  Sys tem Arch i tec ture  
The compound noun indexing system pro- 
posed in this paper Consists of two major 
modules: one for automatically extracting 
compound noun indexing rules (in Figure 1) 
and the other for indexing documents, fil- 
tering the automatically generated compound 
nouns, and weighting the indexed compound 
nouns (in Figure 2).

4 Automat ic  Ext rac t ion  of  
Compound Noun Index ing  Ru les  
There are three major steps in automatically 
extracting compound noun indexing rules. 
The first step is to collect compound noun 
statistical information, and the second step is 
to extract the rules from a large tagged cor- 
pus using the collected statistical information. 
The final step is to learn each rule's precision.. 
4.1 Col lect ing Compound Noun 
Statist ics 
We collect initial compound noun seeds which 
were gathered from various types of well- 
balanced ocuments uch as ETRI Kemong 
encyclopaedia 2 nd many dictionaries on the 
Internet, and we collected 10,368 seeds, as 
shown in Table 3. The small number of seeds 
are bootstrapped to extract the Compound 
noun indexing rules for various corpora.

Internet dictionaries 2,071 1,109 3,180 
To collect more practical statistics on the 
compound nouns, we made a 1,000,000 eo- 
jeol(Korean spacing unit which corresponds

to an English word or phrase) tagged cor- 
pus for a compound noun indexing experi- 
ment from a large document set (Korean In- 
formation Base). We collected complete com- 
pound nouns (a continuous noun sequence 
composed of at least two nouns on the condi- 
tion that both the preceding and the following 
POS of the sequence axe not nouns (Yoon et 
al., 1998)) composed of 1 - 3 no, ms from the 
tagged training corpus (Table 4).

4.2  Ext rac t ing  Index ing  Ru les  
We define a template (in Table 5) to extract 
the compound noun indexing rules from a 
POS tagged corpus. 
The template means that if a front- 
condition-tag, a rear-condition-tag, and sub- 
string-tags are coincident with input sentence 
tags, the lexical item in the synthesis position 
of the sentence can be indexed as a compound 
noun as "x /  y (for 3-noun compounds, x / 
y / z)". The tags used in the template are 
POS (Part-Of-Speech) tags and we use the 
POSTAG set (Table 17). 
The following is an algorithm to extract 
compound noun indexing rules from a large 
tagged corpus using the two-noun compound 
seeds and the template defined above. The 
rule extraction scope is limited to the end 
of a sentence or, if there is a conjunctive 
ending (eCC) in the sentence, only to the 
conjunctive nding of the sentence. A rule 
extraction example is shown in Figure 3.

} 
} 
} 
The next step is to  refine the extracted 
rules to select he proper ones. We used a rule 
filtering algorithm (Algorithm 2) using the 
frequency together with the heuristics that 
the rules with negative lexical items (shown in 
Table 6) will make spurious compound nouns.

ing frequency and heuristics

the rules whose frequency is greater than 2. 
2. Among rules selected by step 1, select 
only rules that are extracted 
at least by 2 seeds. 
3. Discard rules which contain 
negative lexical items.

tered rules, there are 19 rules with negative 
lexical items and we finally selected 2,017 
rules. Table 7 shows a distribution of the final 
rules according to the number of elements in 
their sub-string-tags.

The automatically extracted rules have 
more rule patterns and lexical items than 
human-made rules so they can cover more 
diverse types of compound nouns (Table 8). 
When checking the overlap between the two 
rule collections, we found that the manual in- 
guistic rules are a subset of our automatically 
generated statistical rules. Table 9 shows 
some of the example rules newly generated 
from our extraction algorithm, which were 
originally missing in the manual rule patterns. 
4.3 Learning the Precision o f  
Ext racted  Rules 
In the proposed method, we use the precision 
of rules to solve the compound noun over- 
generation and the data sparseness problems. 
The precision of a rule can be defined by

cally extracted rules and the manual rules

counting how many indexed compound noun 
candidates generated by the rule are actual 
compound nouns: 
Yactuat 
Prec(rule) = Ncandidate 
where Prec(rule) is the precision of a rule, 
Ndctual is the number of actual compound 
nouns, and Ncandidat e is the number of com- 
pound noun candidates generated by the au- 
tomatic indexing rules. 
To  calculate the precision, we need a defin- 
ing measurement for compound noun identi- 
fication. (Su et al, 1994) showed that the 
average mutual information of a compound 
noun tends to be higher than that of a non- 
compound noun, so we try to use the mutual 
information as the measure for identifying the 
compound nouns. If the mutual information 
of the compound noun candidate is higher 
than the average mutual information of the 
compound noun seeds, we decide that it is 
a compound noun. For mutual information 
(MI), we use two different equations: one for 
two-element compound nouns (Church and 
Hanks, 1990) and the other for three-element 
compound nouns (Suet  al., 1994). The equa- 
tion for two-element compound nouns is as 
follow: 
P(x,y) 
I(x;y) = log 2 P(x) x P(y) 
61 
where x and y are two words in the corpus, 
and I(x; y) is the mutual information of these 
two words (in this order). Table 10 shows 
the average MI value of the two and three 
elements. 
Table 10: Average value of the mutual infor- 
mation (MI) of compound noun seeds 
.Number of elements \[ 2 I 3 
Average MI 3.56 3.62 
The MI was calculated from the statistics of 
the complete compound nouns collected from 
the tagged training corpus (see Section 4.1). 
However, complete compound nouns are 
continuous noun sequences and cause the 
data sparseness problem. Therefore, we need 
to expand the statistics. Figure 4 shows 
the architecture of the precision learning 
module by expanding the statistics of the 
complete compound nouns along with an 
algorithmic explanation (Algorithm 3) of the 
process. Table 11 shows the improvement in
the average precision during the repetitive 
execution of this learning process.

5 Compound Noun Index ing ,  
F i l te r ing ,  and  Weight ing  
In this section, we explai n how to use the au- 
tomatically extracted rules to actually index 
the compound nouns, and describe how to fil- 
ter and weight the indexed compound nouns. 
5.1 Compound Noun I ndex ing  
To index compound nouns from documents, 
we use a natural anguage processing engine, 
SKOPE (Standard KOrean Processing En- 
gine) (Cha et al, 1998), which processes doc- 
uments by analysing words into morphemes 
and tagging part-of-speeches. The tagging 
results are compared with the automatically 
learned compound noun indexing rules and, if 
they are coincident with each other, we index 
them as compound nouns. Figure 5 shows a 
process of the compound noun indexing with 
an example. 
5.2 Compound Noun F i l ter ing 
Among the indexed compound nouns above, 
still there can be meaningless compound 
nouns, which increases the number of index 
terms and the search time. To solve com- 
pound noun over-generation problem, we ex- 
periment with seven different filtering meth- 
ods (shown in Table 12) by analyzing their

relative effectiveness and efficiency, as shown 
in Table 16. These methods can be divided 
into three categories: first one using MI, sec- 
ond one using the frequency of the compound 
nouns (FC), and the last one using the fre- 
quency of the compound noun elements (FE). 
MI (Mutual Information) is a measure of word 
association, and used under the assumption 
that a highly associated word n-gram is more 
likely to be a compound noun. FC is used 
under the assumption that a frequently en- 
countered word n-gram is more likely to be a 
compound than a rarely encountered n-gram. 
FE is ;used under the assumption that a word 
n-gram with a frequently encountered specific 
element is more likely to be a compound. In 
the method of C, D, E, and F, each threshold 
was decided by calculating the average num- 
ber of compound nouns of each method.

(FE) F. Frequency of compound noun modifiers

G. No filtering 
(The value in parantheses is a threshold.) 
Among these methods, method B gener- 
ated the smallest number of compound nouns 
best efficiency and showed the reasonable f- 
fectiveness (Table 16). On the basis of this 
filtering method, we develop a smoothing 
method by combining the precision of rules 
with the mutual information of the compound 
noun elements, and propose our final filtering 
method (H) as follows: 
P(x, y) + ~ ? Precision T(x, y) = log 2 P(x) x P(y) 
where a is a weighting coefficient and Preci- 
sion is the applied rules learned in Section 4.3. 
For the three-element compound nouns, the 
MI part is replaced with the three-element MI
equation 3 (Su et al, 1994). 
6 Exper iment  Resu l ts  
To calculate the similarity between a docu- 
ment and a query, we use the p-norm retrieval 
model (Fox, 1983) and use 2.0 as the p-value. 
We also use fhe  component nouns in a com- 
pound as the indexing terms. We follow the 
standard TREC evaluation schemes (Salton 
and Buckley, 1991). For single index terms, 
we use the weighting method atn.ntc (Lee, 
1995). 
6.1 Compound Noun Index ing  
Exper iments  
This experiment shows how well the proposed 
method can index diverse types of compound 
nouns than the previous popular methods 
which use human-generated compound noun 
indexing rules (Kim, 1994; Lee et al, 1997). 
For simplicity, we filtered the generated com- 
pound nouns using the mutual information of 
the compound noun elements with a thresh- 
old of zero (method A in Table 12). 
Table 13 shows that the terms indexed by 
previous linguistic approach are a subset of 
the ones made by our statistical approach. 
This means that the proposed method can 
cover more diverse compound nouns than the

6.2 Retrieval Experiments Using 
Various Filtering Methods 
In this experiment, we compare the seven fil- 
tering methods to find out which one is the 
best in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. 
For this experiment, we used our automatic 
rules for the compound noun indexing, and 
the test collection KTSET2.0. To check the 
effectiveness, we used recall and l l -point  av- 
erage precision. To check the efficiency, we 
used the number of index terms. Table 16 
shows the results of the various filtering ex- 
periments. 
From Table 16, the methods using mu- 
tual information reduce the number of in- 
dex terms, whereas they have lower precision. 
The reason of this lower precision is that MI 
has a bias, i.e., scoring in favor of rare terms 
over common terms, so MI seems to have a 
problem in its sensitivity to probabil ity es- 
t imation error (Yang and Pedersen, 1997). 
In this experiment 6, we see that method B 
generates the smallest number of compound 
nouns (best efficiency) and our final propos- 
ing method H has the best recall and precision 
? (effectiveness) with the  reasonable number ? of 
compound nouns (efficiency). We can con- 
clude that the filtering method H is the best, 
considering the effectiveness and the efficiency 
at the same time. 
7 Conc lus ion  
In this paper, we presented a method to ex- 
tract the compound noun indexing rules au- 
tomatically from a large tagged corpus, and 
showed that this method can index compound 
nouns appearing in diverse types of docu- 
ments. 
In the view of effectiveness, this method is 
slightly better than the previous linguistic ap- 
proaches but requires no human effort. 
The proposed method also uses no parser 
and no rules described by humans, there- 
fore, it can be applied to unrestricted texts 
very robustly and has high domain porta-

guage Querying) demo system (located in

can be tested.

bility. We also presented a filtering method 
to solve the compound noun over-generation 
problem. Our proposed filtering method (H) 
shows good retrieval performance both in the 
view of the effectiveness and the efficiency. 
In the future, we need to perform some 
experiments on much larger commercial 
databases to test the practicality of our 
method. 
. Finally, our method doesn't  require lan- 
guage dependent knowledge, so it needs to be 
verified whether it can be easily applied to 
other languages.
