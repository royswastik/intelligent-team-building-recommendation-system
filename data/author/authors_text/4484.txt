Abstract
Given the restrictions on the subjects and
objects that any given verb may take, it seems
likely that children might learn verbs partly
by exploiting statistical regularities in co-
occurrences between verbs and noun phrases.
Pronouns are the most common NPs in the
speech that children hear. We demonstrate
that pronouns systematically partition several
important classes of verbs, and that a simple
statistical learner can exploit these
regularities to narrow the range of possible
verbs that are consistent with an incomplete
utterance. Taken together, these results
suggest that children might use regularities in
pronoun/verb co-occurrences to help learn
verbs, though whether this is actually so
remains a topic for further research.
1 Introduction
Pronouns stand for central elements of adult
conceptual schemes?as Quine pointed out,
pronouns ?are the basic media of reference?
(Quine, 1980, p. 13). In fact, most syntactic
subjects in spontaneous spoken adult discourse
are pronouns (Chafe, 1994), and English-speaking
mothers often begin with a high-frequency
pronoun when speaking to their children, with you
and I occurring most frequently (e.g., Valian,
1991). Parents use the inanimate pronoun it far
more frequently as the subject of an intransitive
sentence than of an transitive one (Cameron-
Faulkner et al, 2003, p. 860). As Cameron-
Faulkner et al note, this suggests that intransitive
sentences are used more often than transitives for
talking about inanimate objects. It also suggests,
we would note, that the use of the inanimate
pronoun might be a cue for the child as to whether
the verb is transitive or intransitive. Similarly,
Lieven and Pine (Lieven et al, 1997; Pine and
Lieven, 1993) have suggested that pronouns may
form the fixed element in lexically-specific
frames acquired by early language learners?so-
to-speak ?pronoun islands? something like
Tomasello?s (1992) ?verb islands.?
Many researchers have suggested that word-
word relations in general, and syntactic frames
specifically, are particularly important for
learning verbs (e.g., Gleitman, 1990; Gleitman
and Gillette, 1995). What has not been studied, to
our knowledge, is how pronouns specifically may
help children learn verbs by virtue of systematic
co-occurrences. We have begun to address this
issue in two steps. First, we measured the
statistical regularities among the uses of pronouns
and verbs in a large corpus of parent and child
speech. We found strong regularities in the use of
pronouns with several broad classes of verbs.
Second, using the corpus data, we trained a
connectionist network to guess which verb
belongs in a sentence given only the subject and
object, demonstrating that it is possible in
principle for a statistical learner to use the
regularities in parental speech to deduce
information about an unknown verb.
2 Experiment 1
The first experiment consisted of a corpus
analysis to identify patterns of co-occurrence
between pronouns and verbs in the child?s input.
2.1 Method
Parental utterances from the CHILDES
database (MacWhinney, 2000) were coded for
syntactic categories, then subjected to cluster
analysis. The mean age of target children
represented in the transcripts that were coded for
this experiment was 3;0 (SD1;2).
2.1.1 Materials
The following corpora were used: Bates, Bliss,
Bloom 1970, Brown, Clark, Cornell, Demetras
Working, Gleason, Hall, Higginson, Kuczaj,
MacWhinney, Morisset, New England, Post,
Sachs, Suppes, Tardiff, Valian, Van Houten, Van
Kleeck and Warren-Leubecker. Coding was
performed using a custom web application that
randomly selected transcripts, assigned them to
coders as they became available, collected coding
70
input, and stored it in a MySQL database. The
application occasionally assigned the same
transcript to all coders, in order to measure
reliability. Five undergraduate coders were trained
on the coding task and the use of the system.
2.1.2 Procedure
Each coder was presented, in sequence, with
each main tier line of each transcript she was
assigned, together with several lines of context;
the entire transcript was also available by clicking
a link on the coding page. For each line, she
indicated (a) whether the speaker was a parent,
target child, or other; (b) whether the addressee
was a parent, target child, or other; (c) the
syntactic frames of up to 3 clauses in the
utterance; (d) for each clause, up to 3 subjects,
auxiliaries, verbs, direct objects, indirect objects
and obliques. Because many utterances were
multi-clausal, the unit of analysis for assessing
pronoun-verb co-occurrences was the clause
rather than the utterance.
The syntactic frames were: no verb, question,
passive, copula, intransitive, transitive and
ditransitive. These were considered to be mutually
exclusive, i.e., each clause was tagged as
belonging to one and only one frame, according to
which of the following frames it matched first: (1)
The no verb frame included clauses ? such as
?Yes? or ?OK? ? with no main verb. (2) The
question  frame included any clause using a
question word ? such as ?Where did you go?? ? or
having inverted word order ? such as ?Did you go
to the bank?? ? but not merely a question mark ?
such as ?You went to the bank?? (3) The passive
frame included clauses in the passive voice, such
as ?John was hit by the ball.? (4) The copula
frame included clauses with the copula as the
main verb, such as ?John is angry.? (5) The
intransitive frame included clauses with no direct
object, such as ?John ran.? The transitive frame
included clauses with a direct object but no
indirect object, such as ?John hit the ball.? (6) The
ditransitive  frame included clauses with an
indirect object, such as ?John gave Mary a kiss.?
All nouns were coded in their singular forms,
whether they were singular or plural (e.g., ?boys?
was coded as ?boy?), and all verbs were coded in
their infinitive forms, whatever tense they were in
(e.g., ?ran? was coded as ?run?).
In total, 59,977 utterances were coded from 123
transcripts. All of the coders coded 7 of those
transcripts for the purpose of measuring
reliability. Average inter-coder reliability
(measured for each coder as the percentage of
items coded exactly the same way they were
coded by each other coder) was 86.1%. Given the
number of variables, the number of levels of each
variable (3 speakers, 3 addressees, 7 frames, and 6
syntactic relations), and the number of coders (5),
the probability of chance agreement is very low.
Although there are some substantive errors
(usually with complex embedded clauses or other
unusual constructions), many of the discrepancies
are simple spelling mistakes or failures to trim
words to their roots.
We only considered parental child-directed
speech (PCDS), defined as utterances where the
speaker was a parent and the addressee was a
target child. A total of 24,286 PCDS utterances
were coded, including a total of 28,733 clauses.
More than a quarter (28.36%) of the PCDS
clauses contained no verb at all; these were
excluded from further analysis. Clauses that were
questions (16.86%), passives (0.02%), and
copulas (11.86%) were also excluded from further
analysis. The analysis was conducted using only
clauses that were intransitives (17.24% of total
PCDS clauses), transitives (24.36%) or
ditransitives (1.48%), a total of 12,377 clauses.
2.2 Results
The most frequent nouns in the corpus?both
subjects and objects?are pronouns, as shown in
Figures 1 and 2. The objects divided the most
common verbs into three main classes: verbs that
take the pronoun it and concrete nouns as objects,
verbs that take complement clauses, and verbs
that take specific concrete nouns as objects. The
subjects divided the most common verbs into four
main classes: verbs whose subject is almost
always I, verbs whose subject is almost always
you, verbs that take I or you almost equally as
subject, and other verbs. The verbs divided the
most common object nouns into a number of
classes, including objects of telling and looking
verbs, objects of having and wanting verbs, and
objects of putting and getting verbs. The verbs
also divided the most common subject nouns into
a number of classes, including subjects of having
and wanting verbs, and subjects of thinking and
knowing verbs.

 Figure 2:  The 10 most frequent objects in PCDS
by their number of occurrences.
2.2.1 Verbs that take it as an object
The verbs that take it as their most common
object include verbs of motion and transfer, as
shown in Table 1.
2.2.2 Verbs that take complement clauses
Most verbs that did not take it as their most
common object instead took complement clauses.
These are primarily psychological verbs, as shown
in Table 2.
2.2.3 Verbs that take concrete nouns as objects
Most remaining verbs in the corpus took unique
sets of objects. For example, the most common
object used with read was book, followed by it
and story; the most common object used with play
was game, followed by it, block, and house.
2.2.4 Verbs that take I as a subject
Verbs whose most common subject is I include
bet (23 out of 23 uses with a subject, or 100%),
guess (21/22, 95.4%), think (212/263, 80.6%), and
see (95/207, 45.9%). Parents were not discussing
their gambling habits with their children ? bet was
being used to indicate the epistemic status of a
subsequent clause, as were the other verbs.
2.2.5 Verbs that take you as a subject
Verbs whose most common subject is you
include like (86 out of its 134 total uses with a
subject, or 64.2%), want (192/270, 71.1%), and
need (33/65, 50.8%). These verbs are being used
to indicate the deontic status of a subsequent
clause, including disposition or inclination,
volition, and compulsion.
2.2.6 Verbs that take you or I as a subject
Verbs that take I and you more or less equally
as subject include mean (15 out of 32 uses, or
46.9%, with I and 12 of 32 uses, or 37.5%, with
you), know  (I: 159/360, 44.2%; you: 189/360,
52.5%), and remember  (I: 9/23, 39.1%; you:
12/23, 52.2%).

The subject I appeared most frequently with the
verbs think and know.
2.3 Discussion
Although pronouns are semantically ?light,?
their particular referents determinable only from
context, they may nonetheless be potent forces on
early lexical learning by statistically pointing to
some classes of verbs as being more likely than
others. The results of Experiment 1 clearly show
that there are statistical regularities in the co-
occurrences of pronouns and verbs that the child
could use to discriminate classes of verbs.
Specifically, when followed by it, the verb is
likely to describe physical motion, transfer, or
possession. When followed a relatively complex
complement clause, by contrast, the verb is likely
to attribute a psychological state. Finer
distinctions may also be made with other objects,
including proper names and nouns. Verbs
followed by me, us, Daddy, and Mommy are likely
to have to do with telling or looking. Verbs
followed by one, stuff, them, him, or her are likely
to have to do with getting or putting. Verbs
followed by certain concrete objects such as
cookie, milk, or juice are likely to have to do with
having or wanting. Fine distinctions may also be
made according to subject. If the subject is I, the
verb is likely to have to do with thinking or
knowing, whereas if the subject is you, she, we,
he, or they, the verb is likely to have to do with
having or wanting. This regularity most likely
reflects the ecology of parents and
children?parents ?know? and children ?want? ?
but it could nonetheless be useful in
distinguishing these two classes of verbs.
The results thus far show that there are
potentially usable regularities in the statistical
relations between pronouns and verbs. However,
they do not show that these regularities can be
used to cue the associated words.
3 Experiment 2
To demonstrate that the regularities in pronoun-
verb co-occurrences in parental speech to children
can actually be exploited by a statistical learner,
we trained an autoassociator on the corpus data,
then tested it on incomplete utterances to see how
well it would ?fill in the blanks? when given only
a pronoun, or only a verb. An autoassociator is a
connectionist network that is trained to take each
input pattern and reproduce it at the output. In the
process, it compresses the pattern through a small
set of hidden units in the middle, forcing the
network to find the statistical regularities among
the elements in the input data. The network is
trained by backpropagation, which iteratively
reduces the discrepancies between the network?s
actual outputs and the target outputs (the same as
the inputs for an autoassociator).
In our case, the inputs (and thus the outputs) are
subject-verb-object ?sentences.? Once the
network has learned the regularities inherent in a
corpus of complete SVO sentences, testing it on
incomplete sentences (e.g., ?I ___ him?) allows us
to see what it has gleaned about the relationship
between the given parts (subject ?I? and object
?him? in our example) and the missing parts (the
verb in our example).
3.1 Method
3.1.1 Data
The network training data consisted of the
subject, verb, and object of all coded utterances
that contained the 50 most common subjects,
verbs and objects. There were 5,835 such
utterances. The inputs used a localist coding
wherein there was one and only one input unit out
of 50 activated for each subject, and likewise for
each verb and each object. Absent and omitted
arguments were counted among the 50, so, for
example, the utterance ?John runs? would have 3
units activated even though it only has 2
words?the third unit being the ?no object? unit.
With 50 units each for subject, verb and object,
there were a total of 150 input units to the
network. Active input units had a value of 1, and
inactive input units had a value of 0.
3.1.2 Network Architecture
The network consisted of a two-layer 150-8-150
unit autoassociator with a logistic activation
function at the hidden layer and a three separate
softmax activation functions (one each for the
subject, verb and object) at the output layer?see
73
Figure 3. Using the softmax activation function,
which ensures that all the outputs in the bank sum
to 1, together with the cross-entropy error
measure, allows us to interpret the network
outputs as probabilities (Bishop, 1995). The
network was trained by the resilient
backpropagation algorithm (Riedmiller and
Braun, 1993) to map its inputs back onto its
outputs. We chose to use eight units in the hidden
layer on the basis of some pilot experiments that
varied the number of hidden units. Networks with
fewer hidden units either did not learn the
problem sufficiently well or took a long time to
converge, whereas networks with more than about
8 hidden units learned quickly but tended to
overfit the data.
Figure 3:  Network architecture
3.1.3 Training
The data was randomly assigned to two groups:
90% of the data was used for training the network,
while 10% was reserved for validating the
network?s performance. Starting from different
random initial weights, five networks were trained
until the cross-entropy on the validation set
reached a minimum for each of them. Training
stopped after approximately 150 epochs of
training, on average. At that point, the networks
were achieving about 81% accuracy on correctly
identifying subjects, verbs and objects from the
training set. Near perfect accuracy on the training
set could have been achieved by further training,
with some loss of generalization, but we wanted
to avoid overfitting.
3.1.4 Testing
After training, the networks were tested with
incomplete inputs corresponding to isolated verbs
and pronouns. For example, to see what a network
had learned about it as a subject, it was tested with
a single input unit activated?the one
corresponding to it as subject. The other input
units were set to 0. Activations at the output units
were recorded. The results presented below report
average activations over all five networks.
3.2 Results
The networks learn many of the co-occurrence
regularities observed in the data. For example,
when tested on the object it (see Figure 4 on page
7 below), the most activated verbs are get, hold,
take  and have , which are among the most
common verbs associated with it in the input (see
Table 1). Similarly, tell, make  and say are the
most activated verbs when networks are tested
with the clause  unit activated in the object
position (figure not shown), and they are also
among the verbs most commonly associated with
a clause in the input (see Table 2).
However, the network does not merely learn the
relative frequencies of pronouns with verbs. For
example, the verbs most activated by the subject
you  are have  and get (see Figure 5 on page 8
below), neither of which appears in Table 3. The
reason for this, we believe, is that the subject you
is strongly associated with the object it (note the
strong activation of it in the right column of
Figure 5), and the object it, as mentioned in the
previous paragraph, is strongly associated with the
verbs h a v e  and get . The difference may be
observed most clearly when the network is
prompted simultaneously with you as the subject
and clause as the object (see Figure 6 on page 8
below). In that case, the verb want is strongly
preferred and, though get still takes second place,
t e l l  and k n o w  rank third and fourth,
respectively?consistent with the results in Table
1. This demonstrates that the network model is
sensitive to high-order correlations among words
in the input, not merely the first-order correlations
between pronoun and verb occurrences.
These results do not depend on using an
autoassociation network, and we do not claim that
children in fact use an autoassociation architecture
to learn language. Any statistical learner that is
able to discover higher-order correlations will
produce results similar to the ones shown here. An
autoassociator was chosen only as a simple means
of demonstrating in principle that a statistical
learner can extract the statistical regularities from
the data.
4 Conclusion
We have shown that there are statistical
regularities in co-occurrences between pronouns
and verbs in the speech that children hear from
their parents. We have also shown that a simple
statistical learner can learn these regularities,
including subtle higher-order regularities that are
not obvious in a casual glance at the input data,
and use them to predict the verb in an incomplete
sentence. How might this help children learn
74
verbs? In the first place, hearing a verb framed by
pronouns may help the child isolate the verb
itself?having simple, short consistent, and high-
frequency slot fillers could make it that much
easier to segment the relevant word in frames like
?He ___ it.? Second, the information provided by
the particular pronouns that are used in a given
utterance might help the child isolate the relevant
event or action from the blooming, buzzing
confusion around it?in English, pronouns can
indicate animacy, gender and number, and their
order can indicate temporal or causal direction or
sequence (e.g., ?You ___ it? versus ?It ___ you?).
Finally, if we suppose that the child has already
learned one verb and its pattern of correlations
with pronouns, and then hears another verb being
used with the same or a similar pattern of
correlations, the child may hypothesize that the
unknown verb is similar to the known verb. For
example, a child who understood ?want? but not
?need? might observe that ?you? is usually the
subject of both and conclude that ?want,? like
?need,? has to do with his desires and not, for
example, a physical motion or someone else?s
state of mind. The pronoun/verb co-occurrences in
the input may thus help the child narrow down the
class to which an unknown verb belongs, allowing
the learner to focus on further refining her grasp
of the verb through subsequent exposures.
Whether children are actually sensitive to these
regularities remains an open question. To the
extent that children have actually picked up on the
regularities, two predictions should follow. The
first is that children?s utterances should exhibit
roughly the same co-occurrence patterns as we
found in their parents? speech to them. Therefore,
the next step in our research is to determine
whether children are using pronouns and verbs
together with roughly the same frequencies that
they hear in their parents? speech. This is the
subject of research in progress using the coded
corpus data from Experiment 1. Because our
hypothesis concerns broad-class verb acquisition,
we are focusing on children younger than the age
of 3, by which time most children can produce the
most common verbs (Dale and Fenson, 1996).
The second prediction that follows from the
hypothesis that children might be sensitive to the
regularities demonstrated in this paper is that
children?s comprehension of ordinary verbs
should be better when they are used in frames that
are consistent with the regularities in the input
than when they are used in frames that are
inconsistent with those regularities. Assessing
whether this is true requires an experiment testing
children?s comprehension of real but relatively
infrequent verbs in two conditions: a ?consistent?
condition (in which the verb is used with nouns or
pronouns that are consistent with the regularities
in the corpus) and an ?inconsistent? condition (in
which the verb is used with nouns or pronouns
that are inconsistent with the regularities in the
corpus). This experiment is in the planning stages.
Even if children are sensitive to the regularities,
this knowledge might not help them learn new
verbs. That is, whether these regularities actually
play a role in language acquisition also remains an
open question. To the extent that they do, a third
prediction follows: children should be better able
to generalize comprehension of novel verbs when
they are presented in frames consistent with these
regularities. We are designing an experiment to
test this hypothesis.
The argument that the frequency of pronouns
and their co-occurrences with verb classes play a
role in the acquisition of verbs could be
strengthened by showing that it is true in many
languages. The present study considered only
English, which is a relatively noun-heavy
language in which argument ellipsis is rare. Some
other languages, by contrast, tend to emphasize
verbs and frequently drop nominal arguments. We
are especially keen to find out what sorts of cues
children might be using to identify verb classes in
such languages. Hence, work is underway to
collect comparable data from Japanese and Tamil,
verb-heavy languages with frequent argument
dropping and case-marked pronouns reflecting
various degrees of social status.

Figure 4: Average network output response to the object it. Subjects are shown in the left column, verbs in
the middle, and objects on the right. Within each syntactic category, output units are ordered according to the
frequency of the corresponding words in the input (lower numbers are higher frequency). The width of each
bar reflects the average activation of the corresponding unit in our networks.
