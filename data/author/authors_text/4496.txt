 Abstract  
This paper gives an overview of the 
Caderige project. This project involves 
teams from different areas (biology, 
machine learning, natural language 
processing) in order to develop high-
level analysis tools for extracting 
structured information from biological 
bibliographical databases, especially 
Medline. The paper gives an overview 
of the approach and compares it to the 
state of the art.  
1 Introduction 
Developments in biology and biomedicine are 
reported in large bibliographical databases 
either focused on a specific species (e.g. 
Flybase, specialized on Drosophilia 
Menogaster) or not (e.g. Medline). This type 
of  information sources is crucial for biologists 
but there is a lack of tools to explore them and 
extract relevant information. While recent 
named entity recognition tools have gained a 
certain success on these domains, event-based 
Information Extraction (IE) is still a challenge.  
The Caderige project aims at designing and 
integrating Natural Language Processing 
(NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques 
to explore, analyze and extract targeted 
information in biological textual databases. We 
promote a corpus-based approach focusing on 
text pre-analysis and normalization: it is 
intended to drain out the linguistic variation 
dimension, as most as possible. Actually, the 
MUC (1995) conferences have demonstrated 
that extraction is more efficient when 
performed on normalized texts. The extraction 
patterns are thus easier to acquire or learn, 
more abstract and easier to maintain 
Beyond extraction patterns, it is also possible 
to acquire from the corpus, via ML methods, a 
part of the knowledge necessary for text 
normalization as shown here.  
This paper gives an overview of current 
research activities and achievements of the 
Caderige project. The paper first presents our 
approach and compares it with the one 
developed in the framework of a similar 
project called Genia (Collier et al 1999). We 
then propose an account of Caderige 
techniques on various filtering and 
normalization tasks, namely, sentence filtering, 
resolution of named entity synonymy, 
syntactic parsing, and ontology learning. 
Finally, we show how extraction patterns can 
be learned from normalized and annotated 
documents, all applied to biological texts.  
2 Description of our approach 
In this section, we give some details about the 
motivations and choices of implementation. 
We then briefly compare our approach with the 
one of the Genia project.

2.1 Project organization 
The Caderige project is a multi disciplinary 
French research project on the automatic 
mining of textual data from the biomedical 
domain and is mainly exploratory orientated. It 
involved biology teams (INRA), computer 
science teams (LIPN, INRA and Leibniz-
IMAG) and NLP teams (LIPN) as major 
partners, plus LRI and INRIA from 2000 to 
2003. 
2.2 Project motivations 
Biologists can search bibliographic databases 
via the Internet, using keyword queries that 
retrieve a large superset of relevant papers. 
Alternatively, they can navigate through 
hyperlinks between genome databanks and 
referenced papers. To extract the requisite 
knowledge from the retrieved papers, they 
must identify the relevant abstracts or 
paragraphs. Such manual processing is time 
consuming and repetitive, because of the 
bibliography size, the relevant data sparseness, 
and the database continuous updating. From 
the Medline database, the focused query 
?Bacillus subtilis and transcription? which 
returned 2,209 abstracts in 2002, retrieves 
2,693 of them today. We chose this example 
because Bacillus subtilis is a model bacterium 
and transcription is a central phenomenon in 
functional genomics involved in genic 
interaction, a popular IE problem. 
GerE stimulates cotD transcription and 
inhibits cotA transcription in vitro by 
sigma K RNA polymerase, as expected from 
in vivo studies, and, unexpectedly, 
profoundly inhibits in vitro 
transcription of the gene (sigK) that 
encode sigma K.

Once relevant abstracts have been retrieved, 
templates should be filled by hand since there 
is no available IE tool operational in genomics  
Type: positive 
Agent: GerE

Target: transcription of the 
gene sigK 
Figure 2: A template describing a genic 
interaction. 
Still, applying IE ? la MUC to genomics and 
more generally to biology is not an easy task 
because IE systems require deep analysis 
methods to locate relevant fragments. As 
shown in the example in Figures 1 and 2, 
retrieving that GerE is the agent of the 
inhibition of the transcription of the gene sigK 
requires at least syntactic dependency analysis 
and coordination processing. In most of the 
genomics IE tasks (function, localization, 
homology) the methods should then combine 
the semantic-conceptual analysis of text 
understanding methods with IE through pattern 
matching. 
2.3 Comparison with the Genia project 
Our approach is very close to the one of the 
Genia project (Collier et al, 1999). Both 
projects rely on precise high-level linguistic 
analysis to be able to perform IE. The kind of 
information being searched is similar, 
concerning mainly gene and protein interaction 
as most of the research in this domain. The 
Genia corpus (Ohtae et al 2001) is not 
specialized on a specific species whereas ours 
is based on Bacillus Subtilis.  
Both projects develop annotation tools and 
Document Type Definition (DTD), which are, 
for the most part, compatible. The aim here is 
to build training corpus to which various 
techniques of NLP and ML are applied in 
order to acquire efficient event-based 
extraction patterns. The choice of ML and 
NLP methods differs but their aim is similar to 
our: normalizing text with predicate-arguments 
structures for learning better patterns. For 
example, Genia uses a combination of parsers 
to finally perform an HPSG-like analysis. The 
Caderige syntactic analysis is based on the 
specialization of the Link Parser (Sleator and 
Temperley, 1993 see section 4) to the 
biological domain.  
 In the following two sections, we detail our 
text filtering and normalization methods. 
Filtering aims at pruning the irrelevant part of 
the corpus while normalization aims at 
building an abstract representation of the 
relevant text. Section 4 is devoted to the 
acquisition of extraction patterns from the 
filtered and normalized text. 
3 Text filtering 
IR and text filtering are a prerequisite step to 
IE, as IE methods (including normalization and 
learning) cannot be applied to large and 
irrelevant corpora (they are not robust enough 
and they are computationally expensive). IR 
here is done through Medline interface by 
keyword queries for filtering the appropriate 
44
document subset. Then, text filtering, reduces 
the variability of textual data with the 
following assumptions: 
? desired information is local to sentences ; 
? relevant sentences contain at least two gene 
names. 
These hypotheses may lead to miss some genic 
interactions, but we assume that information 
redundancy is such that at least one instance of 
each interaction is contained into a single 
sentence in the corpus. The documents 
retrieved are thus segmented into sentences 
and the sentences with at least two gene names 
are selected. 
To identify the only relevant sentences among 
thoses,  classical supervised ML methods have 
been applied to a Bacillus Subtilis corpus in 
which relevant and irrelevant sentences had 
been annotated by a biological expert. Among 
SVMs, Na?ve Bayes (NB) methods, Neural 
Networks, decision trees (Marcotte et al, 
2001;  Nedellec et al, 2001), (Nedellec et al 
2001) demonstrates that  simple NB methods 
coupled with feature selection seem to perform 
well by yielding around 85 % precision and 
recall. Moreover, our first experiments show 
that the linguistic-based representation changes 
such as the use of lemmatization, terminology 
and named entities, do not lead to significant 
improvements. The relevant sentences filtered 
at this step are then used as input of the next 
tasks, normalization and IE. 
4 Normalization 
This section briefly presents three text 
normalization tasks: normalization of entity 
names, normalization of relations between text 
elements through syntactic dependency parsing 
and semantic labeling. The normalization 
process, by providing an abstract 
representation of the sentences, allows the 
identification of regularities that simplify the 
acquisition or learning of pattern rules. 
4.1 Entity names normalization 
Named Entity recognition is a critical point in 
biological text analysis, and a lot of work was 
previously done to detect gene names in text 
(Proux and al., 1998), (Fukuda and al., 1998). 
So, in Caderige, we do not develop any 
original NE extraction tool. We focus on a less 
studied problem that is synonyms recognition.  
Beyond typographical variations and 
abbreviations, biological entities often have 
several different names. Synonymy of gene 
names is a well-known problem, partly due to 
the huge amount of data manipulated (43.238 
references registered in Flybase for 
Drosophilia Melanogaster for example). Genes 
are often given a temporary name by a 
biologist. This name is then changed according 
to information on the concerned gene: for 
example SYGP-ORF50 is a gene name 
temporarily attributed by a sequencing project 
to the PMD1 yeast gene. We have shown that, 
in addition to available data in genomic 
database (GenBank, SwissProt,?), it is 
possible to acquire many synonymy relations 
with good precision through text analysis. By 
focusing on synonymy trigger phrases such as 
"also called" or "formerly", we can extract text 
fragments of that type :  gene trigger gene. 
However, the triggers themselves are subject to 
variation and the arguments of the synonymy 
relation must be precisely identified. We have 
shown that it is possible to define patterns to 
recognize synonymy expressions. These 
patterns have been trained on a representative 
set of sentences from Medline and then tested 
on a new corpus made of 106 sentences 
containing the keyword formerly. Results on 
the test corpus are the following: 97.5% 
precision, 75% recall. We chose to have a high 
precision since the acquired information must 
be valid for further acquisition steps 
(Weissenbacher, 2004).  
The approach that has been developed is very 
modular since abstract patterns like gene 
trigger gene (the trigger being a linguistic 
marker or a simple punctuation) can be 
instantiated by various linguistic items. A 
score can be computed for each instantiation of 
the pattern, during a learning phase on a large 
representative corpus. The use of a reduced 
tagged corpus and of a large untagged corpus 
justify the use of semi-supervised learning 
techniques.  
4.2  Sentence parsing 
The extraction of structured information from 
texts requires precise sentence parsing tools 
that exhibit relevant relation between domain 
entities. Contrary to (Akane et al 2001), we 
chose a partial parsing approach: the analysis 
is focused on relevant parts of texts and, from 
these chunks, on specific relations. Several 
reasons motivate this choice: among others, the 
fact that relevant information generally appears 
in predefined syntactic patterns and, moreover, 
45
the fact that we want to learn domain 
knowledge ontologies from specific syntactic 
relations (Faure and Nedellec, 2000 ; Bisson et 
al. 2000). 
First experiments have been done on several 
shallow parsers. It appeared that constituent 
based parsers are efficient to segment the text 
in syntactic phrases but fail to extract relevant 
functional relationships betweens phrases. 
Dependency grammars are more adequate 
since they try to establish links between heads 
of syntactic phrases. In addition, as described 
in Schneider (1998), dependency grammars are 
looser on word order, which is an advantage 
when working on  a domain specific language.  
Two dependency-based syntactic parsers have 
been tested (Aubin 2003): a hybrid commercial 
parser (henceforth HCP) that combines 
constituent and dependency analysis, and a 
pure dependency analyzer: the Link Parser.   
Prasad and Sarkar (2000) promote a twofold 
evaluation for parsers: on the one hand the use 
of a representative corpus and, on the other 
hand, the use of specific manually elaborated 
sentences. The idea is to evaluate analyzers on 
real data (corpus evaluation) and then to check 
the performance on specific syntactic 
phenomena. In this experiment, we chose to 
have only one corpus, made of sentences 
selected from the Medline corpus depending 
on their syntactic particularity. This strategy 
ensures representative results on real data. 
A set of syntactic relations was then selected 
and manually evaluated. This led to the results 
presented for major relations only in table 1. 
For each analyzer and relation, we compute a 
recall and precision score (recall = # relevant 
found relations / # relations to be found; 
precision = # relevant found relations / # 
relations found by the system).  
The Link Parser generally obtains better results 
than HCP. One reason is that a major 
particularity of our corpus (Medline abstracts) 
is that sentences are often (very) long (27 
words on average) and contain several clauses. 
The dependency analyzer is more accurate to 
identify relevant relationships between 
headwords whereas the constituent parser is 
lost in the sentence complexity. We finally 
opted for the Link Parser. Another advantage 
of the Link Parser is the possibility to modify 
its set of rules (see next subsection). The Link 
parser is currently used in INRA to extract 
syntactic relationships from texts in order to 
learn domain ontologies on the basis of a 
distributional analysis (Harris 1951, Faure and 
N?dellec, 1999).  
4.3 Recycling a general parser for biology 
During the evaluation tests, we noticed that 
some changes had to be applied either to the 
parser or to the text itself to improve the 
syntactic analysis of our biomedical corpus. 
The corpus needs to be preprocessed: sentence 
segmentation, named entities and terms 
recognition are thus performed using generic 
modules tuned for the biology domain
1
. Term 
recognition allows the removing of numerous 
structure ambiguities, which clearly benefits 
the parsing quality and execution time.

 A term analyser is currently being built at LIPN 
using existing term resources like Gene Ontology 
(see Hamon and Aubin, 2004).

46
Concerning the Link Parser, we have manually 
introduced new rules and lexicon to allow the 
parsing of syntactic structures specific to the 
domain. For instance, the Latin-derived Noun 
Adjective phrase "Bacillus subtilis" has a 
structure inverse to the canonical English noun 
phrase (Adjective Noun). Another major task 
was to loosen the rules constraints because 
Medline abstracts are written by biologists 
who express themselves in sometimes broken 
English. A typical error is the omission of the 
determinant before some nouns that require 
one. We finally added words unknown to the 
original parser. 
4.4 Semantic labelling 
Asium software is used to semi-automatically 
acquire relevant semantic categories by 
distributional semantic analysis of parsed 
corpus. These categories contribute to text 
normalization at two levels, disambiguating 
syntactic parsing and typing entities and 
actions for IE. Asium is based on an original 
ascendant hierarchical clustering method that 
builds a hierarchy of semantic classes from the 
syntactic dependencies parsed in the training 
corpus. Manual validation is required in order 
to distinguish between different meanings 
expressed by identical syntactic structures. 
5 Extraction pattern learning 
Extraction pattern learning requires a training 
corpus from which the relevant and 
discriminant regularities can be automatically 
identified. This relies on two processes: text 
normalization that is domain-oriented but not 
task-oriented (as described in previous 
sections), and task-oriented annotation by the 
expert of the task.  
5.1 Annotation procedure 
The Caderige annotation language is based on 
XML and a specific DTD (Document Type 
Definition that can be used to annotate both 
prokaryote and eukaryote organisms by 50 
tags with up to 8 attributes. Such a precision is 
required for learning feasibility and extraction 
efficiency. Practically, each annotation aims at 
highlighting the set of words in the sentence 
describing: 
? Agents (A): the entities activating or 
controlling the interaction 
? Targets (T): the entities that are produced 
or controlled 
? Interaction (I): the kind of control 
performed during the interaction 
? Confidence (C): the confidence level in this 
interaction. 
The annotation of ?A low level of GerE 
activated transcription of CotD by GerE RNA 
polymerase in vitro ...? is given below. The 
attributes associated to the tag <GENIC-
INTERACTION> express the fact that the 
interaction is a transcriptional activation and 
that it is certain. The other tags (<IF>, 
<AF1>, ?) mark  the agent (AF1 and AF2), the 
target (TF1) and the interaction (IF).

   <CF>but<C>in vitro</C></CF> 
</GENIC-INTERACTION> 
5.2 The annotation editor2 
Annotations cannot be processed in text form 
by biologists. The annotation framework 
developed by Caderige provide a general XML 
editor with a graphic interface for creating, 
checking and revising annotated documents. 
For instance, it displays the text with graphic 
attributes as defined in the editor XML style 
sheet, it allows to add the tags without strong 
constraint on the insertion order and it 
automatically performs some checking. 
The editor interface is composed of four main 
parts (see Figure 3). The editable text zone for 
annotation, the list of XML tags that can be 
used at a given time, the attributes zone to edit 
the values of the selected tag, and the XML

use this annotation tool in a research project 
47
code currently generated. In the text zone, the 
above sentence is displayed as follows: 
A low level of GerE activated 
transcription of CotD by GerE RNA 
polymerase but in vitro 
This editor is currently used by some of the 
Caderige project partners and at SIB (Swiss 
Institute of BioInformatics) with another DTD, 
in the framework of the European BioMint 
project. Several corpora on various species 
have been annotated using this tool, mainly by 
biologists from INRA.  
5.3 Learning 
The vast majority of approaches relies on 
hand-written pattern rules that are based on 
shallow representations of the sentences (e.g. 
Ono et al, 2001). In Caderige, the deep 
analysis methods increase the complexity of 
the sentence representation, and thus of the IE 
patterns. ML techniques appear therefore very 
appealing to automate the process of rule 
acquisition (Freitag, 1998; Califf et al, 1998; 
Craven et al, 1999).  
Learning IE rules is seen as a discrimination  
task, where the concept to learn is a n-ary 
relation between arguments which correspond 
to the template fields. For example, the 
template in figure 2 can be filled by learning a 
ternary relation genic-interaction(X,Y,Z), 
where X,Y and Z are the type, the agent and 
the target of the interaction. The learning 
algorithm is provided with a set of positive and 
negative examples built from the sentences 
annotated and normalized. We use the 
relational learning algorithm, Propal (Alphonse 
et al, 2000). The appeal of using a relational 
method for this task is that it can naturally 
represent the relational structure of the 
syntactic dependencies in the normalized 
sentences and the background knowledge if 
needed, such as for instance semantic relations.  
For instance, the IE rules learned by Propal 
extract, from the following sentence :"In this 
mutant, expression of the spoIIG gene, whose 
transcription depends on both sigA and the 
phosphorylated Spo0A protein, Spo0AP, a 
major transcription factor during early stages 
of sporulation, was greatly reduced at 43 
degrees C.", successfully extract the two 
relations genic-interaction(positive, sigA, 
spoIIG) and genic-interaction(positive, 
Spo0AP, spoIIG). As preliminary experiments, 
we selected a subset of sentences as learning 
dataset, similar to this one. The performance of 
the learner evaluated by ten-fold cross-
validation is 69?6.5% of recall and 86?3.2% 
of precision. This result is encouraging, 
showing that the normalization process 
provides a good representation for learning IE 
rules with both high recall and high precision. 
6 Conclusion 
We have presented in this paper some results 
from the Caderige project. Two major issues 
are the development of a specific annotation 
editor for domain specialists and a set of 
machine learning and linguistic processing 
tools tuned for the biomedical domain.  
Current developments focus on the use of 
learning methods in the extraction process. 
These methods are introduced at different 
levels in the system architecture. A first use is 
Figure 3: the Caderige annotation editor 
48
the acquisition of domain knowledge to 
enhance the extraction phase. A second use 
concerns a dynamic adaptation of existing 
modules during the analysis according to 
specific features in a text or to specific text 
genres.
