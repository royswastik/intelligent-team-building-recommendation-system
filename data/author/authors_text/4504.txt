Abstract 
Chinese abbreviations are widely used in 
the modern Chinese texts. They are a 
special form of unknown words, including 
many named entities. This results in 
difficulty for correct Chinese processing. 
In this study, the Chinese abbreviation 
problem is regarded as an error recovery 
problem in which the suspect root words 
are the ?errors? to be recovered from a set 
of candidates. Such a problem is mapped
to an HMM-based generation model for 
both abbreviation identification and root
word recovery, and is integrated as part of
a unified word segmentation model when 
the input extends to a complete sentence. 
Two major experiments are conducted to 
test the abbreviation models. In the first 
experiment, an attempt is made to guess 
the abbreviations of the root words. An 
accuracy rate of 72% is observed. In 
contrast, a second experiment is 
conducted to guess the root words from 
abbreviations. Some submodels could 
achieve as high as 51% accuracy with the 
simple HMM-based model. Some 
quantitative observations against heuristic 
abbreviation knowledge about Chinese 
are also observed. 
1 Introduction 
The modern Chinese language is a highly

abbreviated one due to the mixed uses of ancient 
single character words as well as modern 
multi-character words and compound words. The 
abbreviated form and root form are used 
interchangeably everywhere in the current Chinese 
articles. Some news articles may contain about 
20% of sentences that have suspect abbreviated 
words in them ?Lai 2003?. Since abbreviations 
cannot be enumerated in a dictionary, it forms a 
special class of unknown words, many of which 
originate from named entities. Many other open
class words are also abbreviatable. This particular 
class thus introduces complication for Chinese
language processing, including the fundamental 
word segmentation process ?Chiang 1992, Lin
1993, Chang 1997? and many word-based 
applications. For instance, a keyword-based 
information retrieval system may requires the two 
forms, such as ?
? and ?
? 
??legislators??, in order not to miss any relevant 
documents. The Chinese word segmentation 
process is also significantly degraded by the 
existence of unknown words ?Chiang 1992?, 
including unknown abbreviations. 
There are many heuristics for Chinese
abbreviations. Such heuristics, however, can easily 
break ?Sproat 2002?. Currently, only some
quantitative approaches ?Huang 1994a, 94b? are 
available in predicting the presentation of an 
abbreviation. Since such formulations regard the 
word segmentation process and abbreviation 
identification as two independent processes, they
probably cannot optimize the identification 
process jointly with the word segmentation process, 
and thus may lose the useful contextual 
information. Some class-based segmentation 
models ?Sun 2002, Gao 2003? well integrate the 
identification of some regular non-lexicalized units 
?such as named entities?. However, the 
abbreviation process can be applied to almost all 
word forms ?or classes of words?. Therefore, this
particular word formation process may have to be 
handled as a separate layer in the segmentation 
process. 
To resolve the Chinese abbreviation problems 
25 Apr 2007  03:09Generated by HTML_ToPDF at rustyparts.com - 2 -
shinA Preliminary Study on Probabilistic Models for Chinese Abbreviations
and integrate its identification into the word
segmentation process, this study proposes to 
regard the abbreviation problem in the word
segmentation process as an ?error recovery? 
problem in which the suspect root words are the 
?errors? to be recovered from a set of candidates 
according to some generation probability criteria. 
This idea implies that an HMM-based model for 
identifying Chinese abbreviations could be 
effective in either identifying the existence of an 
abbreviation or the recovery of the root words 
Page 2
from an abbreviation. We therefore start with a 
unified word segmentation model so that both 
processes can be handled at the same time, and 
when the input is reduced to a single abbreviated 
word, the model can be equally useful for 
recovering its root. 
As a side effect of using HMM-based
formulation, we expect that a large abbreviation 
dictionary could be derived from a large corpus or 
from web documents through the training process 
of the unified word segmentation model 
automatically. 
Section 2 will show our HMM models and the 
three abbreviation problems correspond to the 
three basic HMM problems. Section 3 will show 
the experiment setup. Section 4 will examine the 
experiments to guess abbreviations from root or 
vice versa. 
2 Chinese Abbreviation Models
2.1 An Error Recovery Paradigm 
To resolve the abbreviation problems, first note 
that the most common action one would take when 
encountering an abbreviation is to find its 
candidate roots ?probably from a large 
abbreviation dictionary if available or from an 
ordinary dictionary with some educated guesses?, 
and then identify the most probable one. This 
process is identical to the operation of many 
spelling correction models, which generate the
candidate corrections according to a reversed word 
formation process, then justify the best candidate.

shinA Preliminary Study on Probabilistic Models for Chinese Abbreviations
Such an analogy indicates that we may use an 
HMM model ?Rabiner 1993?, which is good at 
finding the best unseen state sequence, for error 
recovery. There will be a direct map between the 
two paradigms if we regard the observed input 
character sequence as our ?observation sequence?, 
and regard the unseen word candidates as the 
underlying ?state sequence?. 
Given these mappings, we will be able to use 
many standard processing approaches for HMM 
when we have to answer some interesting 
questions ?including root word recovery?. Among 
all interesting questions for an HMM, we have 
three basic questions to ask the model ?Rabiner 
1993?, namely the output probability of an output 
sequence, the best underlying state sequence and 
the best parameters given a training corpus. 
If we can ask the HMM for abbreviation the 
same questions, then we will also be able to 
answer the question on ?1? what is the likelihood 
that a string is an abbreviation, ?2? what are the 
best underlying root words for an input character
string that contains abbreviations, and ?3? how to 
estimate the model parameters automatically given 
a corpus. 
The first question is related to the problem of 
generating an appropriate abbreviation from a root 
word; the second question is linked to finding the
best underlying roots from an abbreviated string, 
and the third question have a direct link to the 
construction of an abbreviation dictionary 
automatically from a corpus. For now we will not 
explore this third question, but leave it to a
research that would be launched in the near future. 
The most interesting question to ask is, of 
course, the second question in the Chinese 
tokenization process. Therefore, we will start with 
a unified word segmentation model, which has the 
capability to handle abbreviation problem jointly 
with the word segmentation process. 
2.2 HMM-Q2: Unified Word Segmentation 
Model for Abbreviation Recovery 
To integrate the abbreviation process into the word
segmentation model, firstly we can regard the 
segmentation model as finding the best underlying

assumes that the generation of an abbreviation is

a word-based bigram model. Such assumptions 
can be adapted to different submodels for word 
segmentation ?Chiang 1992? as appropriate. 
Furthermore, in many cases, the underlying word
i
w
will be a compound word consisting of other 
constituent words

since the constituents may be abbreviated

differently in different context, making the
mapping of the compound ambiguous. For 
instance, some people may prefer to abbreviate ?
? ?Industrial Technology Research 
Institute; ITRI? into ?
? ?IRI? while other 
may prefer an abbreviation of ?
? ?ITI?.

formulation for an HMM ?Hidden Markov Model?

Such an analogy with an HMM enables us to 
estimate the model parameters using an 
unsupervised training method that is directly 
ported 
from 
the 
forward-backward 
or 
Baum-Welch re-estimation formula ?Rabiner 1993? 
or a generic EM algorithm ?Dempster 1977?. 
Note also that, while the above formulation is 
intended for finding root words in a sentence, with
the help of contextual words, we can also apply the 
same formulation to a single abbreviated word 
?likely to have a compound word as its root in 
many cases? to find the most likely constituent 
words, without the help of surrounding words, but 
with the help of contextual constraints among its 
constituents. 
2.2.1. Language Model 
The word transition probability

P
used in the language model is used to provide 
contextual constraints among root words. It may 
not be reliably estimated when the language has a 
large vocabulary and when the training corpus is 
small. To resolve this problem, we can back-off 
the bigram word transition probability to a 
unigram word probability using Katz?s method 
?Katz 1987? for rare bigrams. We can, of course, 
use other smoothing methods to acquire reliable 
parameters. The smoothing issues, however, are 
not the main focus of this preliminary study. 
2.2.2 Generation Model for Abbreviations 
In the perfect case where all words are 
lexicalized, rendering all surface forms identical to 
their ?root? forms and all words are known to the 
system dictionary, we will have

we can no longer ignore the generation probability

i

is ?
? then 
i

could 
be the compound word ?
? ?Taiwan

? ?Taiwan Major

likely ?

above two compounds is the root form of the 
abbreviation. Therefore, we need a method for 
estimating the probabilities between the 
abbreviations and their root forms ?many of which
are compound words with other constituents?. 
2.3 Applying Abbreviation Models 
There are two problems to use the unified model 
which takes abbreviated words into account. First 
of all, since the word lattice is constructed from all 
possible

randomly combine all possible root forms, which 
is not affordable in computational cost. Therefore, 
we have to make some smarter choices. Second,

once 
the lattice is constructed with candidate root

2.3.1 Candidate Root Word Generation 
The first problem can be resolved if we choose 
some highly probable constituents 
w
that would 
generate each individual characters

c
in 
i
c
independently, and allow such Top-N candidates 
to form part of the complete word lattice. That is, 
Page 4
for each individual character

, we choose its 
Top-N candidates according to:

. 
The probability

|
ij
P c w
here represents the 
character-wise generation probability of a single 
character from its corresponding root word. Notice 
that, after we apply the word segmentation model 
Equation 1 to the word lattice, some of the above
candidates may be preferred and others be 
discarded, by consulting the neighboring words 
and their transition probabilities. This makes the 
abbreviation model jointly optimized in the word 
segmentation process, instead of being optimized 
independent of context.

Equation 2. Abbreviation Probability. 
In other words, we use the transition 
probability between constituent words and the 
character-wise 
generation 
probabilities 
of 
individual characters from a constituent word to 
estimate the global generation probability of the 
abbreviated form. 
2.3.3 Simplified Abbreviation Models 
It is sometimes simply not efficient to save all 
pairs of root compounds and their respective 
abbreviations in an abbreviation dictionary. 
Therefore, it is desirable to simplify the
abbreviation probability by using some simpler 
features for Chinese abbreviation words. For 
instance, it is known that many 4-character 
compound words will be abbreviated as 
2-character abbreviations ?such as the case for the 
<
, 
> pair.? It was also known 
heuristically that many such 4-character words are 
abbreviated by reserving the first and the third 
characters, which can be represented by a ?1010? 
bit pattern, where a ?1? means to reserve the
respective character and a ?0? means to delete it. 
Therefore, a reasonable simplification for the 
abbreviation model is to introduce the length and 
the bit pattern for abbreviation operations as 
additional features into the abbreviation model. If 
this is the case, we will have the following 
augmented abbreviation model.

product of the per-character generation 
probabilities and the sub-constituent transition 
probabilities as outlined in Equation 2. This term 
can of course be ignored from the above 
augmented abbreviation model so that only very
simple length and position features are used for 
abbreviation handling. 
3 Data and Parameter Estimation 
An abbreviation dictionary containing the
word-abbreviation pairs is required to test the 
proposed models. Unfortunately, a large Chinese
abbreviation dictionary is not available. Therefore, 
we have to collect some of the generic 
abbreviations, and make others manually from 
some named entity lists. Almost half of our 
collection comes from the Ministry of Education 
of the ROC. ?http://www.edu.tw/clc/dict/?. ?In a 
future plan, a large abbreviation dictionary will be
built automatically by using the proposed models.? 
Eventually, we got 1547 root-abbreviation pairs. 
Among them, 1235 pairs are considered simple
and 312 pairs are ?tough? in the sense that they 
violate some model assumptions. For instance, we 
required that a root in a compound word be 
mapped to at least one character in its abbreviation 
?not to a null string?, and we also assume that the 
word cannot be mapped to a character that is not
part of the word. ?For example, AB can be 
abbreviated as A or B but not C.? Some tough 
words will actually map substrings to null strings; 
Page 5
others may be recursively abbreviated; and yet 
others may change the word order ?as in 
abbreviating ?
? as ?
? 
25 Apr 2007  03:09Generated by HTML_ToPDF at rustyparts.com - 18 -
shinA Preliminary Study on Probabilistic Models for Chinese Abbreviations
instead of ?
?.?. As a result, the tough pairs 
will not be handled correctly with current models. 
To simplify the task, only the 1235 simple pairs 
are tested for evaluation. They are further divided 
randomly into a training set of 986 pairs ?80%? 
and a test set of 249 pairs ?20%?. Since the corpus
size is not large, the compound words are also 
manually segmented into their constituents in
order to know the true alignments between each 
character of the abbreviation with its root form in 
the compound word. Admittedly, such an 
extremely small training set causes serious data
sparseness problem during training. Therefore, the 
evaluated performance in this preliminary report
will be highly underestimated. 
The parameters are estimated in the 
unsupervised mode using a standard EM algorithm 
or the re-estimation method as conventional HMM 
models would do ?Rabiner 1993?. In addition, the 
manually segmented dictionary also allows us to 
estimate the model parameters in the supervised
mode. 
The unsupervised training will automatically 
align each character in the abbreviations to its root 
form in the full words. It is observed that 65.5% of 
the training set dictionary pairs will be aligned 
correctly. Other pairs are aligned partially correct. 
Note that parameters

and

can be estimated using maximum likelihood 
estimation by directly consulting the abbreviation 
dictionary since they are only related to word 
length and character position. It is interesting, in 
the first place, to check these types of parameters

Table 2. High Frequency Abbreviation Patterns 
[by P?bit|n?] 
Table 1 shows how word lengths will change 
during the abbreviation process, and Table 2
shows which characters will be deleted from the 
root of a particular length. The tables
quantitatively support some general heuristics for 
native Chinese speaker. For instance, most words 
will be abbreviated by deleting about half the 
characters in the words, as shown in Table 1. The 
data also shows that the first character in a 
two-character word will be retained in most cases, 
and the first and the third characters in a 
4-character word will be retained in 56% of the 
cases. However, the tables also shows that around 
50% of the cases cannot be uniquely determined 
simply by consulting the word length for its
abbreviated form. This does suggest the necessity
of an abbreviation model for resolving this kind of
unknown words and named entities. 
4 Experiments and Analysis 
The unified model can be applied to a whole 
sentence which contains abbreviations during
word segmentation. When the input is reduced to a 
single abbreviated word ?or compound?, it can also 
be applied to recover the underlying root 
constituent words ?without consulting contextual 
words?. In this paper, we will only focus on the 
abbreviation word recovery problems. 
Two major experiments are conducted. The 
first experiment is to guess the most likely 
abbreviation form for a word using various feature 
combinations; the second is to guess the root word 
Page 6
from an abbreviation. The following sections will 
give more details. 
4.1 Guessing Abbreviations from Roots

most probable abbreviation forms for the
unabbreviated words in a word list. The

abbreviation forms of a word can be enumerated 
by arbitrarily retaining some characters of this root 
word and deleting others. For example, the word 
?
@? has six possible abbreviated forms: ? ?, 
? ?, ?@?, ?
?, ? @? and ? @?. In general, 
if we have a root word of length L, there could be

shinA Preliminary Study on Probabilistic Models for Chinese Abbreviations
i
i
P c w
is the generation probability for a 
known alignment A, which can be estimated as in 
Equation 2. 
For simplicity, we assume that each character 
in 
i
c
will be mapped to a substring 
i j
w
in 
i
w
. 
In other words, we assume that the mapping 
between the constituents is 1-1, and no 1-0 or 0-1 
mapping is possible. ?In future works, such a 
constraint could be removed.? Also, we will 
assume that 
i j
w
should at least contain the 
character that is aligned to it. ?This is not always 
true for Chinese abbreviations. For example, ?
? can be abbreviated with its ancient location 
name ? ?, which does not appear anywhere in its 
root.? 
There is also a normalization issue in 
computing the probability of a particular alignment. 
In general, a shorter string may be preferred as the 
best abbreviation simply because it multiplies less
probability factors when estimating the alignment
probability. To reduce this effect, we intentionally 
scale down, by a normalization factor, the 
generation probabilities for those alignments that 
map a complete word into a single character. In 
fact, there are only about 10% of such alignments, 
and many of which are mapping a two-character
word into a single character ?which can be 
compensated by the large Pr?1|2? factor in the
model. This simple normalization approach 
actually improves the test set performance greatly. 
The following table shows the test set
performance for using different features in the 
abbreviation probability as given in Equation 3.

Table 3. Test Set Performance for 
Abbreviation Generation with Combined 
Features. 
Each column shows the test set performance for 
a submodel, which is identified by the features 
used for estimating the probability. The label ?1?
?or ?0?? indicates that the feature at the first 
column is used ?or unused? in the submodel. For 
instance, the submodel of the second column 
??111?? uses all the features, including the word 
transition 
probability, 
word-to-abbreviation 
probability, probability for mapping n character 
word to a particular abbreviation bit pattern 
P?bit|n?, and the probability for mapping 
n-character words into m-character abbreviations. 
It is seen that supervised training acquires a 
little better performance than its unsupervised ?EM? 
counterpart. Although not shown in this table, it is 
observed that the word transition probability and 
word-to-abbreviation probability in general should 
be used to get better performance. The table also 
shows that the other two features based on 
character positions and word lengths provide 
additional help. In particular, P?bit|n? seems to be
more helpful than P?m|n? since it contains detailed 
information for retaining characters at particular
positions. 
The best performance is about 72% when 
supervised training is used and all the three types 
of features are used for estimating the abbreviation 
probability.

4.2 Guessing Roots from Abbreviations 
In this experiment, we are given an 
abbreviation list; the goal is to guess the best root
words of the abbreviations in the list. The 
parameters used here are acquired from human 
tagged alignments in a supervised manner. 
To find the best root candidates of an 
abbreviated compound word, we need to find the 
candidate root words for each input character first. 
The candidate root words can be found from the 
training set whose generation probability 
?
?
i
i
w
c
P |
is non-zero. The Top-N candidates can 
then be picked up as described earlier. 
For instance, if we want to find the root words 
of the abbreviation ?
?, and the probabilities 
P? |
? and P? |
? are non-zero, then we 
have the chance to recover the abbreviation ?
? back to the correct compound word ?
? , which consists of the candidate root words 
?
? and ?
? for the input characters ? ? 
and ? ? respectively. 
Unfortunately, the limited abbreviation 
dictionary we have is highly sparse. Among the 
249 abbreviations in the test set, only 144 ?58%? of 
them have their candidate root words available in 
the training set. The other 105 abbreviations ?42%? 
cannot be recovered since each of them has at least
one character whose candidate cannot be 
discovered from the training set. For this reason,
we will limit ourselves to the performance of the 
?trainable? test set consisting of the 144 
abbreviations, in order to factor out the sparseness

problem pertaining to the training corpus. 
Under such a restricted environment, we have 
tested various submodels to see how different 
language models and simple smoothing affect the 
results of this error recovery process. The results 
are summarized in the following table:

instead. Both of them use 
maximum likelihood estimation over the manually 
tagged abbreviation-root pairs when smoothing is 
not applied. When smoothing is applied, the 
smoothed bigram probability is acquired by 
linearly interpolating the unigram and bigram
probabilities with an equal weight ?0.5?. The above 
table indicates that using the less complicated 
unigram model generally improve the test set 
performance significantly ?from 35% to 44%?. If 
the model parameters are smoothed, the 
improvement is even greater. Such results can be 
well expected in the current environment where 
the training data is very sparse. 
Overall, the best test set performance is about
51% when using a smoothed bigram language
model; and this can be achieved by using at most 2
Top-N candidate root words while constructing the 
underlying word lattice. This suggests that we 
don?t really need to wildly enumerate all possible 
candidate root words for each input character with
this model. 
5. Concluding Remarks 
Chinese abbreviations, a special form of 
unknown words and named entities, are widely 
seen in the modern Chinese texts. This results in 
difficulty for correct Chinese processing. In this 
preliminary study, the Chinese abbreviation 
problem is modeled as an error recovery problem
in which the suspect root words are to be
recovered from a set of candidates. An 
HMM-based model is thus used for Chinese in
either abbreviation identification, or in the 
recovery of the root words from an abbreviation.

By extending a simple abbreviation string into a
whole text involving abbreviations, it can also be 
applied to the Chinese word segmentation for 
identifying abbreviations in a text, or for 
bootstrapping an abbreviation dictionary from a 
text corpus. 
With the proposed model, the abbreviated 
forms can be guessed from root words at about 
72% correction. The recovery of the root words 
from abbreviations is conducted at about 51% 
accuracy rate. Although further improvement is 
possible, the preliminary results are encouraging. 
In the near future, bootstrapping a large 
abbreviation dictionary from web text by applying 
the proposed models is planned. This should 
partially resolve the data sparseness problems. 
Such models will also be integrated into a Chinese 
Page 8
word segmentation model to partially resolve the 
unknown word and named entity identification 
problems in the tokenization process. It is expected 
that more applications will rely on such models for 
Chinese processing.
