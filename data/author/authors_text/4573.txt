Abstract
In this paper we present a Two-Phase
LMR-RC Tagging scheme to perform
Chinese word segmentation. In the
Regular Tagging phase, Chinese sen-
tences are processed similar to the orig-
inal LMR Tagging. Tagged sentences
are then passed to the Correctional Tag-
ging phase, in which the sentences are
re-tagged using extra information from
the first round tagging results. Two
training methods, Separated Mode and
Integrated Mode, are proposed to con-
struct the models. Experimental re-
sults show that our scheme in Inte-
grated Mode performs the best in terms
of accuracy, where Separated Mode is
more suitable under limited computa-
tional resources.
1 Introduction
The Chinese word segmentation is a non-trivial
task because no explicit delimiters (like spaces
in English) are used for word separation. As the
task is an important precursor to many natural lan-
guage processing systems, it receives a lot of at-
tentions in the literature for the past decade (Wu
and Tseng, 1993; Sproat et al, 1996). In this pa-
per, we propose a statistical approach based on
the works of (Xue and Shen, 2003), in which the
Chinese word segmentation problem is first trans-
formed into a tagging problem, then the Max-
imum Entropy classifier is applied to solve the
problem. We further improve the scheme by in-
troducing correctional treatments after first round
tagging. Two different training methods are pro-
posed to suit our scheme.
The paper is organized as follows. In Sec-
tion 2, we briefly discuss the scheme proposed by
(Xue and Shen, 2003), followed by our additional
works to improve the performance. Experimen-
tal and bakeoff results are presented in Section 3.
Finally, We conclude the paper in Section 4.
2 Our Proposed Approach
2.1 Chinese Word Segmentation as Tagging
One of the difficulties in Chinese word segmen-
tation is that, Chinese characters can appear in
different positions within a word (Xue and Shen,
2003), and LMR Tagging was proposed to solve
the problem. The basic idea of LMR Tagging is
to assign to each character, based on its contextual
information, a tag which represents its relative po-
sition within the word. Note that the original tag
set used by (Xue and Shen, 2003) is simplified
and improved by (Ng and Low, 2004) . We shall
then adopt and illustrate the simplified case here.
The tags and their meanings are summarized
in Table 1. Tag L, M, and R correspond to the
character at the beginning, in the middle, and at
the end of the word respectively. Tag S means
the character is a ?single-character? word. Fig-
ure 1 illustrates a Chinese sentence segmented by
spaces, and the corresponding tagging results.
After transforming the Chinese segmentation
problem to the tagging problem, various so-
lutions can be applied. Maximum Entropy
model (MaxEnt) (Berger, S. A. Della Pietra, and
183
Original sentence: ??????????
After segmentation: ?? ?? ? ???? ?
Tagging: ?? ?? ? ???? ?
Figure 1: Example of LMR Tagging.
V. J. Della Pietra, 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1996) was
proposed in the original work to solve the LMR
Tagging problem. In order to make MaxEnt suc-
cess in LMR Tagging, feature templates used in
capturing useful contextual information must be
carefully designed. Furthermore, it is unavoid-
able that invalid tag sequences will occur if we
just assign the tag with the highest probability. In
the next subsection, we describe the feature tem-
plates and measures used to correct the tagging.
Table 1: Tags used in LMR Tagging scheme.
Tag Description
L Character is at the beginning of the word (or the
character is the leftmost character in the word)
M Character is in the middle of the word
R Character is at the end of the word (or the charac-
ter is the rightmost character in the word)
S Character is a ?single-character? word
2.2 Two-Phase LMR-RC Tagging
In this section, we introduce our Two-Phase LMR-
RC Tagging used to perform Chinese Text Seg-
mentation. The first phase, R-phase, is called Reg-
ular Tagging, in which similar procedures as in
the original LMR Tagging are performed. The
difference in this phase as compared to the origi-
nal one is that, we use extra feature templates to
capture characteristics of Chinese word segmen-
tation. The second phase, C-phase, is called Cor-
rectional Tagging, in which the sentences are re-
tagged by incorporating the regular tagging re-
sults. We hope that tagging errors can be cor-
rected under this way. The models used in both
phases are trained using MaxEnt model.
Regular Tagging Phase
In this phase, each character is tagged similar
to the original approach. In our scheme, given
the contextual information (x) of current charac-
ter, the tag (y?) with highest probability will be
assigned:
y? = argmax
y?{L,M,R,S}
p(y|x).
The features describing the characteristics of
Chinese segmentation problem are instantiations
of the feature templates listed in Table 2. Note
that feature templates only describe the forms of
features, but not the actual features. So the num-
ber of features used is much larger than the num-
ber of templates.
Table 2: Feature templates used in R-phase. Ex-
ample used is ?32????.
Feature Type Example ? Features
extracted of

1 Characters within
window of ?2

5 ASCII characters
within window of ?2

(as ?3? and ?2? are
ASCII)
6 Current and character
in window ?1 belong
to different types
D?1
(as ?2? is digit, but ?
?? is letter)
Additional feature templates as compared to
(Xue and Shen, 2003) and (Ng and Low, 2004)
are template 5 and 6. Template 5 is used to han-
dle documents with ASCII characters. For tem-
plate 6, as it is quite common that word boundary
occurs in between two characters with different
types, this template is used to capture such char-
acteristics.
Correctional Tagging Phase
In this phase, the sequence of characters is re-
tagged by using the additional information of tag-
ging results after R-phase. The tagging procedure
is similar to the previous phase, except extra fea-
tures (listed in Table 3) are used to assist the tag-
ging.

Training Method
Two training methods are proposed to construct
models used in R- and C-phase: (1) Separated
Mode, and (2) Integrated Mode. Separated Mode
means the models used in two phases are sepa-
rated. Model for R-phase is called R-model, and
model for C-phase is called C-model. Integrated
Mode means only one model, I-model is used in
both phases.
The training methods are illustrated now. First
of all, training data are divided into three parts,
(1) Regular Training, (2) Correctional Training,
and (3) Evaluation. Our method first trains using
observations extracted from Part 1 (observation is
simply the pair (context, tag) of each character).
The created model is used to process Part 2. After
that, observations extracted from Part 2 (which in-
clude previous tagging results) are used to create
the final model. The performance is then evalu-
ated by processing Part 3.
Let O be the set of observations, with sub-
scripts R or C indicating the sources of them. Let
TrainModel : O ? P , where P is the set of
models, be the ?model generating? function. The
two proposed training methods can be illustrated
as follow:
1. Separated Mode
R?model = TrainModel(OR),
C ?model = TrainModel(OC).
2. Integrated Mode
I ?model = TrainModel(OR ?OC).
The advantage of Separated Mode is that, it is
easy to aggregate different sets of training data.
It also provides a mean to handle large training
data under limited resources, as we can divide the
training data into several parts, and then use the
similar idea to train each part. The drawback of
this mode is that, it may lose the features? charac-
teristics captured from Part 1 of training data, and
Integrated Mode is proposed to address the prob-
lem, in which all the features? characteristics in
both Part 1 and Part 2 are used to train the model.
3 Experimental Results and Discussion
We conducted closed track experiments on the
Hong Kong City University (CityU) corpus in
The Second International Chinese Word Segmen-
tation Bakeoff to evaluate the proposed training
and tagging methods. The training data were split
into three portions. Part 1: 60% of the data is
trained for R-phase; Part 2: 30% for C-phase
training; and Part 3: the remaining 10% for eval-
uation. The evaluation part was further divided
into six parts to simulate actual size of test doc-
ument. The MaxEnt classifier was implemented
using Java opennlp maximum entropy package
from (Baldridge, Morton, and Bierner, 2004), and
training was done with feature cutoff of 2 and 160
iterations. The experiments were run on an Intel
Pentium4 3.0GHz machine with 3.0GB memory.
To evaluate our proposed scheme, we carried
out four experiments for each evaluation data. For
Experiment 1, data were processed with R-phase
only. For Experiment 2, data were processed with
both R- and C-phase, using Separated Mode as
training method. For Experiment 3, data were
processed similar to Experiment 2, except Inte-
grated Mode was used. Finally for Experiment
4, data were processed similar to Experiment 1,
with both Part 1 and Part 2 data were used for R-
model training. The purpose of Experiment 4 is to
determine whether the proposed scheme can per-
form better than just the single Regular Tagging
under the same amount of training data. Table 4
summarizes the experimental results measured in
F-measure (the harmonic mean of precision and
recall).
From the results, we obtain the following ob-
servations.
1. Both Integrated and Separated Training modes

in Two-Phase Tagging (Exp 2 and Exp 3) out-
perform single Regular Tagging (Exp 1). It is
reasonable as more data are used in training.
2. Integrated Mode (Exp 3) still performs better
than Exp 4, in which same amount of training
data are used. This reflects that extra tagging
information after R-phase helps in the scheme.
3. Separated Mode (Exp 2) performs worse than
both Exp 3 and Exp 4. The reason is that the C-
model cannot capture enough features? charac-
teristics used for basic tagging. We believe that
by adjusting the proportion of Part 1 and Part 2
of training data, performance can be increased.
4. Under limited computational resources, in
which constructing single-model using all
available data (as in Exp 3 and Exp 4) is not
possible, Separated Mode shows its advantage
in constructing and aggregating multi-models
by dividing the training data into different por-
tions.
The official BakeOff2005 results are summa-
rized in Table 5. We have submitted multiple re-
sults for CityU, MSR and PKU corpora by ap-
plying different tagging methods described in the
paper.

4 Conclusion
We present a Two-Phase LMR-RC Tagging
scheme to perform Chinese word segmentation.
Correctional Tagging phase is introduced in ad-
dition to the original LMR Tagging technique, in
which the Chinese sentences are re-tagged using
extra information of first round tagging results.
Two training methods, Separated Mode and In-
tegrated Mode, are introduced to suit our scheme.
Experimental results show that Integrated Mode
achieve the highest accuracy in terms of F-
measure, where Separated Mode shows its ad-
vantages in constructing and aggregating multi-
models under limited resources.
