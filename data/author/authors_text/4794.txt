Abstract 
We propose a novel syntax-based model 
for statistical machine translation in which 
meta-structure (MS) and meta-structure se-
quence (SMS) of a parse tree are defined. 
In this framework, a parse tree is decom-
posed into SMS to deal with the structure 
divergence and the alignment can be recon-
structed at different levels of recombination 
of MS (RM). RM pairs extracted can per-
form the mapping between the sub-
structures across languages.  As a result, 
we have got not only the translation for the 
target language, but an SMS of its parse 
tree at the same time. Experiments with 
BLEU metric show that the model signifi-
cantly outperforms Pharaoh, a state-art-the-
art phrase-based system. 
1 Introduction 
The statistical approach has been widely used in 
machine translation, which use the noisy-channel-
based model. A joint probability model, proposed 
by Marcu and Wong (2002), is a kind of phrase-
based one. Och and Ney (2004) gave a framework 
of alignment templates for this kind of models. All 
of the phrase-based models outperformed the 
word-based models, by automatically learning 
word and phrase equivalents from bilingual corpus 
and reordering at the phrase level. But it has been 
found that phrases longer than three words have 
little improvement in the performance (Koehn, 
2003). Above the phrase level, these models have a 
simple distortion model that reorders phrases inde-
pendently, without consideration of their contents 
and syntactic information. 
In recent years, applying different statistical 
learning methods to structured data has attracted 
various researchers. Syntax-based MT approaches 
began with Wu (1997), who introduced the Inver-
sion Transduction Grammars. Utilizing syntactic 
structure as the channel input was introduced into 
MT by Yamada (2001). Syntax-based models have 
been presented in different grammar formalisms. 
The model based on Head-transducer was pre-
sented by Alshawi (2000). Daniel Gildea (2003) 
dealt with the problem of the parse tree isomor-
phism with a cloning operation to either tree-to-
string or tree-to-tree alignment models. Ding and 
Palmer (2005) introduced a version of probabilistic 
extension of Synchronous Dependency Insertion 
Grammars (SDIG) to deal with the pervasive 
structure divergence. All these approaches don?t 
model the translation process, but formalize a 
model that generates two languages at the same 
time, which can be considered as some kind of tree 
transducers. Graehl and Knight (2004) described 
the use of tree transducers for natural language 
processing and addressed the training problems for 
this kind of transducers.  
In this paper, we define a model based on the 
MS decomposition of the parse trees for statistical 
machine translation, which can capture structural 
variations and has a proven generation capacity. 
During the translation process of our model, the 
parse tree of the source language is decomposed 
into different levels of MS and then transformed 
into the ones of the target language in the form of 
RM. The source language can be reordered accord-
ing to the structure transformation. At last, the tar-
get translation string is generated in the scopes of 
RM. In the framework of this model,

Figure 1: MS and the SMS and RM for a given parser tree 
 
the RM transformation can be regarded as produc-
tion rules and be extracted automatically from the 
bilingual corpus. The overall translation probabil-
ity is thus decomposed.  
In the rest of this paper, we first give the 
definitions for MS, SMS, RM and the 
decomposition of the parse tree in section 2.1, we 
give a detailed description of our model in section 
2.2, section 3 describes the training details and 
section 4 describes the decoding algorithms, and 
then the experiment (section 5) proves that our 
model can outperform the baseline model, 
pharaoh, under the same condition.  
2 The model 
2.1 MS for a parse tree 
      A source language sentence (s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 s6), 
and its parse tree S-P, are given in Figure 1.We 
also give the translation of the sentence, which is 
illustrated as (t1 t2 t3).Its parse tree is T-P.  
Definition 1 
MS of a parse tree  
We call a sub-tree a MS of a parse tree, if it sat-
isfies the following constraints: 
1. An MS should be a sub-tree of a parse tree 
2. Its direct sons of the leaf nodes in the sub-
tree are the words or punctuations of the sen-
tence  
For example, each of the sub-trees in the right- 
hand of Figure 1 is an MS for the parse tree of S-P.  
 The sub-tree of [I [G, D, H]] of S-P is not an MS, 
because the direct sons of the leaf nodes, G, D, H,  
are not words in the sentence of (s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 
s6).  
Definition 2 SMS and RM 
A sequence of MS is called a meta-structure 
sequence (SMS) of a parse tree if and only if,   
1. Its elements are MS of the parse tree 
2. The parse tree can be reconstructed with the 
elements in the same order as in the sequence. 
  It is denoted as SMS [T(S)].1 Two examples 
for the concept of SMS can be found in Figure1. 
RM(recombination of MS) is a sub-sequence 
of SMS. We can express an SMS as differ-
ent )]([1 STRM
k .The parse tree of S-P in Figure1 
is decomposed into SMS and expressed in the 
framework of RM. The two RM, ][21 PSRM ? , 
are used to express its parse tree in Figure1.It is 
noted that there is structure divergence between 
the two parse trees in Figure1. The corresponding 
node of Node I in the tree S-P cannot be found in 
the tree T-P. But under the conception of RM, the 
structure alignments can be achieved at the level 
of RM, which is illustrated in Figure2.

  In Figure2, both of the parse trees are decom-
posed and reconstructed in the forms of RM. The 
alignments based on RM are illustrated at the 
same time. 
2.2 Description of the model   
In the framework of Statistical machine transla-
tion, the task is to find the sentence e for the given 
foreign language f, which can be described in the 
following formulation.

To make the model have the ability to model 
the structure transformation, some hidden vari-
ables are introduced into the probability equation. 
To make the equations simple to read, we take 
some denotations different from the above defini-
tions. SMS[T(S)] is denoted as SM[T(S)].  
The first variable is the SM[T(S)], we induce 
the equation as follows?

 In order to simplify this model we have two as-
sumptions: 
An assumption is that the generation of SMS [T

A detailed list of the feature functions for the 
model and some explanations are given as below:

the words in any RM can be transformed 
into the target language words just in the 
way of phrase-based model, serving as an-
other reordering factor at a different level:

example in Figure3, ),|( BBAACCP  is used to de-
scribe the probability of the RM sequence, (AA, 
BB) should be followed by RM (CC) in  the 
translation process. This function can ensure 
that a more reasonable sub-tree can be generated 
for the target language. That would be explained 
further in section 3.

(14) 
The phrase-based model (Koehn, 2003) is a 
special case of this framework, if we take the 
whole structure of the parse tree as the only MS of 
the parse tree of the sentence, and set some special 
feature weights to zero. 
From the description above, we know the 
framework of this model. When transformed to 
target languages, the source language is reordered 
at the RM level first. In this process, only the 
knowledge of the structure is taken into 
consideration. It is obvious that a lot of sentences 
in the source language can have the same RM. So 
this model has better generative ability. At the 
same time, RM is a subsequence of SMS, which 
consists of different hierarchical MS. So RM is a 
structure, which can model the structure mapping 
across the sub-tree structure. By decomposing the 
source parse tree, the isomorphic between the 
parse trees can be obtained, at the level of RM. 
When reordering at the RM level, this model 
just takes an RM as a symbol, and it can perform a 
long distance reordering job according to the 
knowledge of RM alignments.  
3 Training        
For training the model, a parallel tree corpus is 
needed. The methods and details are described as 
follows:  
3.1 Decomposition of the parse tree 
To reduce the amount of MS used in decoding 
and training, we take some constrains for the MS. 
?1?.The height of the sub-tree shouldn?t be 
greater than a fixed value?  ; 
    ? 2?.  ???
)(
)(
heightN
nodesLeafN
 
Given a parse tree, we get the initial SMS in 
such a top -down and left- to ?right way.  
Any node is deleted if the sub-tree can?t satisfy 
the constrains (1), (2).

any Ms to generate new SMS, applying the same 
operation to any SMS 
3.2 Parallel SMS and Estimation of the pa-
rameters for RM transformations 
We can get bi-lingual SMS by recombining all 
the possible SMS obtained from the parallel 
parse trees. nm ?  Parallel SMS can be obtained 
if m is the number of SMS for a parse tree in the 
source language, n for the target one. 
The alignments of the parallel MS and extrac-
tion can be performed in such a simple way. 
Given the parallel tree corpus, we first get the 
alignments based on the level of words, for which 
we used GIZA++ in both of the directions. Ac-
cording to the knowledge of the word alignments, 
we derived the alignments of leave nodes of the 
given parse trees, which are the direct root nodes 
of the words. Then all the knowledge of the words 
is discarded for the RM extraction. The next step 
for the extraction of the RM is based on the popu-
lar phrase-extraction algorithm of the phrase-
based statistical machine translation model. The 
present alignment and phrase extraction methods 
can be applied to the extraction of the MS and RM 
[T(S)].

We didn?t meet with the serious data sparseness 
problem in this part of work, because most of the 
MS structures have occurred enough times for 
parameters estimation. But we still set some 
fixed value for the unseen parameters in the 
training set. 
4 Decoding  
A beam search algorithm is applied to this 
model for decoding, which is based on the frame 
of the beam search for phrase-based statistical 
machine translation (Koehn et al 03). 
Here the process of the hypothesis generation is 
presented. Given a sentence and its parse tree, all 
the possible candidate RM are collected, which 
can cover a part of the parse tree at the bottom. 
With the candidates, the hypotheses can be 
formed and extended. 
For example, all the parse tree?s leaf nodes of a 
Chinese sentence in Figure4, are covered by [r], 
[ pron ] and  VP[vg-BNP[pron-n]] in the order of 
choosing candidate RM{ (1),  (2), (3)}.

Before the next expansion of a hypothesis, the 
words in the scope of the present RM are trans-
lated into the target language and the correspond-
ing )]([ eTRM i  is generated. For example, when  
),( VBDWRBr , is used to expand the hypothe-
sis , the words in the sub-tree are translated into 
the target language, ???how did.        
We also need to calculate the cost for the hy-
potheses according to the parameters in the model 
to perform the beam search. The task for the beam 
search is to find the hypothesis with the least cost.  
When the expansion of a hypothesis comes to the 
final state, the target language is generated. All of 
the leave nodes of the parse tree for the source 
language are covered. The parser for the target 
language isn?t used for decoding. But a target 
SMS is generated during the process of decoding 
to achieve better reordering performance. 
5 Experiments   
The experiment was conducted for the task of 
Chinese-to-English translation. A corpus, which 
consists of 602,701 sentence pairs, was used as 
the training set. We took CLDC 863 test set as our 
test set (http://www.chineseldc.org/resourse.asp), 
which consists of 467 sentences with an average 
length of 14.287 Chinese words and 4 references. 
To evaluate the result of the translation, the BLEU 
metric (Papineni et al 2002) was used.  
5.1 The baseline 
System used for comparison was Pharaoh 
(Koehn et al, 2003; Koehn, 2004), which uses a 
beam search algorithm for decoding. In its model, 
it takes the following features: language model, 
phrase translation probability in the two directions, 
distortion model, word penalty and phrase penalty, 
all of which can be achieved with the training 
toolkits distributed by Koehn. The training set and 
development set mentioned above were used to 
perform the training task and to tune the feature 
weights by the minimum error training algorithm. 
All the other settings were the same as the default 
ones. SRI Language Modeling Toolkit was used 
to train a 3-gram language model. After training, 
164 MB  language model were obtained. 
5.2 Our model 
All the common features shared with Pharaoh 
were trained with the same toolkits and the same 
corpus. Besides those features, we need to train 
the structure transformation model and the mono-
lingual structure model for our model. First, 
10,000 sentence pairs were selected to achieve the

corpus. SRI Language Modeling Toolkits were 
used again to train this part of parameters. In this 
experiment, we set 3=? ,and 5.1=? . 149MB 
)]([ sTRMS  pairs and a 25 MB 3-gram mono-
lingual structure model were obtained.  
6. Conclusion and Future work 
A framework for statistical machine translation 
is created in this paper. The results of the experi-
ments show that this model gives better perform-
ance, compared with the baseline system. 
This model can incorporate the syntactic infor-
mation into the process of translation and model 
the sub-structure projections across the parallel 
parse trees. 
The advantage of this frame work lies in that 
the reordering operations can be performed at the 
different levels according to the hierarchical RM 
of the parse tree. 
But we should notice that some independent as-
sumptions were made in the decomposition of the 
parse tree. In the future, a proper method should 
be introduced into this model to achieve the most 
possible decomposition of the parse tree. In fact, 
we can incorporate some other feature functions 
into the model to model the structure transforma-
tion more effectively.
