Abstract
In this paper, we propose a semantic role label-
ing method using a maximum entropy model,
which enables not only to exploit rich features
but also to alleviate the data sparseness prob-
lem in a well-founded model. For applying the
maximum entropy model to semantic role la-
beling, we take a incremental approach as fol-
lows: firstly, the semantic roles are assigned to
the arguments in the immediate clause includ-
ing a predicate, and then, the semantic roles are
assigned to the arguments in the upper clauses
by using previously assigned labels. The exper-
imental result shows that the proposed method
has about 64.76% (F1-measure) on the test set.
1 Introduction
The semantic role represents the relationship between a
predicate and an argument. It provides a general semantic
interpretation of the sentence, and it can play a key role
in NLP. The shared task of CoNLL-2004 concerns the
automatic semantic role labeling (Carreras, 2004). The
challenge for this task is to come forward with machine
learning approaches which based on only partial syntactic
information such as words, POS tags, chunks, clauses,
and named entities.
Some machine learning approaches for semantic role
labeling have been previously developed (Gildea, 2002;
Pradhan, 2003; Thompson, 2003). Gildea (2002) pro-
posed a probabilistic discriminative model to assign a
semantic roles to the constituent. However, it needs a
complex interpolation for smoothing because of the data
sparseness problem. Pradhan (2003) applied a support
vector machine to semantic role labeling, but if it use
a polynomial kernel function for the dependencies be-
tween features, it requires high computational complex-
ity. Futhermore, becuase the SVM is a binary classifier,
one-vs-rest or pairwise method is required for multi-class
classification. Thompson (2003) proposed a probabilis-
tic generative model which the constituents is generated
by the semantic roles. In this model, because a con-
stituent depends only on the role that generated it, and
constituents are independent of each other, so this model
can not utilize contextual information or a relational in-
formation between the constituent and the predicate.
In this paper, we propose a semantic role labeling
method using a maximum entropy model. It is moti-
vated by the thought of that for building a successful
model, some knowledge of the task are reflected into
the model based on the machine learning technique. In
this method, we try to combine the structural linguistic
knowledge linking syntax to semantics into the machine
learning technique. It is realized in terms of two aspects:
one is the model framework, the other is the design of
feature sets. First of all, for the model framework, we uti-
lize the syntactic knowledge of representing the semantic
roles in a clause: the arguments of a predicate are located
in the immediate clause or the upper clauses. Secondly,
for the feature sets, we consider the relation between syn-
tactic and semantic characteristics of a given context. For
implementing the method with a machine learning algo-
rithm, we take a maximum entropy model, which enables
not only to exploit rich features but also to alleviate the
data sparseness problem in a well-founded model.
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows:
section 2 describes the proposed semantic role labeling
method using a maximum entropy model. Section 3
presents feature sets for semantic role labeling. Section 4
shows some experimental results of the proposed method.
Finally, section 5 concludes with some directions of fu-
ture works.
2 Semantic Role Labeling using ME
In the maximum entropy framework (Berger, 1996), the
conditional probability of predicting an outcome y given

a history x is defined as follows :
P (y|x) =
1
Z(x)
exp
(
k
?
i=1
?
i
f
i
(x, y)
)
where f
i
(x, y) is the feature function, ?
i
is the weighting
parameter of f
i
(x, u), k is the number of features, and
Z(x) is the normalization factor for
?
y
p(y|x) = 1.
Given a predicate and its partial parse tree represented
by constituents such as chunks and clauses, the proba-
bilistic model for semantic role labeling assigns the se-
mantic role labels to the constituents as described in the
equation (1).

where R is a sequence of the semantic roles, c
1n
is a se-
quence of constituents, pred is the given predicate, r
i
is
the i-th semantic role, n is the number of constituents.
In order to apply the equation (1) to an incremental
approach, we classify clauses into the immediate clause
and the upper clause. The immediate clause is the clause
which contains the target predicate, and the upper clause
is the clause which includes the immediate clause. Gen-
erally, most of the arguments of the predicate are located
in the immediate clause while some of them are located
in the upper clauses, especially the first or second up-
per clauses. Since it is much easier and more reliable to
identify the arguments in the immediate clause, the pro-
posed method first assigns the semantic role labels to the
constituents 1 in the immediate clause. Then, it assigns
the semantic role labels to the constituents in the upper
clauses by using previously assigned labels. This incre-
mental approach is described in the equation (2) derived
from the equation (1).

1Here, we regard a chunk or a clause as a constituent.
where m is the number of constituents covered by the im-
mediate clause, ?

is a feature set for immediate clause,
and ?
2
is a feature set for upper clauses.
A semantic role label(r
i
) is represented by using a BIO
notation such as B-A*, I-A*, etc. However, O is too fre-
quently occurred than other semantic role labels, it can
have a somewhat high probability than others. Therefore,
to degrade its probability, we divide the single O into O-,
O+, O0with respect to the position of a constituent which
is relative to the predicate. Therefore, B-A*, I-A*, O-,
O+, and O0 are used as semantic roles as shown in Fig-
ure 1.
After processing the equation (2), we use some heuris-
tic to attach the some semantic roles and to adjust the
boundary of semantic arguments in the post-processing
step. More specifically, we use some rules to attach the
V, AM-MOD, and AM-NEG, and extend the boundary
of core roles to include to infinitive of the VP chunk like
?expect/B-VP (A1 to/I-VP take/I-VP dive/B-NP)?.
3 Feature Sets for Semantic Role Labeling
For accurate semantic role labeling, we regard that the
following information is important: the contextual infor-
mation of the constituent, the syntactic information of the
predicate, and the relation between the constituent and
the predicate. Therefore, we use the features presented in
Table 1 for semantic role labeling. For example, Figure
previous-label(pl)
predicate-POS(predpos), predicate-lex(predlex)
predicate-type(predtype)
tag(ctag), voice(v), position(p), path(path)
head-lex(hl), head-POS(hp), content-head(chl)
prev-tag(ptag), prev-head-lex(phl)
next-tag(ntag), next-head-lex(nhl)
path-immediate-clause(path-im-cl)
path-begin-end(path-beg-end)
level-of-clause(l-cl), is-clause-boundary(cl-bn)
immediate-clause-roles(im-cl-roles)

Table 2: Conjoined Feature Sets
2 shows how the features in Table 1 are used for labeling
semantic roles to the proposition in Figure 1.
Because the maximum entropy model assumes the in-
dependence of features, we should conjoin the coherent
features. As presented in Table 2, we use the conjoined
feature sets to assign semantic roles to the constituents of
the immediate clause and the upper clauses.
The predicate-type feature represents the predicate us-
age such as to-infinitive form (TO), the beginning of the
immediate clause (BEG), and otherwise (SEN). The tag
feature represents the tag of the current constituent. If it
is a clause, it is subdivided into a relative pronoun, a in-
finitival relative clause, etc according to its represented
form.
The path feature indicates the sequence of constituent
tags between the current constituent and the predicate.
The voice feature is determined to be an active or pas-
sive voice of the predicate, and the position feature is as-
signed by the constituent position with respect to pred-
icate. These features implicitly represent the predicate-
argument relation such as predicate-subject or predicate-
object.
For the headword feature, we use the Collins? head-
word rules, and as a complementary feature to the head
word feature, a content word feature2 is used to represent
the content of the PP, VP, or CONJP chunk.
The path-immediate-clause feature is the sequence of
constituent tags between the current constituent and the
immediate clause, and the path-begin-end feature is the
sequence between current constituent and beginning/end
of clause. The level-of-clause feature indicates whether
the current constituent is located in the first upper clause
or in the second upper clause, and the is-clause-boundary
feature is the binary value which indicates the existence
of the starting clause. The immediate-clause-roles fea-
tures are the binary indicators to represent whether the
core arguments exist in the immediate clause or not.
The path-immediate-clause, path-begin-end, level-of-
clause, is-clause-boundary, and immediate-clause-roles
features are used only in the second phase, and the others
except the path feature and the content-head feature are
used in common.
2For example, if the PP-chunk is because of, the headword
feature is of, and the content word feature is because.

4 Experiments
To test the proposed method, we have experimented on
CoNLL-2004 datasets. For our experiments, we use the
Zhang le?s MaxEnt toolkit 3, and the L-BFGS parame-
ter estimation algorithm with Gaussian Prior smoothing
(Chen, 1999). The results on the test set are shown in
Table 3, and Table 4 shows the overall results when the
model is tested on the training set, the development set,
and the test set.
From these experimental results, we can find that the
proposed model has relatively high performance on the
labels related to A0 and A1, while it has relatively low
performance on the other labels. This may be caused by
following two reasons. Firstly, the instances of A0 or A1
are provided enough for accurate semantic role labeling.
Secondly, the thematic roles of A0 and A1 are more clear
than other core semantic roles. For example, agent is la-
beled as mainly A0 while benefactive can be labeled as
A2 or A3. Therefore, the maximum entropy model can

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a semantic role labeling method
using a maximum entropy model. Because the maximum
entropy model enables not only to exploit rich features
but also to alleviate the data sparseness problem, we use
it to model the probability of a semantic role label se-
quence. The proposed method has following characteris-
tics: firstly, it assigns the semantic role labels to the con-
stituents in the immediate clause, and then assigns role
labels to the constituents in the upper clauses, and it uti-
lizes the relation between syntactic and semantic charac-
teristics of a given context.
For the future work, we will device a method of clus-
tering for the path and predicate features, and include the
clustering results as additional features.
