Abstract 
Contextual information and the mapping 
from WordNet synsets to Cilin sense tags 
deal with word sense disambiguation. The 
average performance is 63.36% when small 
categories are used, and 1, 2 and 3 
candidates are proposed for low, middle and 
high ambiguous words. The performance 
of tagging unknown words is 34.35%, which 
is much better than that of baseline mode. 
The sense tagger achieves the performance 
of 76.04%, when unambiguous, ambiguous, 
and unknown words are tagged. 
1 Introduction 
Tagging task, which adds lexical, syntactic or 
semantic information to raw text, makes 
materials more valuable. The researches on 
part of speech (POS) tagging have been a long 
history, and achieve very good results. Many 
POS-tagged corpora are available. The 
accuracy for POS-tagging is in the range of 95% 
to 97% 1 . In contrast, although the researches 
on word sense disambiguation (WSD) are also 
very early (Kelly and Stone, 1975), large-scale 
sense-tagged corpus is relatively few. In 
English, only some sense-tagged corpora such as 
HECTOR (Atkins, 1993), DSO (Ng and Lee, 
1996), SEMCOR (Fellbaum, 1997), and 
SENSEVAL (Kilgarriff, 1998) are available. 
For evaluating word sense disarnbiguation 
systems, the first SENSEVAL (Kilgarriff and 
Rosenzweig, 2000) reports that the performance 
for a fine-grained word sense disambiguation 
task is at around 75 %. 
1 The pelrforlnancg includes tagging wnzmbiguous 
words. Marslmll (1987) reported that the 
performance of CLAWS tagger is 94%. 
Approximately 65% of words were tagged 
nnambiguously, and the disambigualion program 
achieved better than 80% success on the ambiguous 
words. 
Tagging accuracy depends on several issues 
(Manning and Schutze, 1999), e.g., the amount 
of training data, the granularity of the tagging set, 
the occurrences of unknown words, and so on. 
Three approaches have been proposed for WSD, 
including dictionary/thesaurus-based pproach, 
supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. 
The major differences are what kinds of 
resources are used, i.e., dictionary versus text 
corpus, and sense-tagged corpus versus 
untagged eorpns. A good survey refers to the 
paper Ode and Veronis, 1998). Compared with 
English, Chinese does not have large-scale 
sense-tagged corpus. The widely available 
corpus is Academic Sinica Balanced Corpus 
abbreviated as ASBC hereafter (I-Iuang and 
Chen, 1995), which is a POS-tagged corpus. 
Thus, a computer-aided tool to sense-tag 
Chinese corpus is indispensable. 
This paper presents a sense tagger for 
Mandarin Chinese. It is organized as follows. 
Section 2 discusses the degree of polysemy in 
Mandarin Chinese from several viewpoints. 
Section 3 presents WSD algorithms for tagging 
ambiguous words and unknown words. 
Section 4 shows our experimental results. 
Finally, Section 5 concludes the remarks. 
2 Degree of Polysemy in Mandarin Chinese 
The degree of polysemy is defined as the 
average number of senses of words. We adopt 
tagging set from tong2yi4ei2ci21in2 (~ ~ ~q ~'\] 
~hk) abbreviated as Cilin (Mei, et al, 1982). It 
is composed of 12 large categories, 94 middle 
categories, and 1,428 small categories. 
Small categories (more fine granularity) are 
used to compute the distribution of word senses. 
Besides Cilin, ASBC is employed to count 
frequency of a word. Total 28,321 word types 
appear both in Cilin and in ASBC corpus. 
Here a word type corresponds toa dictionary

entry. Of these, 5,922 words are polysemous, 
i.e., they have more than one sense. Table 1 
lists the statistics. We divide the ambiguity 
degree into three levels according to the number 
of senses of a word. It includes low (2-4), 
middle (5-8), and high ambiguity (>8). The 
statistics shows that 93.77% of word types 
belong to the class of low ambiguity. 
We further consider POS when computing 
the distribution of word senses. Table 2 shows 
the statistics. N, V, A, F, and K denote nouns, 
verbs, adjectives, numerals, and auxiliaries 
(adverbs), respectively. We can find most of 
words belong to the class of low ambiguity no 
matter which POSes they are. Besides, the 
ambiguity is decreased when POS is considered. 
The number of polysemous words is down to 
4,132. For A and K, the number of senses is 
no more than 7, and the percentages in the class 
of  low degrees are 98.22% and 97.08%, 
respectively. For N and V, there are some high 
ambiguous words. In particular, the verb (6 ,  
da3) has 19 senses 2. The percentages in the 
class of low degrees are 97.53% and 94.70%, 
respectively. 
Then, the ffi'equency of word types is 
considered. ASBC corpus is used to compute 
the occurrences of  word types. Table 3 fists 
the statistics. A word token is an occurrence of 
a type in the corpus. On the average, the words 
of low, middle and high ambiguity appear 
205.96, 1926.65, and 4480.28 times, 
respectively. Table 1 shows 93.77% of 
polysemous words belong to the class of low 
ambiguity, but Table 3 illustrates they only 
2 The word (~, da3) has 20 senses. Besides verb 
usage, it also functions as art auxiliary.

occupy 58.52% of tokens in ASBC corpus. 
Table 4 summarizes the distribution of 
word senses and frequencies. Low frequency 
denotes the number of occurrences less than 100, 
middle frequency denotes the number of 
occurrences between 100 and 1000, and high 
frequency denotes the number of occurrences 
more than 1000. Rows C and A in Table 4 
denote number of word types and word tokens, 
respectively. The last column denotes 
percentage for each ambiguity degree. For 
example, the percentage of word types with low 
ambiguity is 96.64% (i.e., 3993/4132). This 
table shows the following two phenomena: 
(1) POS information reduces the degree of 
ambiguities. Total 8.94% of word tokens are 
high ambiguous in Table 3. It decreases to 
0.47% in Table 4. 
(2) High ambiguous words tend to be high 
frequent. From the row of low ambiguity, 
there are 3,112 low-frequent words. They 
occur 70,131 times in ASBC corpus. 
Comparatively, there are only 881 middle- or 
high-frequent words, but they occur 966,774 
times. That is, 23.67% of word types are 
middle- or high-frequent words, and they 
occupy 94.06% of word tokens. From the row 
of high ambiguity, there are only a few words, 
but they occur frequently in the ASBC corpus. 
It shows that semantic tagging is a ehallengeable 
problem in Mandarin Chinese. 
3 Semantic Tagging 
3.1 Tagging Unambiguous Words 
In the semantic tagging, the small categories are 
selected. We postulate that he sense definition 
for each word in Cilin is complete. That is, a 
word that has only one sense in Cilin is called an 
unambiguous word or a monosemous word. If 
POS information is also considered, a word may 
be unambiguous under a specific POS. 
Because we do not have a semantically tagged 
corpus for training, we try to acquire the context 
for each semantic tag strutting from the 
unambiguous words. 
ASBC corpus is the target we study. At 
the first stage, only those words that are 
unambiguous in Cilin, and also appear in ASBC 
corpus are tagged~ Figure 1 shows this cease. 
Unambiguous Words 
A S B ~ ~ ~  
Figure 1. Tagging Unambiguous Words 
An unambiguous word (and hence its sense 
tag) is characterized bythe words surrounding it.
The window size is set to 6, and stop words are 
removed. A list of stop words is trained from 
ASBC corpus. The words of POSes Neu (~ 
?~q), DE (~,  .~., ~,~-, ~) ,  SHI (~,.), FW (J'l '~ 
~) ,  C (i~l~j~q), T (~l~h~q), and I (~*~q)  
are regarded as stop words. A sense tag Ctag 
is in terms of a vector (wl, w2, ..., wn), where n 
is the vocabulary size and wi is a weight of word 
cw. The weight can be determined by the 
following two ways. 
(1) MI metric (Church, etal., 1989) 
34l (Ctag ,ew ) = 
P (Ctag, cw) 
log 2 P(Ctag )P(cw) = 
f (Ctag , ew ) ? 
l?g2 f (Ctag ) f (ew ) x zv 
where P(Ctag) is the probability of Crag, 
P(cw) is the probability of cw, 
P(Ctag, cw) is the cooccurrence 
probability of Crag and cw, 
J(Ctag) is the frequency of Ctag, 
.?ew) is the frequency of cw, 
~Ctag, cw) is the cooccurrence 
frequency of Ctag and cw, and 
N is total number of words in the 
corpus. 
(2) EM metric (Ballesteros and Croft, 1998) 
em(Ctag, cw)= 
( f(Ctag, cw)- En(Ctag, cw) 0 max f(Ctag)+ f(cw) " ) 
FEn (Ctag , cw )= f (Ctag ) f (cw ) 
N 
3.2 Tagging Ambiguous Words 
At the second stage, we deal with those words 
that have more than one sense in the Cilin. 
Figure 2 shows the words we consider. 
Unambiguous Words 
i  ilin 
Ambiguous Words 
Figure 2. Tagging Ambiguous Words 
The approach we adopted on semantic 
tagging rests on an underlying assumption: each 
sense has a characteristic ontext that is 
different from the context of all the other senses. 
In addition, all words expressing the same sense 
share the same characteristic context. We will 
apply the information trained at the first stage to 
selecting the best sense tag from the candidates 
of each ambiguous word. Recall that a vector 
corresponds to a sense tag. We employ the 
similar way specified in Section 3.1 to identify 
the context vector of an ambiguous word. A 
cosine formula shown as foUows measures the 
similarity between a sense vector and a context 
vector, where w and v are a sense vector and a 
context vector, respectively. The sense tag of 
the highest similarity score is chosen. 
W oV cos (w, v)--IwIIvl 
We retrain the sense vector for each sense tag 
after the unambiguous words are resolved. 
3.3 Tagging Unknown Words 
Those words that appear in ASBC corpus, but 
are not gathered in Cilin are called unknown 
words. All the 1,428 sense tags are the 
possible candidates. Intuitively, the algorithm 
in Section 3.2 can be applied directly to select a 
sense tag from the 1,428 candidates. However, 
the candidate set is very large. Here we adopt 
outside evidences from the mapping among 
WordNet synsets (Fellbaum, 1998) and Cflin

sense tags to narrow down the candidate set. 
Figure 3 summarizes the flow of our algorithm. 
It is illuslrated as follows. 
(1) Find all the English translations of an 
unknown Chinese word by looking up a 
Chinese-English dictionary. 
(2) Find all the symets of the English 
translations by looking up WordNet. We do 
not resolve translation ambiguity and target 
polysemy at these two steps, thus the retrieved 
symets may cover more senses than that of the 
original Chinese word. 
(3) Transform the synsets back to Cilin sense 
tags by looking up a mapping table. How the 
mapping table is set up will be discussed in 
Section 3.3. I. 
(4) Select a sense tag from the candidates 
proposed at step (3) by using the WSD in 
Section 3.2. 
Figure 4 shows the unknown words we deal 
with at this stage. Those words that are not 
gathered in our Chineso-English dictionary are 
not considered, so that only parts of unknown 
words are resolve. In other words, thore 
remain words without sense tags.

3.3.1 Mapping SynSets to Cilin Sense Tags 
At first, we put unambiguous words (specified 
in Section 3.1) into WordNet by looking up a 
Chinese-English dictionary. Although these 
words do not have translation ambiguity, the 
corresponding English translation may have 
target polysemy problem. In other words, the 
English translation may cover irrelevant senses 
besides the correct one. The following 
algorithm will find the most similar syuseet with 
Chinese sense tag. 
(1) If the English translation corresponds to 
only one symet, this symet is the solution. 
(2) If the English translation corresponds to 
more than one synset, POS is considered: 
(a) If the Chinese sense tag belongs to one of 
categories A-D in Cilin (i.e., a noun sense), 
and there is only one noun synset, then the 
synset is adopted. Otherwise, we translate 
the context vector of the Chinese sense into 
English, compare it with vectors of the 
synsets, and select he most similar synset. 
(b) If the Chinese sense tag belongs to one of 
categories F-J in Cilin (i.e., a verb sense), 
we try to find a verb syuset in the similar 
way as (a). If it fails, we try noun and 
adjective synsets instead. 
(c) If the Chinese sense tag bdongs to category 
E in Olin (i.e., an adjective sense), we try 
adjective, adverb, noun and verb symets in 
sequence. 
Off) If the Chinese sense tag belongs to category 
K in Cilin (i.e., an adverb sense), only 
adverb syasets are considered. 
Next, we consider the ambiguous words. 
Chinese-English dictionary lookup finds all the 
English translations. WordNet search coneets 
11 
the synset candidates for the translations. 
Some synsets are selected and regarded as the 
mapping of the Cilin sense tag. Here the 
problems of translation ambiguity and target 
polysemy must be faced. In other words, not 
all English translations cover the Cilin sense. 
Because the goal is to find a mapping table 
between WordNet synsets and Cflin sense tags, 
we neglect the problem of translation ambiguity 
and follow the method in the previous paragraph 
to choose the most similar synsets. 
During mapping, English translations of a 
word may not be found in the Chinese-English 
dictionary, and WordNet may not gather the 
English translations even dictionary look-up is 
successful. Thus, only 1,328 of 1,428 Cilin 
tags are mapped to WordNet synsets. From the 
other view, there remains some WordNet 
synsets that do not correspond toany Cilin sense 
tags. Let such a synset be Si. We follow the 
relational pointers like hypernym, hyponym, 
similar, derived, antonym, or participle to 
collect the neighboring synsets denoted by Sj. 
The following method selects suitable Cflin 
tag(s) for Si. 
(1) IfSj is the only one syuset that has been 
mapped to Cilin tags, we choose a Cilin 
tag and map Si to it. 
(2) If there exists more than one Sj (say, Sjl, 
Sj2, ..., S~) that has been mapped to 
Cilin tags, we choose the Cilin tags that 
more synsets map to. 
The above method is called a more restrictive 
scheme. An alternative method (called less 
restrictive method) is: all the Cilin tags that the 
neighboring synsets map to are selected. If 
Cilin tags cannot be found from neighboring 
synsets, we extend the range one more, and 
repeat the selection procedure again until all the 
syuseets are considered. 
4 Experiments 
4.1 Test Materials 
We sample documents of different categories 
from ASBC corpus, including philosophy (10%), 
science (10%), society (35%), art (5%), life 
(20%) and literary (20%). There are 35,921 
words in the test corpus. Research associates 
tag this corpus manually. At first, they mark 
up the ambiguous words by looking up the Cilin 
dictionary. Next, they tag the unknown words. 
A list of candidates i proposed by looking up 
the mapping table. Because the mapping table 
may have errors, the annotators assign a tag 
"none" when they cannot choose a solution from 
the proposed candidates. Total 435 of 1,979 
words are tagged with "none" with the more 
restrictive method. In contrast, only 346 words 
are labeled with "none" with the less restrictive 
method. The tag mapper achieves 82.52% of 
performance approximately. 
4.2 Tagging Ambiguous Words 
Table 5 shows the performance of tagging 
ambiguous words. MI defined in Section 3.1 is 
used. Total 11,101 words are tagged. The 
performance of tagging low, middle, and high 
ambiguous words are 62.60%, 31.36%, and 
27.00%, respectively. Table 6 shows that the 
performance is improved, in particular, the 
classes of middle- and high- ambiguity, when 
EM (defined in Section 3.1) is used. The 
overall performance is increased from 49.55% 
to 52.85%. 
In the previous experiments, only one sense is 
reported for each word. If we report more than 
one sense for middle and high ambiguous words, 
the performance is improved. Table 7 shows 
that the first 2 and 3 candidates are selected. 
From the diagonal of this table, the performance 
for tagging low ambiguity (2-4), middle 
ambiguity (5-8) and high ambiguity (>8) is 
similar (i.e., 63.98%, 60.92% and 67.95%) when 
1 candidate, 2 candidates, and 3 candidates are 
proposed, respectively. In this case, 7,034 of 
11,101 words are tagged correctly. That is, the 
performance is 63.36%. 
In the next experiment, we adopt middle 
categories (i.e., 94 categories) rather than the 
above small categories (i.e., 1428 categories). 
Table 8 shows that the overall performance is 
improved by 11.05%. It also lists the results 
with the combinations of first-n and middle 
categories. Under the middle categories and 
1-3 proposed candidates, the performance for 
tagging low, middle and high ambiguous words 
are 71.02%, 73.88%, and 75.94%, respectively. 
Total 8,033 of 11,101 words are tagged 
correctly. In other words, the performance is 
72.36%.

4.3 Tagging Unknown Words 
There are 1,979 unknown words in our test 
corpus. Total 1,663 words have been tagged 
manually. In the experiments, we consider the 
effects from training corpus and mapping table. 
Table 9 shows the performance. M1 and P1 
employ more restrictive mapping table, while 
M2 and P2 adopt less restrictive mapping table. 
M1 and M2 use the training result in Section 3.1 
(i.e., unambiguous words), while P1 and P2 
utilize the training result in Section 3.2 (i.e., 
unambiguous and ambiguous words). In the 
baseline model, all 1428 Cilin tags are the 
candidates of unknown words. The 
performance is worse. On the average, the 
precision is 1.22%. M1 is the best because 
more restrictive mapping table reduces the 
possibility of mapping errors. This table also 
lists the perforrnanee of each category. It 
meets our expectation, i.e., tagging verb is 
harder than tagging other categories. Next we 
use POS to improve the performance. POS 
narrows down the number of candidates, o that 
the overall performance is enhanced from 
27.13%% to 34.35%%. 
In summary, we consider the overall 
performance of tagging our sample data. 
Recall that there are 35,921 words in the test 
corpus. Except the stop words that are not 
tagged by the sense tagger, there remain 13,586 
unambiguous words, 11,101 ambiguous words, 
and 1,633 unknown words for tagging. From 
Tables 6 and 9, we know 5,867 unambiguous 
words and 561 unknown words are tagged 
correctly. The sense tagger achieves the 
performance of76.04%. 
5. Conclusion 
This paper analyzes the polysemy degree in 
Mandarin Chinese. We consider the 
distribution of word senses from POS and 
frequency. Under the Cilin small categories, 
23.67% of word types in ASBC corpus are

middle or high frequent words, but they occupy 
94.06% of word tokens. We adopt contextual 
information and mapping from WordNet synsets 
to Cilin sense tags to deal with this 
challengeable problem. The performances for 
tagging low, middle and high ambiguous words 
are 63.98%0, 60.92%, and 67.95% when small 
proposed. Comparatively, the performances 
categories are used and 1-3 candidates are 
71.02%, 73.88%, and 75.94% by using middle 
categories. The performance of tagging 
unknown words is 34.35%. It is worse than 
that of tagging ambiguous words, but is much 
better than that of the baseline mode. The 
overall performance is the sense tagger is 
76.04%. Although sense tagging does not 
achieve the performance of POS tagging, the 
sense tagger proposed in  this paper is still a 
useful computer-aided tool to reduce the human 
cost on tagging a large-scale corpus.
