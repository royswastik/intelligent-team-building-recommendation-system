Abstract
This paper investigates the combined use of
pause duration and pitch reset for automatic
story segmentation in Mandarin broadcast
news. Analysis shows that story boundaries
cannot be clearly discriminated from utterance
boundaries by speaker-normalized pitch reset
due to its large variations across different syl-
lable tone pairs. Instead, speaker- and tone-
normalized pitch reset can provide a clear sep-
aration between utterance and story bound-
aries. Experiments using decision trees for
story boundary detection reinforce that raw and
speaker-normalized pitch resets are not effec-
tive for Mandarin Chinese story segmentation.
Speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset is a
good story boundary indicator. When it is com-
bined with pause duration, a high F-measure
of 86.7% is achieved. Analysis of the decision
tree uncovered four major heuristics that show
how speakers jointly utilize pause duration and
pitch reset to separate speech into stories.
1 Introduction
Pitch reset refers to the speaker?s general pitch declina-
tion through the course of a speech unit, followed by a re-
set to a high pitch at the start of next speech unit, as shown
in Figure 1(a). The speech unit may be of different lev-
els of granularity (Tseng et. al., 2005), such as a speech
segment that conveys a central topic (e.g. a news story), a
prosodic phrase group (PG) or an utterance. These units
are often separated by pauses. Pauses and pitch resets
were shown to be effective story boundary indicators in
English broadcast news segmentation (Shriberg et. al.,
2000; Tu?r et. al., 2001). These previous efforts specifi-
cally point out that pause durations are longer and pitch
resets are more pronounced at story boundaries, when
compared to utterance boundaries in English broadcast
news. However, such story segmentation approaches may
be different for a tonal language such as Mandarin Chi-
nese. The use of similar prosodic features for Chinese
news story segmentation deserves further investigation.
The main reason is that Chinese tonal syllables may com-
plicate the expressions of pitch resets. Chinese syllable
tones are expressed acoustically in pitch trajectories, i.e,
different tones show different pitch value ranges and tra-
jectory patterns,1 as shown in Figure 1(b). Initial work in
(Levow, 2004) has shown that Mandarin words at story
ending positions show a lower pitch as compared with
words at non-story-ending positions. In this paper, we
present a data-oriented study to investigate how the tonal-
ity of Mandarin syllables affects pitch resets at utterance
and story boundaries. To alleviate the effects from tonal-
ity, we propose to use speaker- and tone-normalized pitch
reset with pause duration to separate Mandarin broadcast
audio stream into distinct news stories.

2 Task and Corpus
In a continuous audio stream of broadcast news, there are
programs that consist of speaker changes among anchors,
reporters and interviewees. Other programs may contain
a sequence of news stories reported by a single speaker.
We focus on the latter kind in this investigation, because
the combined use of pause duration and pitch reset to
punctuate the end of a story and the beginning of the next
carries many speaker-dependent characteristics.
We select a subset of TDT2 VOA Mandarin broadcast
news corpus (LDC, 1998) and manually extract the news
sessions reported by a single speaker. We also annotate

the news story boundaries in this subset. These single-
speaker sessions typically contain between 3 to 9 short
news stories separated by pauses and constitute about
30% of the entire TDT2 Mandarin corpus (by time du-
ration). The selected subset is divided into training, de-
velopment and testing sets. Details are shown in Table 1.
3 Region of Interest and Pitch Extraction
Previous work on English news segmentation (Shriberg
et. al., 2000) measured pitch resets at inter-word bound-
aries. Since Chinese news transcripts come as a charac-
ter stream and each character is pronounced as a tonal
syllable, it is more reasonable to investigate the pitch re-
set phenomenon at the syllable level. We assume that a
story boundary must occur at an utterance boundary. The
utterances are separated by labeled pauses in the VOA
transcriptions ([P] in Figure 2) and a story may contain
various utterances (between 2 to 38 in the corpus). There-
fore, we only investigate pitch resets in inter-syllable re-
gions across two consecutive utterances as shown in Fig-
ure 2. This is reasonable because there are only 6 story
boundaries (out of 1085) that are not signaled by pause
breaks in the corpus. The region of interest (ROI) is lim-
ited to only two tonal syllables, i.e., the last tonal syllable
of the previous utterance and the first tonal syllable of the
following utterance. We have performed experiments on
window length selection and results have shown a wider
window does not bring a noticeable improvement.
Raw pitch values are extracted by the YIN pitch
tracker (Cheveigne? et. al., 2002). The output pitch tra-
jectories are ranked as ?good? and ?best? by the pitch
tracker. Pitch values for unvoiced and pause segments are
assigned to be zero. We keep the ?best? pitch trajectories
for pitch reset measurements. We focus on pitch resets in
the ROIs and thus obtain pitch contours for the left and
right tonal syllables for each ROIs. However, the corpus
transcription does not provide time annotations for those
tonal syllables. Therefore, in the pitch trajectory of an

audio stream, we search forwards and backwards on both
sides of the pause segment for the nearest non-zero pitch
measurement sequences. The two pitch sequences found
are used as the pitch contours for the left and right tonal
syllables of the ROI, respectively. This approximation is
reasonable because a Mandarin tonal syllable usually ex-
hibits a continuous pitch contour within its time duration.
4 Speaker- and Tone-Normalized Pitch
Reset Analysis in Mandarin Broadcast
News
We investigate the pitch reset behavior in the ROIs, i.e.,
the pitch jump between the left and right tonal syllables
at utterance and story boundaries across all corpus audio.
Since pitch is a speaker-related feature, we adopt speaker-
normalized pitch reset, defined as
PR = F0r ? F0l, (1)
where F0l and F0r are the speaker-normalized pitch for
the left and right tonal syllables in the ROIs, which are
calculated using
F0 = (f0 ? ?sf0)/?sf0 . (2)f0 denotes the mean value of the pitch contour of a tonal
syllable uttered by speaker s. ?sf0 and ?sf0 are the pitch
mean and standard deviation calculated for speaker s over
all the ROIs of speaker s in the corpus.
We measure the speaker-normalized pitch resets in all
ROIs, and categorize them into two boundary types, i.e.
utterance boundary and story boundary. To show the ef-
fects of tonality in pitch movement, we also categorize
the pitch resets by different tone combinations (16 com-
binations for 4 Mandarin tones2). Figure 3 plots the mean
PR of each tone combinations for the two boundary
types calculated on the corpus data. We see that the pitch
reset phenomenon holds for all tone combinations, even
for the tone pair (1,3) (i.e. high, low) that has a very small
reset. We perform t-tests (p < 0.0025, one-tailed), which
show that for a given tone pair across a boundary, there
is a significant difference in PR between an utterance
boundary and a story boundary. However, the PR val-
ues vary greatly across different tone pairs. For example,

tern depends heavily on its neighboring tonal syllables.

pitch resets are reduced for the tone pairs (1,3) and (4,3),
but are pronounced for the tone pairs (3,1) and (2,1). The
t-test (p < 0.0025, one-tailed) shows that the PR differ-
ence between utterance boundaries and story boundaries
are not significant. This motivates us to formulate a defi-
nition for speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset.
The speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset is defined
as:
PR = F0r ?F0l, (3)
where F0l and F0r are the speaker- & tone-normalized
pitch for the left and right tonal syllables in the ROIs,
respectively, defined as
F0 = (F0 ? ??F0)/??F0 , (4)
where F0 is the speaker-normalized pitch in Equation (2)
of a tonal syllable with tone ? . ??F0 and ??F0 are the pitch
mean and standard deviation calculated for the tonal syl-
lables with tone ? over all ROIs in the corpus. Figure 4
plots the mean PR of each tone combinations for the two
boundary types calculated on the corpus data.
Figure 4 shows a clear separation in speaker- and tone-
normalized pitch reset (PR) between utterance and story
boundaries (shade area in Figure 4). This result is sta-
tistically significant based on a t-test (p < 0.0025, one-
tailed). This observation suggests that speaker- and tone-
normalized pitch reset may be an effective story boundary
indicator for Mandarin broadcast news.
5 Experiments on Story Boundary
Detection
We perform experiments on story boundary detection at
the ROIs in the corpus. Since all ROIs are utterance
boundaries, of which only some are story boundaries, we
take a ?hypothesize and classify? approach in order to
strike a good balance between recall and precision. We
first hypothesize the occurrence of a story boundary if
the ROI has a pause duration that exceeds a threshold.
This is followed by a decision tree classifier that decides
on the existence of a story boundary. We used Quinlan?s
C4.5-style decision tree (Quinlan, 1992) as the classifier,

implemented by the IND toolkit.3 The pause duration
threshold was selected by a heuristic search procedure
described as follows: We experimented with pause du-
rations ranging from 0.1 to 4 seconds with step size of
0.1 second. In each case, we hypothesized raw bound-
aries in the training and development sets. A decision tree
was then grown using the raw boundary hypotheses of the
training set, and tested on the raw boundary hypotheses
of the development set. The pause duration leading to the
highest F-measure on the development set was selected
as the optimal threshold for the further experiments on
the testing set.
We develop seven story boundary detectors according
to the features used (see Table 2). The boundary de-
tection results on the testing set are shown in Table 2.
From Table 2, we can see that the detector using pause
duration achieves a high F-measure of 82.2%. This re-
sult is reasonable since VOA Mandarin news broadcast
makes large use of long pauses at story boundaries, es-
pecially at news sessions reported by a single speaker.
The detector using raw pitch reset (pr = f0r?f0l) only
gets a F-measure of 50.8% and the speaker-normalized
pitch reset (PR) achieves a slightly better F-measure of
55.3%. Speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset (PR)
achieves a superior performance with an F-measure of
71.1%. This result is consistent with the observations
in Section 4. The story boundary indicative ability of
speaker-normalized pitch reset is affected by the tonal-
ity of Mandarin syllable. Speaker- and tone-normalized
pitch reset can alleviate the effects, thus leading to a bet-
ter discrimination. Based on Table 2, when pause is
combined with raw pitch reset, the F-measure degrades
from 82.2% to 68.3%. The F-measure reaches 77.4%
when we combine pause with speaker-normalized pitch
reset. When pause is combined with speaker- and tone-
normalized pitch reset (Pause+PR), the best F-measure
is achieved at 86.7%.

Figure 5 shows the top levels of the decision tree ob-

plementarity between pause duration and pitch reset in
story boundary detection. This may be summarized in
terms of four major heuristics shown on the tree (labeled
as 1 to 4 in Figure 5). These heuristics cover about 83%
decisions made on the testing set, as described in Table 3.
Heuristics 2 is mainly used to detect possibly miss-
ing story boundaries with short pauses caused by speaker
speaking style, e.g., reporters Li Weiqing and Yang Chen
tend to use short pauses to separate news stories, but they
tend to offset the reduced pauses with pronounced pitch
resets to signify story boundaries. Heuristics 4 detects
possibly false alarms due to broadcast interruptions in
boundary detection. These interruptions (i.e. silences)
usually occur within a news story and may last for sev-
eral seconds (usually > 5 seconds).
6 Summary and Future Work
This paper investigated the combined use of pause dura-
tion and pitch reset for automatic story segmentation in
Mandarin broadcast news. Pitch reset analysis on Man-
darin broadcast news shows that story boundaries cannot
be discriminated from utterance boundaries by speaker-
normalized pitch reset, because speaker-normalized pitch
reset varies greatly across different tone pairs of boundary
syllables. This motivates us to investigate the speaker-
and tone-normalized pitch reset. Analysis shows that
speaker- and tone-normalized pitch reset can clearly sep-

arate utterance boundaries from story boundaries across
all tone pairs. This result shows the difference be-
tween English and Chinese. Previous work for En-
glish (Shriberg et. al., 2000; Tu?r et. al., 2001) shows
that speaker-normalized pitch reset is effective. This
work shows that the same measurement is not sufficient
for Chinese; instead we need to use speaker- and tone-
normalized pitch reset in Chinese story segmentation.
When pause duration is combined with speaker- and tone-
normalized pitch reset, the best performance is achieved
with a high F-measure of 86.7%. Analysis of the deci-
sion tree uncovered four major heuristics that show how
speakers jointly utilize pause and pitch reset to separate
speech into stories.
Future work will investigate the pitch reset phe-
nomenon in Cantonese broadcast news, because Can-
tonese is another major Chinese dialect with more com-
plicated tonal characteristics. We also plan to incorporate
prosodic cues with lexical cues to further improve perfor-
mance in Chinese story segmentation.
