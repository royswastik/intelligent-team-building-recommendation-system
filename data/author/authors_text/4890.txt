Abstract
A maximum entropy classifier is used in
our semantic role labeling system, which
takes syntactic constituents as the labeling
units. The maximum entropy classifier is
trained to identify and classify the predi-
cates? semantic arguments together. Only
the constituents with the largest probabil-
ity among embedding ones are kept. Af-
ter predicting all arguments which have
matching constituents in full parsing trees,
a simple rule-based post-processing is ap-
plied to correct the arguments which have
no matching constituents in these trees.
Some useful features and their combina-
tions are evaluated.
1 Introduction
The semantic role labeling (SRL) is to assign syn-
tactic constituents with semantic roles (arguments)
of predicates (most frequently verbs) in sentences.
A semantic role is the relationship that a syntactic
constituent has with a predicate. Typical semantic
arguments include Agent, Patient, Instrument, etc.
and also adjunctive arguments indicating Locative,
Temporal, Manner, Cause, etc. It can be used in
lots of natural language processing application sys-
tems in which some kind of semantic interpretation
is needed, such as question and answering, informa-
tion extraction, machine translation, paraphrasing,
and so on.
?This research was supported by National Natural Science
Foundation of China via grant 60435020
Last year, CoNLL-2004 hold a semantic role la-
beling shared task (Carreras and Ma`rquez, 2004)
to test the participant systems? performance based
on shallow syntactic parser results. In 2005, SRL
shared task is continued (Carreras and Ma`rquez,
2005), because it is a complex task and now it is
far from desired performance.
In our SRL system, we select maximum en-
tropy (Berger et al, 1996) as a classifier to im-
plement the semantic role labeling system. Dif-
ferent from the best classifier reported in litera-
tures (Pradhan et al, 2005) ? support vector ma-
chines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1995), it is much eas-
ier for maximum entropy classifier to handle the
multi-class classification problem without additional
post-processing steps. The classifier is much faster
than training SVMs classifiers. In addition, max-
imum entropy classifier can be tuned to minimize
over-fitting by adjusting gaussian prior. Xue and
Palmer (2004; 2005) and Kwon et al (2004) have
applied the maximum entropy classifier to semantic
role labeling task successfully.
In the following sections, we will describe our
system and report our results on development and
test sets.
2 System Description
2.1 Constituent-by-Constituent
We use syntactic constituent as the unit of labeling.
However, it is impossible for each argument to find
its matching constituent in all auto parsing trees. Ac-
cording to statistics, about 10% arguments have no
matching constituents in the training set of 245,353
189
constituents. The top five arguments with no match-
ing constituents are shown in Table 1. Here, Char-
niak parser got 10.08% no matching arguments and
Collins parser got 11.89%.
Table 1: The top five arguments with no matching
constituents.
Args Cha parser Col parser Both
AM-MOD 9179 9205 9153
A1 5496 7273 3822
AM-NEG 3200 3217 3185
AM-DIS 1451 1482 1404
A0 1416 2811 925
Therefore, we can see that Charniak parser got a
better result than Collins parser in the task of SRL.
So we use the full analysis results created by Char-
niak parser as our classifier?s inputs. Assume that
we could label all AM-MOD and AM-NEG arguments
correctly with simple post processing rules, the up-
per bound of performance could achieve about 95%
recall.
At the same time, we can see that for some ar-
guments, both parsers got lots of no matchings such
as AM-MOD, AM-NEG, and so on. After analyzing
the training data, we can recognize that the perfor-
mance of these arguments can improve a lot after
using some simple post processing rules only, how-
ever other arguments? no matching are caused pri-
marily by parsing errors. The comparison between
using and not using post processing rules is shown
in Section 3.2.
Because of the high speed and no affection in the
number of classes with efficiency of maximum en-
tropy classifier, we just use one stage to label all ar-
guments of predicates. It means that the ?NULL?
tag of constituents is regarded as a class like ?ArgN?
and ?ArgM?.
2.2 Features
The following features, which we refer to as the
basic features modified lightly from Pradhan et
al. (2005), are provided in the shared task data for
each constituent.
? Predicate lemma
? Path: The syntactic path through the parse tree from the
parse constituent to the predicate.
? Phrase type
? Position: The position of the constituent with respect to
its predicate. It has two values, ?before? and ?after?,
for the predicate. For the situation of ?cover?, we use
a heuristic rule to ignore all of them because there is no
chance for them to become an argument of the predicate.
? Voice: Whether the predicate is realized as an active or
passive construction. We use a simple rule to recognize
passive voiced predicates which are labeled with part of
speech ? VBN and sequences with AUX.
? Head word stem: The stemming result of the con-
stituent?s syntactic head. A rule based stemming algo-
rithm (Porter, 1980) is used. Collins Ph.D thesis (Collins,
1999)[Appendix. A] describs some rules to identify the
head word of a constituent. Especially for prepositional
phrase (PP) constituent, the normal head words are not
very discriminative. So we use the last noun in the PP
replacing the traditional head word.
? Sub-categorization
We also use the following additional features.
? Predicate POS
? Predicate suffix: The suffix of the predicate. Here, we
use the last 3 characters as the feature.
? Named entity: The named entity?s type in the constituent
if it ends with a named entity. There are four types: LOC,
ORG, PER and MISC.
? Path length: The length of the path between a constituent
and its predicate.
? Partial path: The part of the path from the constituent
to the lowest common ancestor of the predicate and the
constituent.
? Clause layer: The number of clauses on the path between
a constituent and its predicate.
? Head word POS
? Last word stem: The stemming result of the last word of
the constituent.
? Last word POS
We also use some combinations of the above fea-
tures to build some combinational features. Lots of
combinational features which were supposed to con-
tribute the SRL task of added one by one. At the
same time, we removed ones which made the per-
formance decrease in practical experiments. At last,
we keep the following combinations:
? Position + Voice
? Path length + Clause layer
? Predicate + Path
? Path + Position + Voice
? Path + Position + Voice + Predicate
? Head word stem + Predicate
? Head word stem + Predicate + Path
? Head word stem + Phrase
? Clause layer + Position + Predicate
All of the features and their combinations are used
without feature filtering strategy.

2.3 Classifier
Le Zhang?s Maximum Entropy Modeling Toolkit 1,
and the L-BFGS parameter estimation algorithm
with gaussian prior smoothing (Chen and Rosenfeld,
1999) are used as the maximum entropy classifier.
We set gaussian prior to be 2 and use 1,000 itera-
tions in the toolkit to get an optimal result through
some comparative experiments.
2.4 No Embedding
The system described above might label two con-
stituents even if one embeds in another, which is not
allowed by the SRL rule. So we keep only one ar-
gument when more arguments embedding happens.
Because it is easy for maximum entropy classifier to
output each prediction?s probability, we can label the
constituent which has the largest probability among
the embedding ones.
2.5 Post Processing Stage
After labeling the arguments which are matched
with constituents exactly, we have to handle the ar-
guments, such as AM-MOD, AM-NEG and AM-DIS,
which have few matching with the constituents de-
scribed in Section 2.1. So a post processing is given
by using some simply rules:
? Tag target verb and successive particles as V.
? Tag ?not? and ?n?t? in target verb chunk as AM-NEG.
? Tag modal verbs in target verb chunk, such as words with
POS of ?MD?, ?going to?, and so on, as AM-MOD.
? Tag the words with POS of ?CC? and ?RB? at the start of
a clause which include the target verb as AM-DIS.
3 Experiments
3.1 Data and Evaluation Metrics
The data provided for the shared task is a part of
PropBank corpus. It consists of the sections from
the Wall Street Journal part of Penn Treebank. Sec-
tions 02-21 are training sets, and Section 24 is devel-
opment set. The results are evaluated for precision,
recall and F?=1 numbers using the srl-eval.pl script
provided by the shared task organizers.
3.2 Post Processing
After using post processing rules, the final F?=1 is
improved from 71.02% to 75.27%.

3.3 Performance Curve
Because the training corpus is substantially en-
larged, this allows us to test the scalability of
learning-based SRL systems to large data set and
compute learning curves to see how many data are
necessary to train. We divide the training set, 20
sections Penn Treebank into 5 parts with 4 sections
in each part. There are about 8,000 sentences in each
part. Figure 1 shows the change of performance as
a function of training set size. When all of training
data are used, we get the best system performance as
described in Section 3.4.
Figure 1: Our SRL system performance curve (of
F?=1) effecting of the training set size.
We can see that as the training set becomes larger
and larger, so does the performance of SRL system.
However, the rate of increase slackens. So we can
say that at present state, the larger training data has
favorable effect on the improvement of SRL system
performance.
3.4 Best System Results
In all the experiments, all of the features and their
combinations described above are used in our sys-
tem. Table 2 presents our best system performance
on the development and test sets.
From the test results, we can see that our system
gets much worse performance on Brown corpus than
WSJ corpus. The reason is easy to be understood
for the dropping of automatic syntactic parser per-
formance on new corpus but WSJ corpus.
The training time on PIV 2.4G CPU and 1G Mem
machine is about 20 hours on all 20 sections, 39,832-

4 Conclusions
We have described a maximum entropy classifier
is our semantic role labeling system, which takes
syntactic constituents as the labeling units. The
fast training speed of the maximum entropy clas-
sifier allows us just use one stage of arguments
identification and classification to build the system.
Some useful features and their combinations are
evaluated. Only the constituents with the largest
probability among embedding ones are kept. Af-
ter predicting all arguments which have matching
constituents in full parsing trees, a simple rule-
based post-processing is applied to correct the ar-
guments which have no matching constituents. The
constituent-based method depends much on the syn-
tactic parsing performance. The comparison be-
tween WSJ and Brown test sets results fully demon-
strates the point of view.
