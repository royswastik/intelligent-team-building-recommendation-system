Abstract
We discuss Image Sense Discrimination
(ISD), and apply a method based on spec-
tral clustering, using multimodal features
from the image and text of the embedding
web page. We evaluate our method on a
new data set of annotated web images, re-
trieved with ambiguous query terms. Ex-
periments investigate different levels of
sense granularity, as well as the impact of
text and image features, and global versus
local text features.
1 Introduction and problem clarification
Semantics extends beyond words. We focus on im-
age sense discrimination (ISD)1 for web images
retrieved from ambiguous keywords, given a mul-
timodal feature set, including text from the doc-
ument which the image was embedded in. For
instance, a search for CRANE retrieves images of
crane machines, crane birds, associated other ma-
chinery or animals etc., people, as well as images
of irrelevant meanings. Current displays for im-
age queries (e.g. Google or Yahoo!) simply list
retrieved images in any order. An application is
a user display where images are presented in se-
mantically sensible clusters for improved image
browsing. Another usage of the presented model
is automatic creation of sense discriminated image
data sets, and determining available image senses
automatically.
ISD differs from word sense discrimination and
disambiguation (WSD) by increased complexity
in several respects. As an initial complication,
both word and iconographic sense distinctions

tion in NLP.
matter. Whereas a search term like CRANE can
refer to, e.g. a MACHINE or a BIRD; iconographic
distinctions could additionally include birds stand-
ing, vs. in a marsh land, or flying, i.e. sense-
distinctions encoded by further descriptive modi-
fication in text. Therefore, as the number of text
senses grow with corpus size, the iconographic
senses grow even faster, and enumerating icono-
graphic senses is extremely challenging; espe-
cially since dictionary senses do not capture icono-
graphic distinctions. Thus, we focus on image-
driven word senses for ISD, but we acknowledge
the importance of iconography for visual meaning.
Also, an image often depicts a related mean-
ing. E.g. a picture retrieved for SQUASH may
depict a squash bug (i.e. an insect on a leaf of
a squash plant) instead of a squash vegetable,
whereas this does not really apply in WSD, where
each instance concerns the ambiguous term itself.
Therefore, it makes sense to consider the divi-
sion between core sense, related sense, and un-
related sense in ISD, and, as an additional com-
plication, their boundaries are often blurred. Most
importantly, whereas the one-sense-per-discourse
assumption (Yarowsky, 1995) also applies to dis-
criminating images, there is no guarantee of
a local collocational or co-occurrence context
around the target image. Design or aesthetics may
instead determine image placement. Thus, con-
sidering local text around the image may not be as
helpful as local context is for standard WSD. In
fact, the query term may even not occur in the
text body. On the other hand, one can assume that
an image spotlights the web page topic and that it
highlights important document information. Also,
images mostly depict concrete senses. Lastly, ISD
from web data is complicated by web pages being
more domain-independent than news wire, the fa-

vored corpus for WSD. As noted by (Yanai and
Barnard, 2005), whereas current image retrieval
engines include many irrelevant images, a data set
of web images gives a more real-world point of
departure for image recognition.
Outline Section 2 discusses the corpus data and
image annotation. Section 3 presents the feature
set and the clustering model. Subsequently, sec-
tion 4 introduces the evaluation used, and dis-
cusses experimental work and results. In section
5, this work is positioned with respect to previous
work. We conclude with an outline of plans for
future work in section 6.
2 Data and annotation
Yahoo!?s image query API was used to obtain a
corpus of pairs of semantically ambiguous images,
in thumbnail and true size, and their correspond-
ing web sites for three ambiguous keywords in-
spired by (Yarowsky, 1995): BASS, CRANE, and
SQUASH. We apply query augmentation (cf. Ta-
ble 1), and exact duplicates were filtered out by
identical image URLs, but cases occurred where
both thumbnail and true-size image were included.
Also, some images shared the same webpage or
came from the same site. Generally, the lat-
ter gives important information about shared dis-
course topic, however the images do not necessar-
ily depict the same sense (e.g. a CRANE bird vs.
a meadow), and image features can separate them
into different clusters.
Annotation overview The images were anno-
tated with one of several labels by one of the au-
thors out of context (without considering the web
site and its text), after applying text-based filter-
ing (cf. section 3.1). For annotation purposes, im-
ages were numbered and displayed on a web page
in thumbnail size. In case the thumbnail was not
sufficient for disambiguation, the image linked at
its true size to the thumbnail was inspected.2 The
true-size view depended on the size of the orig-
inal picture and showed the image and its name.
However, the annotator tried to resist name influ-
ence, and make judgements based just on the im-
age. For each query, 2 to 4 core word senses (e.g.
squash vegetable and squash sport for SQUASH)
were distinguished from inspecting the data. How-
ever, because ?context? was restricted to the image
content, and there was no guarantee that the image
actually depicts the query term, additional anno-
tator senses were introduced. Thus, for most core
senses, a RELATED label was included, accounting
for meanings that seemed related to core meaning
but lacked a core sense object in the image. Some
examples for RELATED senses are in Fig. 1. In ad-
dition, for each query term, a PEOPLE label was
included because such images are common due to
the nature of how people take pictures (e.g. por-
traits of persons or group pictures of crowds, when
core or related senses did not apply), as was an

nail image different from the true size image.

Table 1: Web images for three ambiguous query terms were annotated manually out of context (without considering the
web page document). For each term, the number of annotated images, the query retrieval terms, the senses, their distribution,
and rough sample annotation guidelines are provided, with core senses marked in bold face. Because image retrieval engines
restrict hits to 1000 images, query expansion was conducted by adding narrowing query terms from askjeeves.com to
increase corpus size. We selected terms relevant to core senses, i.e. the main discrimination phenomenon.
UNRELATED label for irrelevant images which did
not fit other labels or were undeterminable.
For a human annotator, even when using more
natural word senses, assigning sense labels to im-
ages based on image alone is more challenging
and subjective than labeling word senses in tex-
tual context. First of all, the annotation is heav-
ily dependent on domain-knowledge and it is not
feasible for a layperson to recognize fine-grained
semantics. For example, it is straightforward for
the layperson to distinguish between a robin and a
crane, but determining whether a given fish should
have the common name bass applied to it, or
whether an instrument is indeed a bass instrument
or not, is extremely difficult (see Fig. 2; e.g. de-
ciding if a picture of a fish fillet is a picture of a
fish is tricky). Furthermore, most images display
objects only partially; for example just the neck
of a classical double bass instead of the whole in-
strument. In addition, scaling, proportions, and
components are key cues for object discrimina-
tion in real-life, e.g. for singling out an electric
bass from an electric guitar, but an image may
not provide these detail. Thus, senses are even
fuzzier for ISD than WSD labeling. Given that
laypeople are in the majority, it is fair to assume
their perspective and naiveness. This latter fact
also led to annotations? level of specificity differ-
ing according to search term. Annotation criteria
depended on the keyword term and its senses and
their coverage, as shown in Table 1. Neverthe-
less, several border-line cases for label assignment
occurred. Considering that the annotation task is

quite subjective, this is to be expected. In fact,
one person?s labeling often appears as justifiable
as a contradicting label provided by another per-
son. We explore the vagueness and subjective na-
ture of image annotation further in a companion
paper (Alm, Loeff, Forsyth, 2006).
3 Model
Our goal is to provide a mapping between im-
ages and a set of iconographically coherent clus-
ters for a given query word, in an unsupervised
framework. Our approach involves extracting
and weighting unordered bags-of-words (BOWs;
henceforth) features from the webpage text, sim-
ple local and global features from the image, and
running spectral clustering on top. Fig. 3 shows an
overview of the implementation.
549
3.1 Feature extraction
Document and text filtering A pruning process
was used to filter out image-document pairs based
on e.g. language specification, exclusion of ?In-
dex of? pages, pages lacking an extractable target
image, or a cutoff threshold of number of tokens
in the body. For remaining documents, text was
preprocessed (e.g. lower-casing, removing punc-
tuation, tokens being very short, having numbers
or no vowels, etc.). We used a stop word list, but
avoided stemming to make the algorithm language
independent in other respects. When using image
features, grayscale images (no color histograms)
and images without salient regions (no keypoints
detected) were also removed.
Text features We used the following BOWs:
(a) tokens in the page body; (b) tokens in a ?10
window around the target image (if multiple, the
first was considered); (c) tokens in a ?10 window
around any instances of the query keyword (e.g.
squash); (d) tokens of the target image?s alt at-
tribute; (e) tokens of the title tag; (f) some meta
tokens.3 Tf-idf was applied to a weighted aver-
age of the BOWs. Webpage design is flexible, and
some inconsistencies and a certain degree of noise
remained in the text features.
Image features Given the large variability in
the retrieved image set for a given query, it is dif-
ficult to model images in an unsupervised fash-
ion. Simple features have been shown to provide
performance rivaling that of more elaborate mod-
els in object recognition (Csurka et al 2004) and
(Chapelle, Haffner, and Vapnik, 1999), and the
following image bags of features were considered:
Bags of keypoints: In order to obtain a compact
representation of the textures of an image, patches
are extracted automatically around interesting re-
gions or keypoints in each image. The keypoint
detection algorithm (Kadir and Brady, 2001) uses
a saliency measure based on entropy to select re-
gions. After extraction, keypoints were repre-
sented by a histogram of gradient magnitude of
the pixel values in the region (SIFT) (Lowe, 2004).
These descriptors were clustered using a Gaussian
Mixture with ? 300 components, and the result-
ing global patch codebook (i.e. histogram of code-
book entries) was used as lookup table to assign
each keypoint to a codebook entry.
3Adding to META content, keywords was an attribute, but
is irregular. Embedded BODY pairs are rare; thus not used.
Color histograms: Due to its similarity to
how humans perceive color, HSV (hue, saturation,
brightness) color space was used to bin pixel color
values for each image. Eight bins were used per
channel, obtaining an 83 dimensional vector.
3.2 Measuring similarity between images
For the BOWs text representation, we use the com-
mon measure of cosine similarity (cs) of two tf-
idf vectors (Jurafsky and Martin, 2000). The co-
sine similarity measure is also appropriate for key-
point representation as it is also an unordered bag.
There are several measures for histogram compar-
ison (i.e. L1, ?2). As in (Fowlkes et al 2004) we
use the ?2 distance measure between histograms

3.3 Spectral Clustering
Spectral clustering is a powerful way to sepa-
rate non-convex groups of data. Spectral meth-
ods for clustering are a family of algorithms that
work by first constructing a pairwise-affinity ma-
trix from the data, computing an eigendecomposi-
tion of the data, embedding the data into this low-
dimensional manifold, and finally applying tradi-
tional clustering techniques (i.e. k-means) to it.
Consider a graph with a set of n vertices each
one representing an image document, and the
edges of the graph represent the pairwise affinities
between the vertices. Let W be an n?n symmet-
ric matrix of pairwise affinities. We define these
as the Gaussian-weighted distance
Wij = exp
(
??t(1? csti,j)? ?
k(1? cski,j)? ?
c?2i,j
)
,
(2)
where {?t, ?k, ?c} are scaling parameters for text,
keypoints, and color features.
It has been shown that the use of multiple eigen-
vectors of W is a valid space onto which the data
can be embedded (Ng, Jordan, Weiss, 2002). In
this space noise is reduced while the most signif-
icant affinities are preserved. After this, any tra-
ditional clustering algorithm can be applied in this
new space to get the final clusters. Note that this
is a nonlinear mapping of the original space. In
particular, we employ a variant of k-means, which
includes a selective step that is quasi-optimal in
a Vector Quantization sense (Ueda and Nakano,
1994). It has the added advantage of being more
550
robust to initialization than traditional k-means.
The algorithm follows,
1. For given documents, compute the affinity
matrix W as defined in equation 2.
2. Let D be a diagonal matrix whose (i, i)-th
element is the sum of W ?s i-th row, and de-
fine L = D?1/2WD?1/2.
3. Find the k largest eigenvectors V of L.
4. Define E as V , with normalized rows.
5. Perform clustering on the columns of E,
which represent the embedding of each im-
age into the new space, using a selective step
as in (Ueda and Nakano, 1994).
Why Spectral Clustering? Why apply a vari-
ant of k-means in the embedded space as opposed
to the original feature space? The k-means algo-
rithm cannot separate non-convex clusters. Fur-
thermore, it is unable to cope with noisy dimen-
sions (this is especially true in the case of the text
data) and highly non-ellipsoid clusters. (Ng, Jor-
dan, Weiss, 2002) stated that spectral clustering
outperforms k-means not only on these high di-
mensional problems, but also in low-dimensional,
multi-class data sets. Moreover, there are prob-
lems where Euclidean measures of distance re-
quired by k-means are not appropriate (for in-
stance histograms), or others where there is not
even a natural vector space representation. Also,
spectral clustering provides a simple way of com-
bining dissimilar vector spaces, like in this case
text, keypoint and color features.
4 Experiments and results
In the first set of experiments, we used all features
for clustering. We considered three levels of sense
granularity: (1) all senses (All), (2) merging re-
lated senses with their corresponding core sense
(Meta), (3) just the core senses (Core). For ex-
periments (1) and (2), we used 40 clusters and all
labeled images. For (3), we considered only im-
ages labeled with core senses, and thus reduced the
number of clusters to 20 for a more fair compari-
son. Results were evaluated according to global
cluster purity, cf. Equation 3.4

fined as images whose ratio of distances to the second closest
and closest clusters was below a threshold.

Table 2 shows that purity was surprisingly good,
stable across query terms, and that it was high-
est when only core sense data was considered. In
addition, purity tended to be slightly higher for
BASS, which may be related to the annotator being
less confident about its fine-grained sense distinc-
tions, and thus less strict for assigning core sense
labels for this query term.5 In addition, we looked
at the relative performance of individual global
and local features using 20 clusters and only core

sense data based on a particular feature. Table 3
shows that global text features were most infor-
mative (although not homogenously), but also that
each feature type performed better than the base-
line in isolation. This indicates that an optimal fea-
ture combination may improve over current per-
formance, using manually selected parameters. In
addition, purity is not the whole story. Figs. 4
and 5 show examples of two selected interesting
clusters obtained for CRANE and SQUASH, respec-
tively, using combined image and text features and
all individual senses.6 Inspection of image clus-

tribute to more visually balanced clusters, espe-
cially in terms of colors and shading. This shows
that further exploring image features may be vi-
tal for attaining more subtle iconographic senses.
Moreover, as discussed in the introduction, images
are not necessarily anchored in the immediate text
which they refer to. This could explain why lo-
cal text features do not perform as well as global
ones. Lastly, in addition, Fig. 6 shows an example
of a partial cluster where the algorithm inferred a
specific related sense.

clusters for BASS. The results are in Table 4, lack-

clusters (Schu?tze, 1998), but may be due to the
spectral clustering. Inspection showed that 6 clus-
ters were dominated by core senses, whereas with
40 clusters a few were also dominated by RE-
LATED senses or PEOPLE. No cluster was domi-
nated by an UNRELATED label, which makes sense
since semantic linkage should be absent between
unrelated items.
5 Comparison to previous work
Space does not allow a complete review of the
WSD literature. (Yarowsky, 1995) demonstrated
that semi-supervised WSD could be successful.
(Schu?tze, 1998) and (Lin and Pantel, 2002a, b)
show that clustering methods are helpful in this
area.
While ISD has received less attention, image
categorization has been approached previously
by adding text features. For example, (Frankel,
Swain, and Athitsos, 1996)?s WebSeer system
attempted to mutually distinguish photos, hand-
drawn, and computer-drawn images, using a com-
bination of HTML markup, web page text, and im-
age information. (Yanai and Barnard, 2005) found
that adding text features could benefit identifying
relevant web images. Using text-annotated images
(i.e. images annotated with relevant keywords),
(Barnard and Forsyth, 2001) clustered them ex-
ploring a semantic hierarchy; similarly (Barnard,
Duygulu, and Forsyth, 2002) conducted art clus-
tering, and (Barnard and Johnson, 2005) used text-
annotated images to improve WSD. The latter pa-
per obtained best results when combining text and
image features, but contrary to our findings, im-
age features performed better in isolation than just
text. They did use a larger set of image features
and segmentation, however, we suspect that dif-
ferences can rather be attributed to corpus type. In
fact, (Yanai, Shirahatti, and Barnard, 2005) noted
that human evaluators rated images obtained via
a keyword retrieval method higher compared to
image-based retrieval methods, which they relate
to the importance of semantics for what humans
regard as matching, and because pictorial seman-
tics is hard to detect.
(Cai et al 2004) use similar methods to rank
visual search results. While their work does not
focus explicitly on sense and does not provide in-
depth discussion of visual sense phenomena, these
do appear in, for example, figs. 7 and 9 of their pa-
per. An interesting aspect of their work is the use
of page layout segmentation to associate text with
images in web documents. Unfortunately, the au-
553
thors only provide an illustrative query example,
and no numerical evaluation, making any com-
parison difficult. (Wang et al 2004) use similar
features with the goal to improve image retrieval
through similarity propagation, querying specific
web sites. (Fuji and Ishikawa, 2005) deal with
image ambiguity for establishing an online mul-
timedia encyclopedia, but their method does not
integrate image features, and appears to depend
on previous encyclopedic background knowledge,
limited to a domain set.
6 Conclusion
It is remarkable how high purity is, considering
that we are using relatively simple image and text
representation. In most corpora used to date for re-
search on illustrated text, word sense is an entirely
secondary phenomenon, whereas our data set was
collected as to emphasize possible ambiguities as-
sociated with word sense. Our results suggest that
a surprisingly degree of the meaning of an illus-
trated object is exposed on the surface.
This work is an initial attempt at addressing
the ISD problem. Future work will involve learn-
ing the algorithm?s parameters without supervi-
sion, and develop a semantically meaningful im-
age taxonomy. In particular, we intend to explore
the notion of iconographic senses; surprisingly
good results on image classification by (Chapelle,
Haffner, and Vapnik, 1999) using image features
suggest that iconography plays an important role
in the semantics of images. An important aspect
is to enhance our understanding of the interplay
between text and image features for this purpose.
Also, it remains an unsolved problem how to enu-
merate iconographic senses, and use them in man-
ual annotation and classification. Experimental
work with humans performing similar tasks may
provide increased insight into this issue, and can
also be used to validate clustering performance.

Abstract
We describe an unusual data set of thou-
sands of annotated images with interest-
ing sense phenomena. Natural language
image sense annotation involves increased
semantic complexities compared to dis-
ambiguating word senses when annotating
text. These issues are discussed and illus-
trated, including the distinction between
word senses and iconographic senses.
1 Introduction
We describe a set of annotated images, each asso-
ciated with a sense of a small set of words. Build-
ing this data set exposes important sense phenom-
ena which not only involve natural language but
also vision. The context of our work is Image
Sense Discrimination (ISD), where the task is to
assign one of several senses to a web image re-
trieved by an ambiguous keyword. A compan-
ion paper introduces the task, presents an unsuper-
vised ISD model, drawing on web page text and
image features, and shows experimental results
(Loeff et al, 2006). The data was subject to single-
annotator labeling, with verification judgements
on a part of the data set as a step toward study-
ing agreement. Besides a test bed for ISD, the
data set may be applicable to e.g. multimodal word
sense disambiguation and cross-language image
retrieval. The issues discussed concern concepts,
and involve insights into semantics, perception,
and knowledge representation, while opening up a
bridge for interdisciplinary work involving vision
and NLP.
2 Related work
The complex relationship between annotations
and images has been explored by the library com-
munity, who study management practices for im-
age collections, and by the computer vision com-
munity, who would like to provide automated im-
age retrieval tools and possibly learn object recog-
nition methods.
Commercial picture collections are typically an-
notated by hand, e.g. (Enser, 1993; Armitage and
Enser, 1997; Enser, 2000). Subtle phenomena can
make this very difficult, and content vs. interpreta-
tion may differ; an image of the Eiffel tower could
be annotated with Paris or even love, e.g. (Ar-
mitage and Enser, 1997), and the resulting annota-
tions are hard to use, cf. (Markkula and Sormunen,
2000), or Enser?s result that a specialized indexing
language gives only a ?blunt pointer to regions of
the Hulton collections?, (Enser, 1993), p. 35.
Users of image collections have been well stud-
ied. Important points for our purposes are: Users
request images both by object kinds, and individ-
ual identities; users request images both by what
they depict and by what they are about; and that
text associated with images is extremely useful in
practice, newspaper archivists indexing largely on
captions (Markkula and Sormunen, 2000).
The computer vision community has stud-
ied methods to predict annotations from images,
e.g. (Barnard et al, 2003; Jeon et al, 2003; Blei
and Jordan, 2002). The annotations that are pre-
dicted most successfully tend to deal with ma-
terials whose identity can be determined without
shape analysis, like sky, sea and the like. More
complex annotations remain difficult. There is no
current theory of word sense in this context, be-
cause in most current collections, words appear in
the most common sense only. Sense is known to
be important, and image information can disam-
biguate word senses (Barnard and Johnson, 2005).

3 Data set
The data set has images retrieved from a web
search engine. We deliberately focused on three
keywords, which cover a range of phenomena in
semantic ambiguity: BASS, CRANE, and SQUASH.
Table 1 gives an overview of the data set, anno-
tated by one author (CA).1 The webpage was not
considered to avoid bias, given the ISD task.
For each query, 2 to 4 core word senses were
distinguished from inspecting the data using com-
mon sense. We chose this approach rather than
ontology senses which tend to be incomplete or
too specific for our purposes. For example, the
origami sense of CRANE is not included in Word-
Net under CRANE, but for BASS three different
senses appear with fish. WordNet contains bird
as part of the description for the separate entry
origami, and some query expansion terms are hy-
ponyms which occur as separate WordNet entries
(e.g. bass guitar, sea bass, summer squash). Im-
ages may show multiple objects; a general strategy
preferred a core sense if it was included.
An additional complication is that given that the
images are retrieved by a search engine there is no
guarantee that they depict the query term, so ad-
ditional senses were introduced. Thus, for most

at http://www.visionpc.cs.uiuc.edu/isd/.
core senses, a RELATED label was included for
meanings related to the semantic field of a core
sense. Also, a PEOPLE label was included since
such images may occur due to how people take
pictures (e.g. portraits of persons, group pictures,
or other representations of people outside core and
related senses). An UNRELATED label accounted
for images that did not fit other labels, or were ir-
relevant or undeterminable. In fact, distinguish-
ing between PEOPLE and UNRELATED was not al-
ways straightforward. Fig. 1 shows examples of
CRANE when sense assignment was quite straight-
forward. However, distinguishing image senses
was often not this clear. In fact, many border-line
cases occurred when one could argue for different
label assignments. Also, annotation cues are sub-
ject to interpretation, and disagreements between
judges are expected. They simply reflect that im-
age senses are located on a semantic continuum.
4 Why annotating image senses is hard
In general, annotating images involves special
challenges, such as what to annotate and how ex-
tensively. We assign an image one sense. Never-
theless, compared to disambiguating a word, sev-
eral issues are added for annotation. As noted
above, a core sense may not occur, and judge-
ments are characterized by increased subjectivity,
with semantics beyond prototypical and peripheral

exemplars. Also, the disambiguating context is
limited to image contents, rather than collocations
of an ambiguous token. Fig. 2 illustrates selected
challenging judgement calls for assigning or not
the bird sense of CRANE, as discussed below.
Depiction: Images may include man-made de-
pictions of an object in artistic depictions, and the
question is whether this counts as the object or
not, e.g. Fig. 2(a-c). Gradient changes: Recog-
nition is complicated by objects taking different
forms and shapes, cf. the insight by (Labov, 1973)
on gradual categories.2 For example, as seen in
Fig. 2(d-f), birds change with age; an egg may be
a bird, but a chick is, as is a fledgeling. Partial
display: Objects may be rendered in incomplete
condition. For example, Fig. 2(g-h) show merely
feathers or a bird neck. Domain knowledge: Peo-
ple may disagree due to differences in domain
knowledge, e.g. some non-experts may have a dif-
ficult time determining whether or not other sim-
ilar bird species can be distinguished from a bird
crane, cf. Fig. 2(i-j). This also affected annota-
tions? granularity depending on keyword, see Ta-
ble 1?s example cues. Unusual appearance: Ob-
jects may occur in less frequent visual appear-
ance, or lack distinguishing properties. For in-
stance, Fig. 2(k) illustrates how sunset background
masks birds? color information. Scale: The dis-
tance to objects may render them unclear and in-
fluence judgement accuracy, and people may dif-
fer in the degree of certainty required for assign-
ing a sense. For example, Fig. 2(l-n) show flying
or standing potential cranes at distance. Animate:
Fig. 2(o-q) raise the question whether dead, skele-
tal, or artificial objects are instantiations or not.
Other factors complicating the annotation task in-
clude image crowdedness disguising objects, cer-
tain entities having less salience, and lacking or
unclear reference to object proportions. Senses
2Function or properties may also influence (Labov, 1973).
may also be etymologically related or blend occa-
sionally, or be guided by cultural interpretations,
and so on.
Moreover, related senses are meant to capture
images associated with the semantic field of a core
sense. However, because the notion and borders of
a semantic field are non-specific, related senses
are tricky. Annotators may build associations
quite wildly, based on personal experience and
opinion, thus what is or is not a related sense may
very quickly get out of hand. For instance, a per-
son may by association reason that if bird cranes
occur frequently in fields, then an image of a field
alone should be marked as related. To avoid this,
guidelines attempted to restrict related senses, as
exemplified in Table 1, with some data-driven re-
visions during the annotation process. However,
guidelines are also based on judgement calls. Be-
sides, for abstract concepts like LOVE, differenti-
ating core versus related sense is not really valid.
Lastly, an additional complexity of image
senses is that in addition to traditional word
senses, images may also capture repeatedly oc-
curring iconographic patterns or senses. As illus-
trated in Fig. 3, the iconography of flying cranes
is quite different from that of standing cranes, as
regards motion, shape, identity, and color of figure
and ground, respectively. Mixed cases also occur,
e.g. when bird cranes are taking off or are about
to land in relation to flight. Iconographic senses
may compare to more complex linguistic struc-
tures than nominal categories, e.g. a modified NP
or clause, but are represented by image properties.
A policy for annotating iconographic senses is
still lacking. Image groups based on iconographic
senses seem to provide increased visual and se-
mantic harmony for the eye, but experiments are
needed to confirm how iconographic senses cor-
respond to humans? perception of semantic image
similarity, and at what level of semantic differen-

tiation they become relevant for sense assessment.
Lastly, considering the challenges of image an-
notation, it is interesting to look at annotation dis-
agreements. Thus, another author (NL) inspected
CRANE annotations, and recorded disagreement
candidates, which amounted to 5%. Rejecting or
accepting a category label seems less hard than
independent annotation but still can give insights
into disagreement tendencies. Several disagree-
ments involved a core category vs. its related label
vs. unrelated, rather than two core senses. Also,
some disagreement candidates had tiny, fuzzy,
partial or peripheral potential sense objects, or
lacked distinguishing object features, so interpre-
tation became quite idiosyncratic. The disagree-
ment candidates were discussed together, result-
ing in 2% being true disagreements, 2% false dis-
agreements (resolved by consensus on CA?s la-
bels), and 1% annotation mistakes. Examples of
true disagreements are in Fig. 4. Often, both par-
ties could see each others? points, but opted for an-
other interpretation; this confirms that border lines
tend to merge, indicating that consistency is chal-
lenging and not always guaranteed. As the annota-
tion procedure advances, criteria may evolve and
modify the fuzzy sense boundaries.
5 Conclusion
This work draws attention to the need for consid-
ering natural language semantics in multi-modal
settings. Annotating image senses adds increased
complexity compared to word-sense annotation
in text due to factors such as image proper-
ties, subjective perception, and annotator domain-
knowledge. Moreover, the concept of related
senses as well as iconographic senses go beyond
and diversify the notion of word sense. In the fu-
ture, we would like to perform experimentation
with human subjects to explore both similarity
judgements for image pairs or groups, as well as
issues in interannotator agreement for image dis-
ambiguation, and, finally, to better understand the
role of iconography for semantic interpretation.
