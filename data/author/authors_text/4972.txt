Abstract 
We propose that machine translation (MT) is a 
useful application for evaluating and deriving 
the development of NL components, 
especially in a wide-coverage analysis system. 
Given the architecture of our MT system, 
which is a transfer system based on linguistic 
modules, correct analysis is expected to be a 
prerequisite for correct translation, suggesting 
a correlation between the two, given relatively 
mature transfer and generation components.  
We show through error analysis that there is 
indeed a strong correlation between the quality 
of the translated output and the subjectively 
determined goodness of the analysis.  We use 
this correlation as a guide for development of 
a coordinated parallel analysis effort in 7 
languages. 
1  Introduction 
The question of how to test natural language 
analysis systems has been central to all natural 
language work in the past two decades.  It is a 
difficult question, for which researchers have 
found only partial answers.  The most common 
answer is component testing, where the component 
is compared against a standard of goodness, 
usually the Penn Treebank for English (Marcus et 
al., 1993),  allowing a numerical score of precision 
and recall (e.g. Collins, 1997). 
 Such methods have limitations, however, and 
need to be supplemented by additional methods.  
One limitation is the availability of annotated 
corpora, which do not exist for all languages.  
Secondly, comparison to an annotated corpus can 
only measure how well a system produces the kind 
of analysis for which the corpus is annotated, e.g. 
labeled bracketing of surface syntax.  Evaluation 
of analysis of deeper, more semantically 
descriptive, levels requires additional annotated 
corpora, which may not exist.  A more 
fundamental limitation of such methods is that 
they measure the goodness of a grammar without 
taking into account what the grammar is good for.  
This limitation is overcome, we claim, only by 
measuring the goodness of a grammar by its 
success in real-world applications. 
 We propose that machine translation (MT) is a 
good application to evaluate and drive the 
development of analysis components when the 
transfer component is based on linguistic modules.  
Multi-lingual applications such as MT allow 
evaluation of system components that overcomes 
the limitations mentioned above, and therefore 
serves as a useful complement to other evaluation 
techniques.  Another significant advantage to 
using MT as a testbed for the analysis system is 
that it prioritizes analysis problems, highlighting 
those problems that have the greatest negative 
effect on translation output. 
 In this paper, we give an overview of 
NLPWin, a multi-application natural language 
analysis and generation system under development 
at Microsoft Research (Jensen et al, 1993; Gamon 
et al, 1997; Heidorn 2000), incorporating analysis 
systems for 7 languages (Chinese, English, French, 
German, Japanese, Korean and Spanish). Our 
discussion focuses on a description of the three 
components of the analysis system (called sketch, 
portrait and logical form) with a particular 
emphasis on the logical form derived as the end-
product, which serves as the medium for transfer 
in our MT system.  
 We also give an overview of the architecture 
of the MSR-MT system, and of the evaluation we 
use to measure correctness of the translations. We 
demonstrate the correlation between the scores 
assigned to translation outputs and the correctness 
of the analysis, using as illustration two language-
pairs at different stages of development:  Spanish-
English (SE) translation, as a testbed for the 
Spanish analysis system, and French-English (FE) 
translation, as a testbed for the French analysis 
system.   
2  Overview of the analysis component of 
NLPWin 
Analysis produces three representations for the 
input sentence: sketch, portrait and logical form1.  
Sketch is the initial tree representation for the 
sentence, along with its associated attribute-value 
structure. An example of sketch is given in Figure 
1, which shows the sketch tree for sentence (1).

Figure 1 :  Sketch analysis of (1) 
 
Attachment sites for post-modifiers are not 
determined in sketch.  In most cases, the 
information available as the syntactic tree is built 
is not sufficient to determine where e.g. 
prepositional phrases or relative clauses should be 
attached. Post-modifiers are thus systematically 
attached to the closest possible attachment site, 
and reattached, if necessary, by the reattachment 
module, a set of heuristic rules. 
 Reattachment rules apply to the sketch to 
produce the portrait; the portrait analysis of (1) is 
given in Figure 2, where the PP expressing the 
agent of the passive construction, originally 
attached to PP1 in sketch (see Figure 1) has been 
reattached at the sentence level. 
 
                                                     
1 The presentation of the analysis module is very 
simplified, but sufficient for our current discussion. 
More details can be found in the references.  
 
Figure 2: Portrait analysis of (1) 
 
 The portrait is the input to the computation of 
the logical form (LF), a labeled directed unordered 
graph representing the deep syntactic relations 
among the content words of the sentence (i.e., 
basic predicate-argument structure), along with 
some semantic information, such as functional 
relations expressed by certain prepositions.2 At 
this level, the difference between active and 
passive constructions is normalized; control 
relations and long-distance dependencies, such as 
subjects of infinitives, arguments associated with 
gaps, etc., are resolved.  The LF of (1) is shown in 
Figure 3.  Note that the surface subject of the 
passive is rendered as the Dobj (deep object) in 
LF, and the par-phrase as the Dsub (deep subject). 
 
 
Figure 3 :  LF analysis of (1) 
 
 Modifications to any of the analysis 
components are tested using monolingual 
regression files containing thousands of analyzed 
sentences; differences caused by the modification 
are examined manually by the linguist responsible 
for the change (Suzuki, 2002).  This process serves 
as an initial screening to ensure that modifications 
to the analysis have the desired effect. 
3 MSR-MT 
In this section we review the basics of the MSR-
MT translation system and its evaluation.  The 
reader is referred to Pinkham et al (2001) and 
Richardson et al (2001) for further details on the 
French and Spanish versions of the system. The 
overall architecture and basic component structure

representation of Campbell and Suzuki (2002). 
are the same for both the FE and SE versions of 
the system. 
3.1 Overview 
MSR-MT uses the broad coverage analysis system 
described in Section 2, a large multi-purpose 
source-language dictionary, a learned bilingual 
dictionary, an application independent target-
language generation component and a transfer 
component. 
 The transfer component consists of transfer 
patterns automatically acquired from sentence-
aligned bilingual corpora (described below) using 
an alignment algorithm described in detail in 
Menezes and Richardson (2001). Training takes 
place on aligned sentences which have been 
analyzed by the source- and target-language 
analysis systems to yield logical forms. The 
logical form structures, when aligned, allow the 
extraction of lexical and structural translation 
correspondences which are stored for use at 
runtime in the transfer database. See Figure 4 for 
an overview of the training process. 
 The transfer database is trained on 350,000 
pairs of aligned sentences from computer manuals 
for SE, and 500,000 pairs of aligned Canadian 
parliamentary data (the Hansard corpus) for FE.

3.2   Evaluation of MSR-MT 
Seven evaluators are asked to evaluate the same 
set of sentences. For each sentence, raters are 
presented with a reference sentence, the original 
English sentence from which the human French 
and Spanish translations were derived, and MSR-
MT?s machine translation.3 In order to maintain 
                                                     
3 Microsoft manuals are written in English and 
translated by hand into other languages. We use these 
translations as input to our system, and translate them 
back into English. 
consistency among raters who may have different 
levels of fluency in the source language, raters are 
not shown the original French or Spanish sentence 
(for similar methodologies, see Ringger et al, 
2001; White et al, 1993).  
 All the raters enter scores reflecting the 
absolute quality of the translation as compared to 
the reference translation given. The overall score 
of a sentence is the average of the scores given by 
the seven raters. Scores range from 1 to 4, with 1 
meaning unacceptable (not comprehensible), 2 
meaning possibly acceptable (some information is 
transferred accurately), 3 meaning acceptable (not 
perfect, but accurate transfer of all important 
information, and 4 meaning ideal (grammatically 
correct and all the important information is 
transferred).  
4 Examples from FE and SE 
In this section we discuss specific examples to 
illustrate how results from MT evaluation help us 
to test and develop the analysis system. 
4.1  FE translation: the Hansard corpus 
The evaluation we are discussing in this section 
was performed in January 2002, at the beginning 
of our effort on the Hansard corpus. The 
evaluation was performed on a corpus of 250 
sentences, of which 55.6% (139 sentences) were 
assigned a score of 2 or lower, 30.4% (76 
sentences) were assigned a score greater than 2 but 
not greater than 3, and 14% (35 sentences) were 
assigned a score greater than 3. 
 Examination of French sentences receiving 
low-score translations led to the identification of 
some classes of analysis problems, such as the 
following: 
- mis-identification of vocatives 
- clefts not represented correctly 
- mis-analysis of ce qui / ce que free relatives 
- bad representation of complex inversion 
(pronoun-doubling of inverted subject) 
- no treatment of reflexives 
- fitted parses (i.e., not spanning the sentence) 
Most of the problematic structures are 
characteristic of spoken language as opposed to 
more formal, written styles (vocatives, clefts, 
direct questions), and had not been encountered in 
our previous work, which had involved mostly 
translation of technical manuals. Other problems 
(free relatives, reflexives) are analysis issues that 
we had not yet addressed. Fitted parses are parses 
that do not span the whole sentence, but are pieced 
together by the parser from partial parses; fitted 
parses usually result in poor translations. 
 Examples of translations together with their 
score are given in Table I. The source sentences 
are the French sentences, the reference sentence is 
the human translation to which the translation is 
compared by the evaluators, and the translation is 
the output of MSR-MT. Each of the three 
categories considered above is illustrated by an 
example. 
 Sentence (2) (with a score of 1.5) is a direct 
question with complex inversion and the doubled 
subject typical of that construction. In the LF for 
(2), les ministres des finances is analyzed as a 
modifier, because the verb r?unir already has a 
subject, the pronoun ils ?they?.  There are a couple 
of additional problems with this sentence: si is 
analyzed as the adverb meaning ?so? instead of as 
the conjunction meaning ?if?, and a direct question 
is analyzed as a complement clause; the sketch and 
LF analyses of this sentence are given in the 
Appendix..  The MSR-MT translation of this 
sentence has a very low score, reflecting the 
severity of the analysis problems. 
 The two other sentences, on the other hand, do 
not have analysis problems: the poor translation of 
(3) (score 2.16) is caused by bad alignment (droit 
translates as right instead of law), and the 
translation of (4) (score 3) is not completely fluent, 
but this is due to an English generation problem, 
rather than to a French analysis problem. This last 
sentence is the most correct with appropriate 
lexical items and has the highest score of the three. 
 Of the 139 sentences with score 2 or lower, 
73% were due to analysis problems, and 24% to 
alignment problems. Most of the rest had bugs 
related to the learned dictionary.  There were a few 
cases of very free translations, where the reference 
translation was very far from the French sentence, 
and our translation, based on the source sentence, 
was therefore penalized.  
 These figures show that, at this stage of 
development of our system, most of the problems 
in translation come from analysis. Translation can 
be improved by tackling analysis problems 
exhibited by the lowest scoring sentences, and, 
conversely, analysis issues can be discovered by 
looking at the sentences with the lowest translation 
score.  
 The next section gives examples of issues with 
the SE system, which is more mature than the FE 
system. 
 
4.2  SE translation: Technical manuals 
An evaluation of the Spanish-English MT system 
was also performed in January 2002, after work on 
the MT system had been progressing for 
approximately a year and a half.  The SE system 
was developed and tested using a corpus of 
sentences from Microsoft technical manuals.  A 
set of 600 unseen sentences was used for the 
evaluation.  
 Out of a total of 600 sentences, the number of 
sentences with a score from 3 to 4 was 251 (42%), 
the number of sentences with a score greater than 
2 but less than 3 was 186 (31%), and the 
remaining 163 sentences, (27%) had a score of 2 
or lower. Of these 163 sentences with the lowest 
scores, 50% (82 sentences) had analysis problems, 
and 17% of them (29 sentences) had fitted parses.  
A few of the fitted parses, 7 sentences out of 29, 
had faulty input, e.g. input that contained unusual 
characters or punctuation, typos, or sentence 
fragments.   
 Typical analysis problems that led to poor 
translation in the SE system include the following: 
- incorrect analysis of arguments in relative 
clauses,  especially those with a single 
argument (and a possible non-overt subject) 
- failure to identify the referent of clitic le (i.e. 
usted ?you?) in imperative sentences in LF 
- mis-analysis of Spanish reflexive or 
se constructions in LF 
- incorrect syntactic analysis of homographs 
- incorrect analysis of coordination  
- mis-identification of non-overt or controlled 
subjects  
- fitted parses  
 Table II contains sample sentences from the 
SE evaluation.  For each row, the second column 
displays the Spanish source sentence with the 
reference sentence in the next column, the 
translation produced by the MT system is in the 
fourth column, and the score for the translation 
assigned by the human evaluators in the last 
column.

Table II:  Examples of SE translation 
 
 In the evaluation process, human evaluators 
compared the MT translation to the reference 
sentence, in the manner described in Section 4.1.   
 Example (5), with a score of 3.8, illustrates the 
fact that human evaluators considered the 
translation ?a Windows 2000 language version? to 
be a slightly worse translation than ?a language 
version of Windows 2000? for una version de 
idioma de Windows 2000; however the difference 
is so slight as to not be considered an analysis 
problem. 
 Example (6) illustrates the failure to identify 
usted ?you? (understood as the subject of the 
imperative) as the referent of the pronominal clitic 
le; as mentioned above, this is a common source of 
bad SE translations.  The last example (7) is a 
sentence with a fitted parse due to misanalysis of a 
word as its homograph :  uno is analyzed as the 
first person singular present form of the verb unir 
?join? instead of as the noun uno ?one?; the LF of 
this sentence is given in the Appendix. 
4.3 Discussion 
The examples discussed in this section are typical:  
The sentences for which MSR-MT produces better 
translations tend to be the ones with fewer analysis 
errors, while those which are misanalyzed tend to 
be mistranslated. 
 In this way, evaluation of MT output serves as 
one way to prioritize analysis problems; that is, to 
decide which among the many different analysis 
problems lead to the most serious problems.  For 
example, the poor quality of the translation of (2) 
highlights the need for an improved analysis of 
complex inversion in the French grammar, which 
will need to be incorporated into the sketch and/or 
LF components.  Similarly, the poor translation of 
(7) indicates the need to deal better with 
homographs in the Spanish morphological or 
sketch   component. 
 More generally, the analysis of FE and SE 
translation problems has led to the lists of analysis 
problems given in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, 
respectively.  Analysis problems identified in this 
way then become priorities for grammar/LF 
development. 
5 Conclusion 
We have outlined how the output of MT can be 
used as testbed for linguistic analysis in the source 
language, supplementing other methods.  The 
main advantage of this approach, in our view, is 
that it helps to prioritize analysis problems, 
highlighting those which have the most direct 
bearing on the application(s), the correct 
functioning of which is the main goal of the 
system.
