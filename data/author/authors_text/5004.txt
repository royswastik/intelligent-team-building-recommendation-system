Abstract 
Word extraction is one of the important 
tasks in text information processing. 
There are mainly two kinds of statistic-
based measures for word extraction: the 
internal measure and the contextual 
measure. This paper discusses these two 
kinds of measures for Chinese word 
extraction. First, nine widely adopted 
internal measures are tested and 
compared on individual basis. Then 
various schemes of combining these 
measures are tried so as to improve the 
performance. Finally, the left/right 
entropy is integrated to see the effect of 
contextual measures. Genetic algorithm is 
explored to automatically adjust the 
weights of combination and thresholds. 
Experiments focusing on two-character 
Chinese word extraction show a 
promising result: the F-measure of 
mutual information, the most powerful 
internal measure, is 57.82%, whereas the 
best combination scheme of internal 
measures achieves the F-measure of 
59.87%. With the integration of the 
contextual measure, the word extraction 
achieves the F-measure of 68.48% at last. 
1 Introduction 
New words are generated quite often with the 
rapid development of Chinese society, resulting 
that the lexicon of Chinese cannot well meet the 
requirement of natural language processing. How 
to extract word automatically from immense text 
collection has thus become an important problem. 
The task of extracting Chinese words with 
multi-characters from texts is quite similar to that 
of extracting phrases (e.g., compound nouns) in 
English, if we regard Chinese characters as English 
words. Research in word/phrase extraction has 
been carried out extensively. Currently the 
mainstream approach is statistic-based. In general, 
there are two kinds of statistic-based measures for 
estimating the soundness of an extracted item 
being a word/phrase: One is the internal measure, 
which estimates the soundness by the internal 
associative strength between constituents of the 
item. Nine widely adopted internal measures are 
listed in (Schone et al 2001), including Frequency, 
Mutual Information, Selectional Association, 
Symmetric Conditional Probability, Dice Formula, 
Log-likelihood, Chi-squared, Z-score, Student?s t-
score. The other kind is the contextual measure, 
which estimates the soundness by the dependency 
of the item on its context, such as the left/right 
entropy (Sornlertlamvanich et al 2000), and the 
left/right context dependency (Chien 1999). 
This paper firstly analyzes nine internal 
measures mentioned above, tests and compares 
their word extraction performance on individual 
basis, then tries to improve the performance by 
properly combining these measures. Furthermore, 
the contextual measure is integrated with internal 
measures to acquire more improvement. 
Throughout the experiments, genetic algorithm is 
explored to adjust weights of combination and 
thresholds automatically. We only concern two-
character word extraction in this paper, because 
two-character words reflect the most popular 
word-formation of Chinese and possess the largest 
proportion in Chinese lexicon.

2.1 
Internal Measures 
Nine internal measures are discussed and 
compared in this section. These measures tend to 
estimate the internal associative strength from 
different perspectives, so it is possible to improve 
the word extraction performance by properly 
combining them. This paper will try two 
combination schemes, i.e., direct combination and 
interval-based combination. 
As stated earlier, the evaluation is based on two-
character Chinese word extraction. PDR9596, a 
raw corpus of People Daily of 1995 and 1996 with 
about 50.0M characters, is used to train the matrix 
of Chinese character bigrams throughout the 
experiments. PDA98J, a manually word-
segmented corpus composed of People Daily of 
January 1998 with about 1.3M characters 
(developed by Institute of Computational 
Linguistics of Peking University), is further used 
to exhaustively generate a list of Chinese character 
bigrams. The list contains 218,863 distinct bigrams. 
We randomly divide the list into two parts, 9/10 of 
it as TS1, the rest 1/10 as TS2.  
Nine Widely Adopted Internal Measures 
Table 1 lists nine widely adopted internal 
measures, as mentioned in (Schone 2000). In the 
table: xy  represents any two-character item, x  
stands for all characters except x, is the size of 
training corpus,  and are frequency and 
probability of x respectively, and  are 
frequency and probability of 
N

xy  respectively, and 
xy?  is the frequency expectation of xy  suppose  x 
and y are independent.

When using these nine measures for word 
extraction, the hypothesis is same: the larger value 
of measure means the stronger associative 
strength between x and y, and thus the more 
possibility of xy  being a word. The criterion of 
judgment is very simple: xy  would be accepted 
as a word if its internal associative strength is 
larger than a given threshold.  
2.2 
2.3 
Word Extraction Performance of Each 
Internal Measure 
The performance of each internal measure is 
tested on TS1. TS1 contains 196,977 distinct 
bigrams, among which 17,333 are two-character 
words according to PDA98J. The procedure of 
word extraction is to sort the 196,977 candidate 
bigrams in descending order in terms of the value 
of  the measure to be tested, and then to select the 
top 17,333 bigrams as words. In this case, the 
precision rate, recall rate and F-measure are 
exactly the same. Table 2 shows the comparison 
of performances of these nine internal measures. 
Mutual information achieves the best performance 
with the F-measure of 54.77%.  
Direct Combination of Internal Measures 
The first combination scheme is to directly 
combine the nine measures with appropriate 
weights. The internal associative strength of an 
item xy  is estimated by: 
?
=
?=
9
1
))(()(
i
ii xyscorewtxyscore  
where  is the value of )(xyscorei xy
9
1
?
=
wt
 given by the 
i-th measure, and is the weight for the i-th 
measure accordingly (satisfying ). 
iwt
1=
i
i
The determination of weights is not 
straightforward due to the presence of 
combinatorial explosion (notice that  is real 
number). Genetic algorithm (Pan 1998) is 
explored to adjust the weights automatically, 
trying to find the optimal one. Let (wt
iwt
1, wt2,?,wt9) 
be a possible solution, we set the F-measure of 
word extraction on TS1 to be the fitness function, 
and set the size of population to be 25. We simply 
use the GenocopIII software (Michalewicz) to do 
the job.  
In a PIII650 PC, GenocopIII runs 12 hours, 
iterates 1,161 generation, and converges to a 
group of weights (as shown in Table 3). With this 
group of weights, the F-measure of word 
extraction on TS1 is 55.44%, improving only 
0.67% over the most powerful single measure MI 
(54.77%). Note this is not a pure open test, 
because the fitness function of genetic algorithm 
is based on TS1. 
2.4 Interval-based Combination of Internal 
Measures 
The experimental result in section 2.3 shows 
that it is not so effective to combine the nine 
measures directly. We try another combination 
scheme now, i.e., interval-based combination.  
2.4.1 The Idea 
The idea is as follows: for every measure 
mentioned above, we first discretize its value 
range into a number of intervals. Every interval of 
every measure is then assigned a corresponding 
probability that indicates the tendency of any item 
being regarded as a word if its value with respect 
to this measure falls into this interval. We name 
this kind of probability ?the interval probability?.  
The soundness of an item being a word would be 
the weighted sum of all of its interval probabilities 
over nine measures. 
We describe the idea in a more formal way. 
Suppose is the internal associative 
strength of any item 
)(xyscorei
xy  with respect to the i-th 
measure,  is its corresponding interval 
determined by the value of score ,  
is the interval probability of v , then the 
soundness of 
)(xyvi
)(xyi
)(xyi
)(xypvi
xy  being word, , will be 
given by:  
)(xypv
?
=
?=
9
1
))(()(
i
ii xypvwtxypv  
where is the weight for the i-th measure.  iwt
If  is larger than a threshold, )(xypv xy  
would be extracted out as a word.  
2.4.2 The Related Issues 
Three related issues need to be clarified. 
(1) How to discretize the range of a measure 
with continuous values?  
We use D-2, an entropy-based top-down 
algorithm (Catlett 1991) to discretize the value 
range by supervised learning. It adopts the 
information gain as the criterion to decide whether 
a given training set should be further partitioned 
or not. Given a set of examples S, the information 
gain caused by a cut point t  will be: 
)(
||
||
)(
||
||
)(),( 2
2
1
1 SEnt
S
S
SEnt
S
S
SEntStIG ??=
1 S
 
where Ent(S) is the entropy of S, and S  and  
are two subsets of S partitioned by the cut point t . 
2
It has been proved that the information gain 
obtains optimal discretization only on boundary 
points (Fayyad et al 1992, Elomaa et al 2000). So 
only boundary points need to be examined as 
potential cut points. Suppose T is the set of 
boundary points, the D-2 algorithm for 
discretizing set S  is: 
ALGORITHM DISCRETE (S,T)    
BEGIN 
Step1. For each  in T, calculate  t ),( StIG
Step2. Select ,  is  )),((maxarg0 StIGt
t
= S
partitioned into two subsets: ,  1S 2S
Step3. If stopping criteria are satisfied, 
Step4.    then DO NOT partition , Return S ? .   
//?  is an empty set 
Step5.    else     P1 = DISCRETE( , T1S 1) 
                         P2 = DISCRETE( ,T2S 2) 
      P = P1 + { } + P2, Return P.   0t
//P is the set of cut points for 
discretizing S 
END 
This algorithm only considers two stopping 
criteria. One is the minimal number of samples in 
an interval, the other is the minimum information 
gain. With this algorithm, we finally get a set of 
cut points each measure, which discretize the 
value range to variable-length intervals. 
(2) How to assign the interval probability to 
each interval? 
After discretization, training examples (i.e., a 
list of Chinese character bigrams) will be 
distributed to a certain interval according to its 
value of a given measure. Let  represent the j-th 
interval of the i-th measure, then pv , the 
interval probability of v , is defined as: 
ijv
)( ijv
ij
inwordsbeingbigrams
ij
ij
ij vinbigramsof
vof
vpv
#
#
)( =

   (3) How to set the weights for combining all 
in the process of word extraction?  pv
Genetic algorithm is again invoked to adjust the 
weight . The configuration of GenecopIII is 
the same as that in session 2.3. 
iwt
2.4.3 Effect of the Stopping Criteria and 
Discretization Strategy on Combination 
The stopping criteria and discretization strategy 
take effect on the word extraction performance of 
interval-based combination. 
First, have a look at the effect of stopping 
criteria. In DISCRETE, two stopping criteria are 
needed to set. We fix the minimal number of 
samples in one interval on 50 arbitrarily. And, we 
change the setting of the minimum information 
gain. In Table 4, performances under five different 
minimum information gains are compared, 
marked as D1, D2 ,?, D5 respectively. It can be 
seen that, the smaller the minimal information 
gain, the finer the granularity of discretization, 
and the better the performance of word extraction. 
But if the discretization is too grainy, it may cause 
over-fitting problem. Compared with D4 and D5, 
D3 achieves nearly the same performance but has 
a much rough discretization. So, we set the 
minimum information gain to be 0.0001 (D3) in 
the following experiments. 
Second, observe the effect of the discretization 
strategy. The equal-length discretization is 
compared to the variable-length discretization. We 
divide the value range of each measure into equal-
length intervals, and let the number of intervals be 
identical to that in D3 accordingly. As shown in 
Table 4, the equal-length discretization only 
achieves the F-measure of 55.56%, which is much 
less than D3 (57.45%). This means the entropy-
based discretization is more reasonable than 
equal-length discretization, and the discretization 
strategy has significant impact on the performance 
of interval-based combination. 
2.4.4 Reduction of Measures for Combination 
To improve the performance of word extraction 
through combination, the premise is that there 
must be enough mutual supplements among those 
measures. However, if the combination involves 
too many measures, interference may become 
obvious. We try to reduce the number of measures 
for combination. 
The reduction procedure is recursive: It first 
compares the performance after removing any of 
the n measures, then reduces the one that can 
bring the most improvement of performance if it 
is removed. Repeat this reduction procedure in the 
left n-1 measures, until the performance cannot 
improve anymore. 
Table 5 shows the reduction procedure of the 
nine internal measures. It indicates that, excluding 
SA and SCP, the interval-based combination of 
other seven measures could achieve the best F-
measure of 57.77%, with the weights in Table 6. 
That result is 3.00% higher than that of the most 
powerful internal measure MI (54.77%).  
Note again that all tests in section 2.4 are not 
pure open, because all the related parameters such 
as granularity of discretization, reduction of 
measures and adjustment of combination weights, 
are based on TS1.

3 The Contextual Measure 
This section turns to discuss how to make use 
of contextual measures. The most commonly used 
contextual measure is the left/right entropy: 
?
??
??=
Aa
xyaxypxyaxypxyLe )|(log)|()( 2  
?
??
??=
Ab
xyxybpxyxybpxy )|(log)|()Re( 2  
where: xy  is the candidate item, a, b are Chinese 
characters belonging to A, the set of Chinese 
characters. 
In the sight of entropy, the larger the value of 
Le(xy) and Re(xy), the more various the characters 
coming after/before xy, and thus the more possible 
xy to be a word. 
4 The Hybrid  of Internal and Contextual 
Measures 
Combining the contextual measure with internal 
measures, the word extraction process would 
become like this: First, any candidate item xy  not 
satisfying the contextual condition is rejected. The 
contextual condition is, Le(xy)>t1 and Re(xy)>t2. 
Second, those residual candidates will be 
extracted out as words if their internal measure or 
combination of internal measures is high than a 
given threshold t3. In this paper, we try two 
alternatives of hybrid for comparison: one is the 
contextual measure with mutual information, the 
best single internal measure; another one is the 
contextual measure with Comb, the best result of 
interval-based combination of seven internal 
measures (Freq, MI, Dice, LogL, Chi, ZS, TS).  
We need to determine three thresholds in above 
process, Threshold t3 are set as the value to select 
the top 17,333 candidates from TS1: according to  
experiments in section 2, MI will choose t3=4.0, 
while Comb will choose t3=0.26. To set 
appropriate thresholds t1 and t2, we still employ 
genetic algorithm. We let a group of threshold (t1, 
t2) be a possible solution, and let the F-measure of 
word extraction on TS1 be fitness. Two groups of 
thresholds can be thus obtained: 
(1) MI-tuned thresholds: t1=2.2, t2=1.4. 
(2) Comb-tuned thresholds: t1=1.8, t2=1.2. 
To further investigate the effect of internal 
measures, the contextual measure and the hybrid, 
we conduct a series of open tests on TS2, as 
demonstrated in Table 7. Since the left/right 
entropy would become less reliable in cases that 
the occurrences of contexts are not sufficient, we 
drop out those candidates whose frequencies are 
no more than 5 in TS2. After dropping, TS2 
contains 14,867 candidates, out of which 1,589 
are words according to PDA98J. 
      In the first two rows of Table 7, the best single 
internal measure, MI, and our best combination of 
internal measures Comb are open tested. The 
successive three rows show the effect of 
contextual measures. The row of ?MI+Le/Re? 
selects MI as the internal measure, and use the 
MI-tuned thresholds as t1 and t2. The rows of 
?Comb+Le/Re*? and ?Comb+Le/Re? both select 
Comb as the internal measure, but use different t1 
and t2: The former uses MI-tuned thresholds, 
while the latter uses Comb-tuned thresholds. 
From Table 7, we can draw several conclusions: 
(1) With open test, the F-measure of MI, the best 
single internal measure, is 57.82%, whereas the F-
measure of our interval-based combination is 
59.87%; (2) The integration of the commonly 
used contextual measure, the left/right entropy 
with internal measures, can bring a large 
improvement of about 8%~9%; (3) There is only a 
modest difference between the performances of 
?Comb+Le/Re*? and ?Comb+Le/Re?, and two 
group of thresholds adjusted by different internal 
measures  have small difference as well. 
5 Conclusion 
    This paper focuses on the research of pure 
statistic-based measures for automatic extraction 
of two-character Chinese words. Two kinds of 
statistic-based measures are discussed: internal 
measures and contextual measures. Nine internal 
measures are tested and compared. Two schemes 
are tried to improve the performance by properly 
combining these nine measures. Experimental 
results in open tests show that, the best 
combination scheme, interval-based combination, 
achieves the F-measure of 59.87%, improving 
2.05% over the best single internal measure 
mutual information. On the other hand, the 
left/right entropy, a kind of contextual measure, is 
integrated to acquire further improvement in word 
extraction. With the left/right entropy and 
interval-based combination of internal measures, 
the F-measure ultimately achieves 68.48%. 
Another point of this paper is that, weights for 
combination and thresholds for left/right entropy 
are adjusted automatically by genetic algorithm, 
rather than manually. 
Future work will extend the proposed method 
to automatic extraction of multi-character Chinese 
words. Other useful information, such as lexicon 
and semantic resource, are expected to be 
included for consideration so as to further improve 
the performance.
