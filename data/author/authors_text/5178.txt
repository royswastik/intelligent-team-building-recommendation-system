ABSTRACT
As part of MITRE?s work under the DARPA TIDES
(Translingual Information Detection, Extraction and
Summarization) program, we are preparing a series of
demonstrations to showcase the TIDES Integrated Feasibility
Experiment on Bio-Security (IFE-Bio).  The current
demonstration illustrates some of the resources that can be made
available to analysts tasked with monitoring infectious disease
outbreaks and other biological threats.
Keywords
Translation, information extraction, summarization, topic
detection and tracking, system integration.
1. INTRODUCTION
The long-term goal of TIDES is to provide delivery of
information on demand in real-time from live on-line sources. For
IFE-Bio, the resources made available to the analyst include e-
mail, news groups, digital library resources, and eventually (in
later versions), topic-specific segments from broadcast news.
Because of the emphasis on global monitoring, there is a need to
process incoming information in multiple languages.  The system
must deliver the appropriate information content in the
appropriate form and in the appropriate language (taken for now
to be English). This means that the IFE-Bio system will have to
deliver news stories, clusters of relevant documents, threaded
discussions, alerts on new events, tables, summaries (particularly
over document collections), answers to questions, graphs and geo-
spatial  temporal displays of information.
The demonstration system for the Human Language Technology
Conference in March 2001 represents an early stage of the full
IFE-Bio system, with an emphasis on end-to-end processing.
Future demonstrations will make use of MITRE?s Catalyst
architecture, providing an efficient, scalable architecture to
facilitate  integration of multiple stages of linguistic processing.
By June 2001, the IFE-Bio system will provide richer linguistic
processing through the integration of modules contributed by
other TIDES participants. By June 2002, the IFE-Bio system will
include additional functionality, such as real-time broadcast news
feeds, new machine translation components, support for question-
answering, cross-language information retrieval, multi-document
summarization, automatic extraction and normalization of
temporal and spatial information, and automated geospatial and
temporal displays.
2. The IFE-Bio System
The current demonstration (March 2001) highlights the basic
functionality required by an analyst, including:
? Capture of sources, including e-mail, digital library
material, news groups, and web-based resources;
? Categorizing of the sources into multiple orthogonal
hierarchies useful to the analyst, e.g., disease, region, news
source, language;
? Processing of the information through various stages,
including ?zoning? of the text to select the relevant portions
for processing; named entity detection, event detection,
extraction of temporal information, summarization, and
translation from Spanish, Portuguese, and Chinese into
English;
? Access to the information through use of any mail and news
group reader, which allows the analyst to organize, save, and
share the information in a familiar, readily accessible
environment;
? Display of the information in alternate forms, including
color-tagged documents, tables, summaries, graphs, and
geospatial, map-based displays.
Figure 1 below shows the overall functionality envisioned
for the IFE-Bio system, including capture, categorizing,
processing, access and display.
Collection capability for the current IFE-Bio system includes
email, news groups, journals, and Web resources. We have a
complete copy of the ProMED mailings (a moderated source
tracking global infectious disease outbreaks), and are routinely
collecting other information sources from the World Health
Organization and CDC.  In addition, we are collecting several
general global news feeds. Current volume is around 2000
messages per day; we estimate capacity for the current system at
around 4500 messages/day. Once we have integrated a filtering
capability, we expect the volume of messages saved in IFE-Bio
should drop significantly, since many of the global news services
report on a wide range of events and not all need to be passed on
to IFE-Bio analysts.  The categorizing of sources is done based on
the message header. The header is synthesized by extracting key
information about disease name, the country, and other relevant
information such as type of victim and source of information, as
well as date of message receipt.
The processing for the current demonstration system uses a
limited subset of the Catalyst architecture capabilities and a
number of in-house linguistic modules. The linguistic modules in
the current demonstration system include tokenization, sentence
segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, named entity detection,
temporal extraction (Mani and Wilson 2000) and source-specific
event detection.  In addition, we have incorporated the
CyberTrans embedded machine translation system which ?wraps?
available machine translation engines to make them available via
an e-mail or Web interface (Reeder 2000). Single document
summarization is performed by the MITRE WebSumm system
(Mani and Bloedorn 1999).
We carefully chose a light-weight interface mechanism for
delivery of the information to the analyst.  By treating the
incoming streams of data as feeds to a news server, the analyst can
inspect and organize the information using a familiar news and e-
mail browser. The analyst can subscribe to areas of interest, flag
important messages, watch specific threads, and create tailored
filters for monitoring outbreaks. The stories are crossed-posted to
multiple relevant news groups, based on the information in the
header, e.g., a story on Ebola in Africa would be cross posted to
the Africa regional newsgroup and to the Ebola disease
newsgroup. Search by subject and date allow the analyst to select
subsets of the messages for further processing, annotation or
sharing.  The news client provides notification of incoming
messages. In later versions, we plan to integrate topic detection
and tracking capabilities, to provide improved filtering and
routing of messages, as well as detection of new topics.  The use
of this simple delivery mechanism provides a familiar
environment with almost no learning curve, and it avoids issues of
platform and operating system dependence.
Finally, the system makes use of several different devices to
display the information appropriately. Figure 2 shows the layout
of the Netscape news browser interface.  It includes the list of
newsgroups that have been subscribed to (on the left), the list of
messages from the chosen newsgroup (on top), and a particular
message with color-coded named entities (including disease terms
displayed in red, so that they are easy to spot in the message).
What is the status of the
current Ebola outbreak?
The epidemic is contained;
as of 12/22/00, there were

Figure 3: Sample Summarization Automatically Generated by WebSumm
There are multiple display modalities available. The message in
Figure 2 contains a short tabular display in the beginning,
identifying disease, region and victim type. Below that is a URL
to a document summary, created by MITRE?s WebSumm system
(see Figure 3 for a sample summary).   If an incoming message is
in a language other than English, then CyberTrans is called to run
code set and language identification modules, and the language is
translated into English for further processing. Figure 4 below
shows a sample translated message; note that there are a number
of untranslated words, but it is still possible to get the gist of the
message.
In addition, we are working on a mechanism to provide
geographic and eventually, temporal display of outbreak
information. Figure 5 shows the stages of processing involved.
Stage 1 shows onamed entity and temporal tagging to identify the
items of interest. These are combined into disease events by
further linguistic processing; the result is shown in the table in
Stage 2. This spreadsheet of events serves as input for a map-
based display, shown in Stage 3. The graph plots number of new
cases and number of cumulative cases over time.  In the map, the
size of the outer dot represents total number of cases to date, and
the inner dot represents new cases.  This allows the analyst to
visualize spread of the disease, as well as the stage of the outbreak
(spreading or subsiding).
