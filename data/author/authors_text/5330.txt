Abstract 
FarsiSum is an attempt to create an automatic 
text summarization system for Persian. The 
system is implemented as a HTTP 
client/server application written in Perl. It uses 
modules implemented in an existing 
summarizer geared towards the Germanic 
languages, a Persian stop-list in Unicode 
format and a small set of heuristic rules. 
1 Introduction 
FarsiSum is an attempt to create an automatic 
text summarization system for Persian (Mazdak, 
2004). The system is implemented as a HTTP 
client/server application written in Perl. It uses 
modules implemented in SweSum (Dalianis 2000), 
a Persian stop-list in Unicode format and a small 
set of heuristic rules. The stop-list is a file 
including the most common verbs, pronouns, 
adverbs, conjunctions, prepositions and articles in 
Persian. The words not included in the stop-list are 
supposed to be nouns or adjectives. The idea is that 
nouns and adjectives are meaning-carrying words 
and should be regarded as keywords. 
The current implementation of FarsiSum is still a 
prototype. It uses a very simple stop-list in order to 
filter and identify the important keywords in the 
text. Persian acronyms and abbreviations are not 
detected by the current tokenizer.  
In addition, Persian syntax is quite ambiguous in 
its written form (Megerdoomian and R?mi 2000), 
which raises certain difficulties in automatic 
parsing of written text and automatic text 
summarization for Persian. 
For example, selection of important keywords 
in the topic identification process will be affected 
by the following word boundary ambiguities: 
? Compound words may appear as two different 
words. 
? Bound morphemes may appear as free 
morphemes or vice versa. 
  
These ambiguities are not resolved in the current 
implementation. 
2 SweSum 
SweSum1 (Dalianis 2000) is a web-based 
automatic text summarizer developed at the Royal 
Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden. It uses 
text extraction based on statistical and linguistic as 
well as heuristic methods to obtain text 
summarization and its main domain is Swedish 
HTML-tagged newspaper text2. 
2.1 SweSum?s architecture 
SweSum is a client/server application. The 
summarizer is located on the web server. It takes a 
Swedish text as input and performs summarization 
in three phases to create the final output (the 
summarized text).

Pass 1: The sentence and word boundaries are 
identified by searching for periods, exclamation 
and question marks etc (with the exception of 
when periods occur in known abbreviations). The 
sentences are then scored by using statistical, 
linguistic and heuristic methods. The scoring 
depends on, for example, the position of the 
sentence in the text, numerical values in and

Norwegian, Spanish, French, German, and now with the 
implementation described in this paper, Farsi. 
various formatting of the sentence such as bold, 
headings, etc. 
 
Pass 2: In the second pass, the score of each 
word in the sentence is calculated and added to the 
sentence score. Sentences containing common 
content words get higher scores. 
 
Pass 3: In the third pass, the final summary file 
(HTML format) is created. This file includes: 
? The highest ranking sentences up to a pre-
set threshold. 
? Optionally, statistical information about 
the summary, i.e. the number of words, 
number of lines, the most frequent 
keywords, actual compression rate etc.  
 
For most languages SweSum uses a static 
lexicon containing many high frequent open class 
words. The lexicon is a data structure for storing 
key/value pairs where the key is the inflected word 
and the value is the stem/root of the word. For 
example boy and boys have different inflections 
but the same root (lemma). 
3 FarsiSum 
FarsiSum is a web-based text summarizer for 
Persian based upon SweSum. It summarizes 
Persian newspaper text/HTML in Unicode format. 
FarsiSum uses the same structure used by SweSum 
(see Figure 2), with exception of the lexicons, but 
some modifications have been made in SweSum in 
order to support Persian texts in Unicode format. 
3.1 User Interface 
The user interface includes: 
? The first page of FarsiSum on WWW 
presented in Persian3. 
? A Persian online editor for writing in 
Persian. 
The final summary including statistical 
information to the user, presented in Persian. 
3.2 Stop List 
The current implementation uses a simple stop 
list rather than a full-fledged Persian lexicon. The 
stop-list is a HTML file (UTF-8 encoding) 
containing about 200 high-frequency Persian 
words including the most common verbs, 
pronouns, adverbs, conjunctions, prepositions and 
articles.

farsi.html
 
The stop-list has been successively built 
during the implementation phase by iteratively 
running FarsiSum in order to find the most 
common words in Persian.   
The assumption is that words not included in the 
stop-list are nouns or adjectives (content words) 
and should be counted as such in the word 
frequency list. 
3.3 Tokenizer 
The tokenizer is modified in order to recognize 
Persian comma, semi colon and question mark. 
? Sentence boundaries are found by 
searching for periods, exclamation and 
question marks as well as <BR> (the 
HTML new line) and the Persian question 
mark (?). 
? The tokenizer finds the word boundaries 
by searching for characters such as ?.?, ?,?, 
?!?, ???, ?<?, ?>?, ?:?, spaces, tabs and 
new lines. Persian semi colon, comma and 
question mark can also be recognized. 
? All words in the document are converted 
from ASCII to UTF-8. These words are 
then compared with the words in the stop-
list. Words not included in the stop list are 
regarded as content words and will be 
counted as keywords.  
The word order in Persian is SOV4, i.e. the last 
word in a sentence is a verb. This knowledge is 
used to prevent verbs from being stored in the 
Word frequency table. 
3.4 Architecture 
FarsiSum is implemented as a HTTP 
client/server application as shown in Figure 2. The 
summarization program is located on the server 
side and the client is a browser such as Internet 
Explorer or Netscape Navigator.

The summarization process starts when the user 
(client) clicks on a hyperlink (summarize) on the 
FarsiSum Web site: 
? The browser (Web client) sends a 
summarization request (marked 1 in 
Figure 2) to the Web server where 
FarsiSum is located. The document/ (URL 
of the document) to be summarized is 
attached to the request. (The original text 
is in Unicode format). 
? The document is summarized in three 
phases including tokenizing, scoring and 
keyword extraction. Words in the 
document are converted from ASCII to 
UTF-8. These words are then compared 
with the words in the stop-list (2-5).   
? The summary is returned back to the 
HTTP server that returns the summarized 
document to the client (6).  
The browser then renders the summarized text to 
the screen. 
4 Conclusions 
The system would most certainly benefit from 
deeper language specific analysis, but with no 
access to Persian resources, in this system fairly 
language independent methods have proven to 
come a long way.
