Abstract
Individuals using an Augmentative and
Alternative Communication (AAC) de-
vice communicate at less than 10% of
the speed of ?traditional? speech, creat-
ing a large communication gap. In this
user study, we compare the communica-
tion rate of pseudo-impaired individuals
using two different word prediction algo-
rithms and a system without word pre-
diction. Our results show that word pre-
diction can increase AAC communication
rate and that more accurate predictions
significantly improve communication rate.
1 Introduction
Communication is a significant quality-of-life issue
for individuals with severe speech impairments. The
field of Augmentative and Alternative Communica-
tion (AAC) is concerned with mitigating commu-
nication barriers that would otherwise isolate indi-
viduals from society. Most high-tech AAC devices
provide the user with an electronic letter and word
board to input messages which are output via speech
synthesis. However, even with substantial user inter-
face optimization, communication rate is often less
than 10 words per minute (Newell et al, 1998) as
compared to about 150-200 words per minute for
unimpaired speech.
One way to improve communication rate is to de-
crease the number of keys entered to form a mes-
sage. Word prediction is an application of language
modeling to allowing the user to access words they
may be spelling at a cost of one keystroke. Many
commercial AAC devices use word prediction, such
as PRC?s PathfinderTM, Dynavox Technology?s Dy-
navox 4TM, and Saltillo?s ChatPCTM.
Although word prediction is used in AAC de-
vices, researchers have questioned whether it ac-
tually increases communication rate (Venkatagiri,
1993; Koester and Levine, 1997; Anson et al,
2004). These works note the additional cognitive
demands and cost of using word prediction in con-
junction with a letter-by-letter interface, such as the
need to shift the focus of attention to the prediction
list, the time to scan the prediction list, and the cog-
nitive effort required for making decisions about the
predicted words. Obviously the design of the par-
ticular interface (e.g., the ease of using word pre-
diction) will affect these results. In addition, these
studies used a single, simplistic method of generat-
ing predictions, and this may also be responsible for
some of their results.
In contrast, other researchers (Lesher and Hig-
ginbotham, 2005; Li and Hirst, 2005; Trnka et
al., 2006) have continued to investigate various im-
provements to language modeling for word pre-
diction in order to save the user more keystrokes.
Newer methods such as topic modeling yield sta-
tistically significant keystroke savings over previ-
ous methods. However, the question remains as to
whether improvements in prediction methods trans-
late to an enhanced communication rate. We hypoth-
esize that it will.
In this paper we study (1) whether a word pre-
diction interface increases communication rate over
173
letter-by-letter typing when a reasonable prediction
method is employed and (2) whether an advanced
word prediction method increases communication
rate over a basic word prediction method to a degree
greater than that afforded by the difference in theo-
retical keystroke savings between the two methods.
We expect that the communication rate gain due to
the better word prediction method will exceed the
gains from the poorer system. Our reasons for this
expectation has to do with not only users wasting
time scanning lists that do not contain the desired
word, but also the tendency for a user to give up on
such a system (i.e., choosing to ignore the predic-
tions) and thus missing the predicted word even if it
does appear in the list. Validating these hypotheses
will motivate continued improvements in word pre-
diction methods for increased communication rate.
The target population of our research is adult
AAC users without significant cognitive impair-
ments. Including actual AAC users in the study
poses several significant complications, perhaps the
largest of which concerns the user interface. AAC
devices vary significantly in the physical interfaces
available, in accordance with the variety of physi-
cal abilities of AAC users. This diversity has caused
different word prediction interfaces to be developed
for each physical interface. Moreover, it would be
impossible to mimic our word prediction layout in a
consistent fashion on all of the major AAC devices
used. Because of this, we conducted this pilot study
using subjects that are pseudo-impaired: the subjects
have no motor impairments but we have simulated
a motor impairment by providing an interface that
emulates the communication rate of a typical AAC
user. Future work includes the verification of the re-
sults using a smaller number of actual AAC users.
2 Approach
The purpose of the study was to measure the effects
of word prediction methods on communication rate.
To this end, the interface used for text entry was opti-
mized for ease-of-use and kept constant across trials.
Subjects were asked to enter text on a touchscreen
monitor using WivikTM, an on-screen keyboard. Be-
cause we wanted to simulate AAC users with mo-
tor impairments, we programmed a 1.5 second de-
lay between a key press and its registration in the
system. The artificial impairment gave the subjects
the same incentive to use word prediction that AAC
users face every day, whereas users with fine motor
control tend to ignore word prediction (e.g., in com-
mon word processing software). The delay slows the
input rate of our subjects down to a rate more typical
of AAC users (about 8-10 words per minute).
Seventeen adult, native speakers of English with
no visual, cognitive, or motor impairments partic-
ipated in the study. These subjects were asked to
type in three different excerpts from held-out data of
the Switchboard corpus on three different days.1 In
each of these sessions, a different prediction method
was used and the order of prediction methods was
randomized across subjects. Keystrokes and pre-
dictions were logged and then post-processed to
compute the words produced per minute, seconds
per keystroke, and keystroke savings, among other
statistics.
2.1 Independent variable: prediction methods
The independent variable in our study is the method
of text entry used: (1) letter-by-letter typing using
the Wivik keyboard with no word prediction, (2)
letter-by-letter typing augmented with word predic-
tions produced by a basic prediction method, (3)
letter-by-letter typing augmented with word predic-
tions produced by an advanced prediction method.
Basic prediction generates predictions from the
combination of a recency model of the text entered
so far in conjunction with a large word list. The
recency model is given priority in generating pre-
dictions. This model is similar to language models
used in AAC devices with the exception that many
devices use a unigram model in lieu of a word list.
Advanced prediction generates predictions on
the basis of a trigram model with backoff. A spe-
cial unigram model is used for the first word in
each sentence. This language model is constructed
from the transcribed telephone conversations of the
Switchboard corpus. If the prediction list isn?t filled
from this model?s predictions, then predictions are
selected from a recency model and then a word list,
as in the basic prediction method.
1Switchboard was chosen because our prediction models
were trained using another portion of the corpus. A copy task
was chosen for more controlled experimental conditions.

3 Results
Once the data was collected, we post-processed the
logs and accumulated statistics. Average values for
each method are shown in Figure 1 and comparative
values are shown in Figure 2.
3.1 Communication rate (output rate)
The overall average words per minute and task com-
pletion time for each method is shown in Figure 1,
and Figure 2 shows comparative data for the three
methods. As hypothesized, advanced prediction was
found to be significantly faster than basic prediction
and basic prediction was found to be significantly
faster than no prediction (? = 0.01). For example,
users produced 59.9% more words per minute using
advanced prediction compared to no prediction. Ad-
vanced prediction was 44.4% faster than basic pre-
diction but basic prediction was only 10.1% faster
than no prediction.
Additionally, the relative task completion time is
shown in Figure 2. The copy tasks with advanced
prediction were completed in 64.5% of the time it
took to complete without word prediction. The trend
shown with relative task completion time reinforces
the trends shown with words per minute ? advanced
prediction offers a large speedup over no prediction
and basic prediction, but basic prediction offers a
much smaller increase over no prediction.
Our results show that basic word prediction sig-
nificantly boosts communication rate and that ad-
vanced word prediction substantially increases com-
munication rate beyond basic prediction.
3.2 Input rate (seconds per keystroke)
Figures 1 and 2 indicate that there were significant
differences (at ? = 0.01) in the methods in terms
of the rate at which keys were pressed. In partic-
ular, while overall communication rate was signif-
icantly faster with advanced prediction, users took
0.641 seconds longer for each key press from us-
ing advanced prediction compared to entry without
prediction. Similarly, users spent 0.345s longer to
enter each key using advanced as opposed to basic
prediction and basic prediction required more time
per keystroke than no prediction. The slower input
rate can be attributed to the additional demands of
searching through a prediction list and making a de-
cision about selecting a word from that list over con-
tinuing to type letters.
3.3 Keystroke savings / prediction utilization
The difference between the potential keystroke sav-
ings offered by advanced and basic prediction is sub-
stantial: 55.2% vs. 25.0%, as shown in Figure 1.
Accordingly, the actual keystroke savings that users
realized under each prediction method shows a wide
separation: 50.3% for advanced and 18.2% for ba-
sic. The keystroke savings that users of basic predic-
tion achieved seems quite a bit lower than the poten-
tial keystroke savings offered by the predictions. In
other words, the prediction utilization of basic pre-
diction was much lower than that of advanced pre-
diction. Comparative analysis shows a 17.1% im-
provement in prediction utilization from advanced
over basic prediction.
4 Discussion
The results show that communication rate increased
despite the decreased input rate due to a large reduc-
tion in the amount of input required (high keystroke
savings). In the past, researchers have noted that the
cognitive load of using word prediction was consid-
erable, so that the keystroke savings of word pre-

diction was outweighed by the overhead of using
it. However, we have shown that despite significant
cognitive load, the reduction in keystroke savings
dominates the effect on output rate.
In contrast to earlier studies, our basic method
showed a significantly improved communication
rate over no prediction. One reason for this could
be the intuitiveness of our user interface. A second
reason could be related to the consistency of the ba-
sic prediction method. In particular, at least some
subjects using the basic prediction method learned
to scan the prediction list when the desired word was
recently used and mentioned it in the exit survey. At
other times they simply ignored the prediction list
and proceeded with letter-by-letter typing. This be-
havior would also explain why the input was sig-
nificantly slower with the advanced method over the
basic method ? users found that scanning the predic-
tion list more often was worth the added effort. This
also explains the significant difference in prediction
utilization between the methods.
The relationship between keystroke savings and
communication rate is a trend of increasing rate
enhancement with increasingly accurate prediction
methods. Improved prediction methods offer greater
potential keystroke savings to users and users see
increased keystroke savings in practice. Addition-
ally, users rely on better predictions more and thus
lose less of the potential keystroke savings offered
by the method. We expect that keystroke savings
will see substantial increases from improved poten-
tial keystroke savings until prediction utilization is
closer to 100%.
5 Conclusions
Word prediction in an experimental AAC device
with simulated AAC users significantly enhances
communication rate. The difference between an ad-
vanced and basic prediction method demonstrates
that further improvements in language modeling for
word prediction are likely to appreciably increase
communication rate. Therefore, further research in
improving word prediction is likely to have an im-
portant impact on quality-of-life for AAC users. We
plan to improve word prediction and validate these
results using AAC users as future work.
