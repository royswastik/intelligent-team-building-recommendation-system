Abstract
WordNet::Similarity is a freely available soft-
ware package that makes it possible to mea-
sure the semantic similarity and relatedness be-
tween a pair of concepts (or synsets). It pro-
vides six measures of similarity, and three mea-
sures of relatedness, all of which are based on
the lexical database WordNet. These measures
are implemented as Perl modules which take
as input two concepts, and return a numeric
value that represents the degree to which they
are similar or related.
1 Introduction
WordNet::Similarity implements measures of similarity
and relatedness that are all in some way based on the
structure and content of WordNet.
Measures of similarity use information found in an is?
a hierarchy of concepts (or synsets), and quantify how
much concept A is like (or is similar to) concept B. For
example, such a measure might show that an automobile
is more like a boat than it is a tree, due to the fact that
automobile and boat share vehicle as an ancestor in the
WordNet noun hierarchy.
WordNet is particularly well suited for similarity mea-
sures, since it organizes nouns and verbs into hierarchies
of is?a relations. In version 2.0, there are nine separate
noun hierarchies that include 80,000 concepts, and 554
verb hierarchies that are made up of 13,500 concepts.
Is?a relations in WordNet do not cross part of speech
boundaries, so similarity measures are limited to mak-
ing judgments between noun pairs (e.g., cat and dog) and
verb pairs (e.g., run and walk). While WordNet alo in-
cludes adjectives and adverbs, these are not organized
into is?a hierarchies so similarity measures can not be
applied.
However, concepts can be related in many ways be-
yond being similar to each other. For example, a wheel is
a part of a car, night is the opposite of day, snow is made
up of water, a knife is used to cut bread, and so forth. As
such WordNet provides relations beyond is?a, including
has?part, is?made?of, and is?an?attribute?of. In addi-
tion, each concept is defined by a short gloss that may
include an example usage. All of this information can be
brought to bear in creating measures of relatedness. As
a result these measures tend to be more flexible, and al-
low for relatedness values to be assigned across parts of
speech (e.g., the verb murder and the noun gun).
This paper continues with an overview of the mea-
sures supported in WordNet::Similarity, and then pro-
vides a brief description of how the package can be used.
We close with a summary of research that has employed
WordNet::Similarity.
2 Similarity Measures
Three of the six measures of similarity are based on the
information content of the least common subsumer (LCS)
of concepts A and B. Information content is a measure of
the specificity of a concept, and the LCS of concepts A
and B is the most specific concept that is an ancestor of
both A and B. These measures include res (Resnik, 1995),
lin (Lin, 1998), and jcn (Jiang and Conrath, 1997).
The lin and jcn measures augment the information con-
tent of the LCS with the sum of the information content
of concepts A and B themselves. The lin measure scales
the information content of the LCS by this sum, while
jcn takes the difference of this sum and the information
content of the LCS.
The default source for information content for concepts
is the sense?tagged corpus SemCor. However, there are
also utility programs available with WordNet::Similarity
that allow a user to compute information content values
from the Brown Corpus, the Penn Treebank, the British
National Corpus, or any given corpus of raw text.

Figure 1: Command Line Interface
Three similarity measures are based on path lengths
between a pair of concepts: lch (Leacock and Chodorow,
1998), wup (Wu and Palmer, 1994), and path. lch finds
the shortest path between two concepts, and scales that
value by the maximum path length found in the is?a hi-
erarchy in which they occur. wup finds the depth of the
LCS of the concepts, and then scales that by the sum of
the depths of the individual concepts. The depth of a con-
cept is simply its distance to the root node. The measure
path is a baseline that is equal to the inverse of the short-
est path between two concepts.
WordNet::Similarity supports two hypothetical root
nodes that can be turned on and off. When on, one root
node subsumes all of the noun concepts, and another sub-
sumes all of the verb concepts. This allows for similarity
measures to be applied to any pair of nouns or verbs. If
the hypothetical root nodes are off, then concepts must
be in the same physical hierarchy for a measurement to
be taken.
3 Measures of Relatedness
Measures of relatedness are more general in that they can
be made across part of speech boundaries, and they are
not limited to considering is-a relations. There are three
such measures in the package: hso (Hirst and St-Onge,
1998), lesk (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003), and vector
(Patwardhan, 2003).
The hso measures classifies relations in WordNet as
having direction, and then establishes the relatedness be-
tween two concepts A and B by finding a path that is
neither too long nor that changes direction too often.
The lesk and vector measures incorporate information
from WordNet glosses. The lesk measure finds overlaps
between the glosses of concepts A and B, as well as con-
cepts that are directly linked to A and B. The vector mea-
sure creates a co?occurrence matrix for each word used in
the WordNet glosses from a given corpus, and then repre-
sents each gloss/concept with a vector that is the average
of these co?occurrence vectors.
4 Using WordNet::Similarity
WordNet::Similarity can be utilized via a command line
interface provided by the utility program similarity.pl.
This allows a user to run the measures interactively. In
addition, there is a web interface that is based on this
utility. WordNet::Similarity can also be embedded within
Perl programs by including it as a module and calling its
methods.
4.1 Command Line
The utility similarity.pl allows a user to measure specific
pairs of concepts when given in word#pos#sense form.
For example, car#n#3 refers to the third WordNet noun
sense of car. It also allows for the specification of all
the possible senses associated with a word or word#pos
combination.
For example, in Figure 1, the first command requests
the value of the lin measure of similarity for the second
noun sense of car (railway car) and the first noun sense of
bus (motor coach). The second command will return the
score of the pair of concepts that have the highest similar-
ity value for the nouns car and bus. In the third command,
the ?allsenses switch causes the similarity measurements
of all the noun senses of car to be calculated relative to
the first noun sense of bus.
4.2 Programming Interface
WordNet::Similarity is implemented with Perl?s object
oriented features. It uses the WordNet::QueryData pack-
age (Rennie, 2000) to create an object representing Word-
Net. There are a number of methods available that allow
for the inclusion of existing measures in Perl source code,
and also for the development of new measures.
When an existing measure is to be used, an object of
that measure must be created via the new() method. Then
the getRelatedness() method can be called for a pair of
word senses, and this will return the relatedness value.
For example, the program in Figure 2 creates an object of
the lin measure, and then finds the similarity between the
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use WordNet::QueryData; # use interface to WordNet
use WordNet::Similarity::lin; # use Lin measure
$wnObj = new WordNet::QueryData; # create a WordNet object
$linObj = new WordNet::Similarity::lin($wnObj); # create a lin object
$value = $linObj -> getRelatedness (?car#n#1?, ?bus#n#2?); # how similar?
Figure 2: Programming Interface
first sense of the noun car (automobile) and the second
sense of the noun bus (network bus).
WordNet::Similarity enables detailed tracing that
shows a variety of diagnostic information specific to each
of the different kinds of measures. For example, for the
measures that rely on path lengths (lch, wup, path) the
tracing shows all the paths found between the concepts.
Tracing for the information content measures (res, lin,
jcn) includes both the paths between concepts as well as
the least common subsumer. Tracing for the hso measure
shows the actual paths found through WordNet, while
the tracing for lesk shows the gloss overlaps in Word-
Net found for the two concepts and their nearby relatives.
The vector tracing shows the word vectors that are used
to create the gloss vector of a concept.
5 Software Architecture
Similarity.pm is the super class of all modules, and pro-
vides general services used by all of the measures such as
validation of synset identifier input, tracing, and caching
of results. There are four modules that provide all of the
functionality required by any of the supported measures:
PathFinder.pm, ICFinder.pm, DepthFinder.pm, and LCS-
Finder.pm.
PathFinder.pm provides getAllPaths(), which finds all
of the paths and their lengths between two input synsets,
and getShortestPath() which determines the length of the
shortest path between two concepts.
ICFinder.pm includes the method IC(), which gets the
information content value of a synset. probability() and
getFrequency() find the probability and frequency count
of a synset based on whatever corpus has been used to
compute information content. Note that these values are
pre?computed, so these methods are simply reading from
an information content file.
DepthFinder.pm provides methods that read values that
have been pre?computed by the wnDepths.pl utility. This
program finds the depth of every synset in WordNet,
and also shows the is?a hierarchy in which a synset oc-
curs. If a synset has multiple parents, then each possible
depth and home hierarchy is returned. The depth of a
synset is returned by getDepthOfSynset() and getTaxono-
myDepth() provides the maximum depth for a given is?a
hierarchy.
LCSFinder.pm provides methods that find the least
common subsumer of two concepts using three differ-
ent criteria. These are necessary since there is multiple
inheritance of concepts in WordNet, and different LCS
can be selected for a pair of concepts if one or both of
them have multiple parents in an is?a hiearchy. getLCS-
byIC() chooses the LCS for a pair of concepts that has the
highest information content, getLCSbyDepth() selects the
LCS with the greatest depth, and getLCSbyPath() selects
the LCS that results in the shortest path.
6 Related Work
Our work with measures of semantic similarity and relat-
edness began while adapting the Lesk Algorithm for word
sense disambiguation to WordNet (Banerjee and Peder-
sen, 2002). That evolved in a generalized approach to
disambiguation based on semantic relatedness (Patward-
han et al, 2003) that is implemented in the SenseRe-
late package (http://senserelate.sourceforge.net), which
utilizes WordNet::Similarity. The premise behind this al-
gorithm is that the sense of a word can be determined by
finding which of its senses is most related to the possible
senses of its neighbors.
WordNet::Similarity has been used by a number of
other researchers in an interesting array of domains.
(Zhang et al, 2003) use it as a source of semantic fea-
tures for identifying cross?document structural relation-
ships between pairs of sentences found in related docu-
ments. (McCarthy et al, 2004) use it in conjunction with
a thesaurus derived from raw text in order to automati-
cally identify the predominent sense of a word. (Jarmasz
and Szpakowicz, 2003) compares measures of similarity
derived from WordNet and Roget?s Thesaurus. The com-
parisons are based on correlation with human related-
ness values, as well as the TOEFL synonym identification
tasks. (Baldwin et al, 2003) use WordNet::Similarity to
provide an evaluation tool for multiword expressions that
are identified via Latent Semantic Analysis. (Diab, 2003)
combines a number of similarity measures that are then
used as a feature in the disambiguation of verb senses.
