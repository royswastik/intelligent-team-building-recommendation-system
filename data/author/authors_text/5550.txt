Mandar Mitra, Prasenjit Majumder 
 
Abstract 
 
This talk will present our plans for organizing FIRE, a forum for Information 
Retrieval evaluation, focused on Indian languages. We will start by 
reviewing the basic experimental framework and metrics as represented by 
the Cranfield paradigm. An overview of the main evaluation fora for IR -- 
TREC, CLEF and NTCIR, which are all based on this paradigm, and from 
which FIRE draws inspiration -- will be given. The components of the 
evaluation framework, viz. corpora, search topics, and relevance judgments 
will also be discussed.
