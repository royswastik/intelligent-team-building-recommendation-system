Abstract 
WordSmith Tools (Scott, 1998) offers a 
program for comparing corpora, known as 
KeyWords. KeyWords compares a word list 
extracted from what has been called 'the 
study corpus' (the corpus which the 
researcher is interested in describing) with a 
word list made from a reference corpus. The 
only requirement for a word list to be 
accepted as reference corpus by the software 
is that must be larger than the study corpus. 
one of the most pressing questions with 
respect to using KeyWords eems to be what 
would be the ideal size of a reference 
corpus. The aim of this paper is thus to 
propose answers to this question. Five 
English corpora were compared to reference 
corpora of various sizes (varying from two 
to 100 times larger than the study corpus). 
The results indicate that a reference corpus 
that is five times as large as the study corpus 
yielded a larger number of keywords than a 
smaller reference corpus. Corpora larger 
than five times the size of the study corpus 
yielded similar amounts of keywords. The 
implication is that a larger eference corpus 
is not always better than a smaller one, for 
WordSmith Tools Keywords analysis, while 
a reference corpus that is less than five times 
the size of the study corpus may not be 
reliable. There seems to be no need for using 
extremely arge reference corpora, given that 
the number of keywords yielded do not 
seem to change by using corpora larger than 
five times the size of the study corpus. 
Introduction 
WordSmith Tools (Scott, 1998) offers a 
program for comparing corpora, known as 
KeyWords. This tool has been used in several 
studies as a means for describing various lexico- 
grammatical characteristics of different genres 
(Barbara nd Scott, 1999; Batista, 1998; Berber 
Sardinha, 1995, 1999a, b; Berber Sardinha nd 
Shimazumi, 1998; Bonamin, 1999; Collins and 
Scott, 1996; Conde, 1999; Dutra, 1999; Freitas, 
1997; Fuzetti, 1999; Granger and Tnbble, 1998; 
Lima-Lopes, 1999; Lopes, 2000; Ramos, 1997; 
Santos, 1999; Scott, 1997; Silva, 1999; Tribble, 
1998). The keywords identified by the program 
are not necessarily the 'most important words' in 
the corpus (Scott, 1997), or those that 
correspond to readers' intuitions as to what the 
topics of the texts are. It is generally thought that 
a set of WordSmith Tools keywords indicate 
'aboutness' (Phillips, 1989). 
KeyWords compares a word list extracted 
from what has been called 'the study corpus' 
(the corpus which the researcher is interested in
describing) with a word list made from a 
reference corpus. The result is a list of 
keywords, or words whose frequencies are 
statistically higher in the study corpus than in 
the reference corpus. The software also 
identifies words whose frequencies are 
statistically ower in the study corpus, which are 
called 'negative keywords', in contrast to 
positive keywords, which have higher 
frequencies in the study corpus. Negative 
keywords, though, will not be discussed in the 
present paper. Hence, whenever keyword is 
mentioned in this paper, it will mean 'positive 
keyword'. 
The only requirement for a word list to be 
accepted as reference corpus by the software is 
that must be larger than the study corpus. Thus, 
the composition and length of KeyWord lists can 
vary according to at least six parameters: 
? The composition of the study corpus. 
? The composition of the reference 
corpus. 
? The size of the study corpus;. 
? The size of the reference corpus. 
? The statistical test used in the 
comparison of frequencies (log- 
likelihood and chi-square are available). 
? The level of significance (p) used as the 
'keyness' benchmark (the cut-off point). 
Since WordSmith Tools is Windows software, 
it has appealed to a large audience of applied 
linguists willing to do corpus-based research, to 
whom this platform is generally the only one 
that they know how to use. To them, one of the 
most pressing questions with respect o using 
KeyWords seems to be what would be the ideal 
size of a reference corpus. The aim of this paper 
is thus to propose answers to this question. 
1 Using KeyWords 
A KeyWord list is a portion of the study 
corpus word list. KeyWords compares the 
frequencies for each type in the study and 
reference corpora. The program calculates the 
log-likelihood (G2) 1 or Chi-Square (X 2) of each 
word form based on its distribution in both 
corpora, an example of which is given in the 
table below. 
Study

Remaining 
word forms 
Total 
90 (90%) 100 
(100%) 
1000 (99%) 1010 
(100%) 
For a distribution such as the above, both the 
log-likelihood and chi-square statistics would 
probably flag the word form in question as a 
keyword, since its frequencies in the two 
corpora are so different (10% versus 1%). The 
way KeyWords processes word lists is not 
unique, and has been applied by researchers 
using other software (De Cock, Granger, Leech, 
and McEnery, 1998; Granger and Rayson, 1998; 
Milton, 1998). 
After processing the word lists, the keyword 
lists appear in WordSmith Tools as illustrated 
below.

2 Methodology 
In order to answer this question, the following 
English corpora were used: 
? Corpus of job application letters, taken 
from the DIRECT Corpus 2. 
? Corpus of newspaper editorials, from 
the Brown Corpus ('B" subcorpus). 
? Corpus of newspaper reviews, from the 
Brown Corpus ('C' subcorpus). 
? Corpus of mystery fiction, from the 
Brown Corpus ('L" subcorpus). 
? Corpus of science fiction, from the 
Brown Corpus ('M' subcorpus). 
These five corpora added up to about 162 
thousand words:

The reference corpora were compiled out of 
texts published in 'The Guardian'. The reason 
for choosing it is that newspaper text is the most 
typical kind of reference corpus used by applied 
linguists, mainly because it is easy to get. 
Therefore, the results obtained here would be 
relevant to the typical user of KeyWords. The 
reason for specifically choosing the Guardian is 
that Mike Scott, the author of WordSmith Tools, 
makes it available on his website a word list of 
95 million tokens of The Guardian text on his 
website. This has become a popular choice for 
several WordSmith Tools users investigating 
English keywords. Once again, it was hoped that 
by using The Guardian, the investigation would 
mirror a typical choice of WordSmith users. For 
the present study, a portion of the Guardian 
word list was used, namely from texts published 
in 1994, taken randomly. 
The size of the reference corpora varied 
according to the size of the study corpora. For 
each study corpus, 18 reference corpora were 
created. Each one was n times larger than the 
study corpus, with n being 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100. For 
instance, the letters corpus had 11,761 tokens, 
and so for n=2 the size of the reference corpus 
was 23,552 tokens (11,761 * 2); for n=3, the 
reference corpus size was 35,283 (11,761 x 3), 
for n=4 47,044, and so on, up to n=100, whose 
size was 1,176,100 words.

3 Results 
The results for the total number of keywords 
obtained are shown in the following table. Since 
the study corpora were of different sizes, the 
number of keywords is also shown as a 
percentage of the total types of the study corpus. 
For instance, the letters corpus had 2,415 types; 
the number of keywords obtained comparing 
this corpus to the n=2 reference corpus was 279; 
therefore, this corresponds to 11.6% of the total 
types.

Table 3: Keyword totals (% = pct. of the total number of types in the study corpus). 
The results indicate that he number of keywords 
increases as the size of the reference corpus 
increases, but this increase is not linear. For 
instance, the keywords for n=2 in the letters 
corpus was 279, for n=3 it was 347, and for n= 
100 the total keywords was 475. Had the growth 
been linear, for n=3 there would be 418 
keywords, and for n=100 13,950. Obviously, a 
total of 13,950 keywords could never have been 
obtained since die maximum possible number of 
10 
keywords in the letters corpus is 2,415, which is 
the total number of types. The same is true of all 
the other corpora. 
This suggests that there must be a point at 
which the growth in number of keywords 
diminishes. This can be shown by plotting the 
number of keywords for each size of n across all 
the study corpora, as in the graph below.

Plot 1: Distribution of keywords 
The plot shows that for all study corpora the 
keyword totals rose from n=2 to n=3, then fell or 
stabilized at n=4, rose again at n=5 and from 
then on basically reached aplateau. For instance, 
for the letters corpus, the keyword totals for n=2, 
n=3, n=4, n=5, and n=6 were respectively 11.6, 
14.4, 14.7, 19.9, and 19.9. Hence, there was 
indeed a considerable rise from n=2 to n=3 (11.6 
to 14.4), followed by a slight rise at n=4 (14.7), 
then a major increase at n=5 (19.9), and there 
was no change from n=5 to n=6 (19.9 to 19.9). 
In order to check where the major changes 
occurred, an ANOVA was run on the keyword 
totals across the various n sizes. The results are 
shown in the table below.

The value of F(21,68)=267.98 is significant at 
p<0.0001, which indicates that size of the 
reference corpora had a significant effect on the 
keyword totals. This does not show us the 
differences in keyword totals among n sizes. 
In order to know at which n sizes the keyword 
totals are statistically different, the REGWF

was run in SAS. The results appear in the table

Table 5: Results of REGWF test 
The REGWF test presents the results in terms 
of groupings, identified by letters. Keyword 
totals in the same grouping are not statistically 
different. Hence, sizes of n equal to 40, 60, 20, 
100, 80, 90, 30, 70, 50, 5, and 6 formed 
grouping A, which has on average 14.066% to 
14.884% keyword totals. Likewise, n sizes equal 
to 70, 50, 5, 6, and 8 were in grouping B, with 
averages ranging from 13.686% to 14.694%. 
Note that this is overlap among groupings, and 
so groupings A, B, C and D are in fact joined. 
This grouping comprises n sizes ranging from 5 
to 100. The remaining groupings are non- 
overlapping: grouping E was formed by n sizes 
3 and 4, and grouping F by n=2. 
Therefore, there are two basic divisions in the 
previous table, namely at n sizes equal to 2, 3, 
11 
and 5. These correspond tothe major peaks and 
plateaus visible in the plot. 
The results uggest, hen, that he critical value 
for a reference corpus eems to be five. In other 
words, the answer to the question 'what is the 
ideal size of a reference corpus' is five. A 
reference corpus that is five times as large as the 
study corpus yields a larger number of keywords 
than a smaller eference corpus. This means that 
the results of a keyword analysis based on a 
reference corpus that is less than five times the 
size of the study corpus could be very different 
from a study done on a corpus, say, just three 
times larger than the study corpus, in so far as 
the number ofkeywords go. Several potentially 
revealing keywords could be left out of the 
analysis iftbe reference corpus is not as large as 
five times or more. 
Condusion 
The aim of this study was to estimate the ideal 
size of a reference corpus to be used in 
WordSmith Tools KeyWords procedure. 
KeyWords provides facilities for comparing a 
study corpus to a reference corpus, which, by 
default, must be larger than study corpus. 
The results indicated that a reference corpus 
that is five times larger than the study corpus 
yields a similar amount of keywords than 
reference corpora that are up to 100 times larger 
than the study corpus. This was taken to mean 
that a reference corpus does not need to be more 
than five times larger than the study corpus. 
In sum, a larger eference corpus is not always 
better than a smaller one, for WordSmith Tools 
Keywords analysis. There seems to be no need 
for using extremely large reference corpora, 
given that the number of keywords yielded do 
not seem to change by using corpora larger than 
five times the size of the study corpus. This may 
be important for WordSmith Tools users, who 
may be short of disk space and memory on their 
PCs to process large reference corpora. A 
suggestion that might come out of this finding is 
that researchers should not spend time and 
resources building, collecting or searching for 
larger and larger eference corpora. Resources 
would be better spent in the compilation of 
reference corpora that are more suitable in terms 
of their contents viz ~ viz the study corpus. 
This study did not tackle several important 
questions. One of them is whether the keywords 
that were identified represent the main concepts 
or topics found the texts. Aqualitative study 
would be needed to answer this, as an 
independent test of validity of the status of the 
keywords. Another question is the effect of the 
size of the study corpus. It is not known how 
study corpora of the same size behave in terms 
of the total keywords that they yield when 
compared to reference corpora of the same size. 
Another question is the composition of the 
keyword lists obtained. This study restricted 
itself to quantitative aspects of keyword list 
variation, but it would be important that changes 
be assessed qualitatively as well. In particular, it
would be pertinent to know which keywords 
were added or dropped as the levels of n 
changed ~.Finally, the fact that Brown corpus 
texts are short fragments and not whole texts 
may have upset he results, since the number of 
keywords seems to vary considerably as a 
function of the size of the texts (Mike Scott, 
personal communication). Shorter texts provide 
less room for repetition, which in turn influences 
word frequencies.
