Abstract 
We present an implemented concept-to-speech 
(CTS) syst@n'~J tl~at offers original proposals for 
certain couplings-oi r dialogue computation with 
prosodic computation. Specifically, the semantic in- 
terpretation, task modeling and dialogue strategy 
modules in a working spoken dialogue system are 
used to generate prosodic features to better convey 
the meaning of system replies. The new CTS system 
embodies and extends theoretical work on intona- 
tional meaning in a more general, robust and rigor- 
ous way than earlier approaches, by reflecting com- 
positional aspects of both dialogue and intonation 
interepretation i  an original computational frame- 
work for prosodic generation. 
1 In t roduct ion  
Conversational systems that use speech as the input 
and output modality are often realized by architec- 
tures that decouple speech processing components 
from language processing components. In this pa- 
per, we show how speech generation can be more 
closely coupled with the dialogue manager of a work- 
ing mixed-initiative spoken dialogue system. In par- 
ticular, we use representations from the semantic in- 
terpretation, task model and dialogue strategy mod- 
ules to better communicate the meaning of system 
replies through prosodically appropriate synthetic 
speech. 
While dialogue prosody has been a topic of much 
study, our implemented concept-to-speech (CTS) 
system offers original proposals for specific couplings 
of dialogue computation with prosodic omputation. 
Further, it embodies and extends theoretical work 
on intonational meaning in a more general, robust 
and rigorous way than earlier CTS systems, in an 
architecture that reflects compositional aspects of 
dialogue and intonation interpretation. 
2 Theoretical Foundations 
In this work, we implement and extend the com- 
positional theory of intonational meaning proposed 
by Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg (1986; 1990), 
who sought o identify correspondences between the

Grosz and Sidner (1986) computational model of dis- 
course interpretation and Pierrehumbert's prosodic 
grammar for American English (1980). 
In the present work, certain aspects of the orig- 
inal theories are modified and adapted to the ar- 
chitecture of the dialogue system in which the CTS 
component is embedded. Below, we present he im- 
portant fundamental definitions and principles of in- 
tonation underlying our CTS system. 
2.1 Intonat ional  System 
In our CTS system, the prosodic elements that are 
computed are based on the intonational system of 
Pierrehumbert (1980), who defined a formal lan- 
guage for describing American English intonation 
using the following regular grammar: 
Inton Phrase ---~ (Interm Phrase) + Bndry Tone 
Interm Phrase ~ (Pitch Acc)+ Phrase Ace 
Major phrases, or inlonational phrases, are made 
up of one or more minor phrases, or inlermediale 
phrases. Melodic movements in intermediate and 
intonational phrases are in turn expressed by three 
kinds of tonal elements. These include six pilch ac- 
cents: a low pitch excursion (L*), a high pitch excur- 
sion (H*), or a combination of both low and high ex- 
cursions (L*+H, L+H*, H*+L, It+L*); two phrase 
accents: a high (H-) or low (L-) tonal target that 
guides the interpolation of the melodic ontour from 
final pitch accent o intermediate phrase nding; and 
two boundary lones: a high (H%) or low (L%) tonal 
target that guides interpolation from phrase accent 
to intonational phrase ending. 
2.2 Intonat ional  Meaning 
Theoretical work on intonational meaning has at- 
tempted to relate the grammatical e ements of Pier- 
rehumbert's system - -  pitch accent, phrase accent 
and boundary tone, to interpretive processes at dif- 
ferent levels of discourse and dialogue structure. 
Hirschberg and Pierrehumbert (1986) conjectured 
that the absence or presence of accentuation conveys 
discourse focus status, while the tonal properties of 
the accent itself (i.e. pitch accent ype) convey se- 
mantic focus information.

In later work, pitch accent type was said to 
express whether the accented information was in- 
tended by the speaker to be "predicated" or not by 
the hearer (Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg, 1990). 
Nompredicated-~forernation was said to bear low- 
star accentuation (L*-, L*+H, H+L*), while predi- 
cated information would be marked by high-star ac- 
cents (H*, L+H*, H*+L). The theory further stated 
that L*+H conveys uncertainty or lack of speaker 
commitment to the expressed propositional content, 
while L+H* marks correction or contrast. The com- 
plex accent, H*+L, was said to convey that an infer- 
ence path was required to support he predication; 
usage of H+L* similarly was said to imply an in- 
ference path, but did not suggest a predication of a 
mutual belief. Finally, phrase accents and bound- 
ary tones were said to reflect aspects of discourse 
structure. 
3 Systems Foundations 
Our task is to improve the communicative compe- 
tence of a spoken dialogue agent, by making re- 
course to our knowledge of intonational meaning, di- 
alogue processing and relations between the two. Of 
course, a worthwhile CTS system must also outper- 
form out-of-the-box text-to-speech (TTS) systems 
that may determine prosodic mark-up in linguisti- 
cally sophisticated ways. As in (Nakatani, 1998), we 
take the prosodic output of an advanced research 
system that implements he Pierrehumbert theory 
of intonation, namely the Bell Labs TTS system, 
as our baseline xperimental system to be enhanced 
by CTS algorithms. We embed the CTS system in 
MIMIC, a working spoken dialogue system repre- 
senting state-of-the-art dialogue management prac- 
tices, to develop CTS algorithms that can be eventu- 
ally realistically evaluated using task-based perfor- 
mance metrics. 
3.1 Dialogue System: Mixed-Init iat ive 
Movie Information Consultant 
(MIMIC)  
The dialogue system whose baseline speech gen- 
eration capabilities we enhance is the Mixed- 
Initiative Movie Information Consultant (MIMIC) 
(Chu-Carroll, 2000). MIMIC" provides movie list- 
ing information involving knowledge about towns, 
theaters, movies and showtimes, as demonstrated 
in Figure 1. MIMIC currently utilizes template- 
driven text generation, and passes on text strings 
to a stand-alone TTS system. In the version of 
MIMIC enhanced with concept-to-speech capabili- 
ties, MIMIC-CTS, contextual knowledge is used to 
modify the prosodic features of the slot and filler 
material in the templates; we are currently integrat- 
ing the algorithms in MIMIC-CTS with a grammar- 
driven generation system. Further details of MIMIC 
are presented in the relevant sections below, but see 
(Chu-Carroll, 2000) for a complete overview. 
3.2 TTS: The Bell Labs System 
For default prosodic processing and speech synthe- 
sis realization, we use a research version of the 
Bell Labs TTS System, circa 1992 (Sproat, 1997), 
that generates intonational contours based on Pier- 
rehumbert's intonation theory (1980), as described 
in (Pierrehumbert, 1981). Of relevance is the fact 
that various pitch accent ypes, phrase accent and 
boundary tones in Pierrehumbert's theory are di- 
rectly implemented in this system, so that by gener- 
ating a Pierrehumbert-style prosodic transcription, 
the work of the CTS system is done. More pre- 
cisely, MIMIC-CTS computes prosodic annotations 
that override the default prosodic processing that is 
performed by the Bell Labs TTS system. 
To our knowledge, the intonation component of 
the Bell Labs TTS system utilizes more linguistic 
knowledge to compute prosodic annotations than 
any other unrestricted TTS system, so it is reason- 
able to assume that improvements upon it are mean- 
ingful in practice as well as in theory. 
4 MIMIC's Concept-to-Speech 
Component  (MIMIC-CTS) 
In MIMIC-CTS, the MIMIC dialogue system is en- 
hanced with a CTS component to better communi- 
cate the meaning of system replies through contex- 
tually conditioned prosodic features. MIMIC-CTS 
makes use of three distinct levels of dialogue rep- 
resentations to convey meaning through intonation. 
MIMIC's semantic representations allow MIMIC- 
CTS to decide which information to prosodically 
49 
highlight. MIMIC's task model in turn determines 
how to prosodically highlight selected information, 
based on the pragmatic properties of the system 
reply. MIMIC's dialogue strategy selection process 
informs various choices in prosodic contour and ac- 
centing that convey logico-semantic aspects of mean- 
ing, such as contradiction. 
4.1 Highl ighting Informat ion using 
Semantic Representat ions 
MIMIC employs a statistically-driven semantic in- 
terpretation engine to "spot" values for key at- 
tributes that make up a valid MIMIC query in a 
robust fashion) To simplify matters, for each ut- 
terance, MIMIC computes an attribute-value ma- 
trix (AVM)-~epresentation, identifying important 
pieces of information for accomplishing a given set 
of tasks. The AVM created from the following ut- 
terance, "When is October Sky playing at Hoboken 
Cinema in Hoboken?", for example, is given in Fig- 
ure 2. 
Attribute 11 Value 
Task 
Movie 
Theatre 
Town 
Time 
when 
October Sky 
Hoboken Cinema 
Hoboken 
Figure 2: Attribute Value Matrix (AVM), computed 
by MIMIC's semantic interpreter. 
Attribute names and attribute values are critical 
to the task at hand. In MIMIC-CTS, attribute 
names and values that occur in templates are typed, 
so that MIMIC-CTS can highlight hese items in 
the following way: 
1. All lexical items realizing attribute values are 
accented. 
2. Attribute values are synthesized at a slower 
speaking rate. 
3. Attribute values are set off by phrase bound- 
aries. 
4. Attribute names are always accented. 
These modifications are entirely rule-based, given a 
list of attribute names and typed attribute values. 
1 Specifically, MIMIC uses an n-dimensional call router 
front-end (Chu-Carroll, 2000), which is a generalization of 
the vector-based call-routing paradigm of semantic interpre- 
tation (Chu-CarroU and Carpenter, 1999); that is, instead of 
detecting one concept per utterance, MIMIC's semantic in- 
terpretation engine detects multiple (n) concepts or classes 
conveyed by a single utterance, by using n call touters in 
parallel. 
Even such minimal use of dialogue information 
can make a difference. For example, changing the 
default accent for the following utterance highlights 
the kind of information that the system is seeking, 
instead of highlighting the semantically vacuous 
main verb, like: 2 
Default TTS: what movie would you LIKE 
MIMIC-CTS: what MOVIE would you like 
4.2 Conveying In format ion Status using 
the Task Model 
MIMIC performs a set of information-giving tasks, 
i.e. what, where, when, location, that are concisely 
defined by a task model. MIMIC processes the 
AVM for each utterance and then evaluates whether 
it should perform a database query based on the 
task specifications given in Figure 3. The task 
mode\] defines which attribute values must be filled 
in (Y), must not 56 filled in (N), or may optionally 
be filled in (-), to "license" a database query action. 
If no task is "specified" by the current AVM state, 
Task Movie Theater Town 
Figure 3: Task Specifications for MIMIC. 
MIMIC employs various strategies to progress 
toward a complete and valid task specification. 
For example, in response to the follgwing user 
utterance, MIMIC initiates an information-seeking 
subdialogue to instantiate the theater attribute 
value to accomplish a when task: 
User: when is october sky playing 
in hoboken 
MIMIC-CTS: what THEATER would you like 
To better convey the structure of the task model, 
which is learned by the user through interaction 
with the system, we define four information statuses 
based on properties of the task model, which align 
on a scale of given and new in the following order: 
OLD INFERRABLE KEY HEARER-NEW 
\[given\] \[new\] 
KEY information is that which is necessary to 
formulate a valid database query, and is exchanged 
and (implicitly or explicitly) confirmed between 
the system and user. INFERRABLE information is
not explicitly exchanged between the system and

user, but is derived by MIMIC's limited inference 
engine that seeks to instantiate as many attribute 
values as possible. For instance, a theater name 
may be inferred given a town name, if there is only 
one theater in the given town. OLD information 
is inherited from the discourse history, based on 
updating rules relying on confidence scores for 
attribute values. HEARER-NEW information (c.f. 
(Prince, 1988)) is that which is requested by the 
user, and constitutes the only new information on 
the scale. But note that KEY information, while 
given, is still clearly in discourse focus, along with 
HEARER-NEW information. 
The next step is to map the information statuses, 
ordered from given to new, to a scale of pitch 
accent, or accent melodies, ordered from given to 
new as follows: 
L* L*?H L+H* H* 
&ivan\] \[new\] 
Table 1 summarizes this original mapping of infor- 
mation statuses to pitch accent melodies, and Fig- 
ure 4 illustrates the use of this mapping in an ex- 
ample. It obeys the general principle of Pierrehum- 
bert and Hirschberg's work, that low tonality sig- 
nifies discourse givenness and high tonality signifies 
discourse newness, but extends this principle beyond 
its vague definition in terms of predication of mutual 
beliefs. Instead, the principle is operationalized here 
in a practically motivated manner that is consistent 
with and perhaps illuminating of the theory. 
4.3 Ass igning "D ia logue  Prosody"  us ing 
Dia logue St rateg ies  
As in earlier CTS systems, special logico-semantic 
relations, such as contrast or correction, are effec- 
tively conveyed in MIMIC-CTS by prosodic ues. In 
MIMIC-CTS, however, these situations are not stip- 
ulated in an ad hoc manner, but can be determined 
to a large degree by MIMIC's dialogue strategy se- 
lection process that identifies appropriate dialogue 
acts to realize a dialogue goal. a 
For example, the dialogue act ANSWER may be 
selected to achieve the dialogue goal of providing an 
answer to a successful user query, while the dialogue 
act NOTIFYFAILURE may be performed to achieve 
the dialogue goal of providing an answer in situations 
where no movie listing in the database matches the 
user query. The template associated with the di- 
alogue act, NOTIFYFAILURE, when compared with 
that for ANSWER, contains an additional negative 
auxiliary associated with the key attribute responsi- 
ble for the query failure, in an utterance conveying a
contradiction i beliefs between the user and system 
(namely, the presupposition on the part of the user 
that the query can be satisfied). 
Theoretical work on intonational interpretation 
leads us to prosodically mark the negative auxil- 
iary, as well as the associated focus position (Rooth, 
1985). We choose to mark the negative auxiliary not 
with the L+H* pitch accent to convey correction, 
while marking the material in the associated focus 
position with the L*+H pitch accent to convey (the

tion algorithm takes into account the outcome of an initia- 
tive tracking module that we do not discuss here (see (Chu-

dialogue act is conveyed by assigning the so-called

the utterance-at large (c.f. (Hirschberg and Ward, 
1991)). An example generated by MIMIC-CTS ap- 
pears in Figure 5. Note that pitch accent types for 
the remaining attribute values are assigned using the 
task model, as described in section 4.2. Thus in Fig- 
ure 5, the movie title is treated as KEY information, 
marked by the L+H* pitch accent. 
MIMIC-CTS contains additional prosodic rules 
for logical connectives, and clarification and confir- 
mation suhdialogues. 
5 Related Work 
Although a number of earlier CTS systems have 
captured linguistic phenomena that we address in 
our work, the computation ofprosody from dialogue 
representations is often not as rigorous, detailed or 
complete as in MIMIC-CTS. Further, while several 
systems use given/new information status to decide 
whether to accent or deaccent a lexical item, no sys- 
tem has directly implemented general rules for pitch 
accent type assignment. Together, MIMIC-CTS's 
computation of accentuation, pitch accent ype and 
dialogue prosody constitutes the most general and 
complete implementation f a compositional theory 
of intonational meaning in a CTS system to date. 
Nevertheless, elements of a handful of previ- 
ous CTS systems support the approaches taken 
in MIMIC-CTS toward conveying semantic, task 
and dialogue level meaning. For example, the Di- 
rection Assistant system (Davis and Hirschberg, 
1988) mapped a hand-crafted route grammar to a 
discourse structure for generated irections. The 
discourse structure determined accentuation, with 
deaccenting ofdiscourse-old entities realized (by lex- 
ically identical morphs) in the current or previous 
discourse segment. Other material was assigned ac- 
centuation based on lexical category information, 
with the exception that certain contrastive cases of 
accenting, such as left versus right, were stipulated 
for the domain. 
Accent assignment in the SUNDIAL travel infor- 
mation system (House and Yond, 1990) also relied 
on discourse and task models. Mutually known en- 
tities, said to be in negative focus, were deaccented; 
entities in the current task space, in referring focus, 
received (possibly contrastive) accenting; and enti- 
ties of the same type as a previously mentioned ob- 
ject, were classified-as in either referring or emphatic 
focus, depending on the dialogue act~ in the cases 
of corrective situations or repeated system-intitiated 
queries, the contrasting or corrective items were em- 
phatically accented. 
The BRIDGE project on speech generation 
(Zacharski etal., 1992) identified four main factors 
affecting accentability: linear 0rder, lexical category, 
semantic weight and givenness. In relatedwork 
(Monaghan, 1994), word accentability was quanti- 
tatively scored by hand-crafted rules based on infor- 
mation status, semantic focus and Word class. The 
givenness hierarchy of Gundel and'colleagues (1989), 
which associates lexical forms of expression with in- 
formation statuses, was divided into four intervals, 
with scores assigned to each. A binary semantic fo- 
cus score was based on whether the word occurred 
in the topic or comment of a sentence. Finally, lex- 
ical categories determined word class scores. These 
scores were combined, and metrical phonological 
rules then referred to final acce'ntability scores to 
assign a final accenting pattern. 
To summarize, all of the above CTS systems em- 
ploy either hand-crafted or heuristic techniques for 
representing semantic and discourse focus informa- 
tion. Further, only SUNDIAL makes use of dialogue 
acts. 
6 Conc lus ion  and Future  Work  
We are presently carrying out evaluations ofMIMIC- 
CTS. An initial corpus-based analysis compares 
the prosodic annotations assigned to three ac- 
tual MIMIC dialogues, which were previously col- 
lected during an overall system evaluation (Chu- 
Carroll and Nickerson, 2000). The corpus of di- 
alogues is made up of 37 system/user turns, in- 
cluding 40 system-generated sentences. Three ver- 
sions of the MIMIC dialogues are being analysed, 
with prosodic features arising from three differ- 
52 
ent sources: MIMIC-CTS, MIMIC operating with 
default Bell Labs TTS, and a professional voice 
talent who read the dialogue scripts in context. 
This corpus-based assessment - -  comparing the 
prosody of CTS-generated, TTS-generated, and hu- 
man speech, will enable more domain-dependent 
tuning of the MIMIC-CTS algorithms, as well as the 
refinement of general prosodic patterns for linguis- 
tic structures, uch as lists and conjunctive phrases. 
Ultimately; the value of MIMIC-CTS must be mea- 
sured based on its contribution to overall task pefor- 
mance by real MIMIC users. Such a study is under 
design, following (Chu-Carroll and Nickerson, 2000). 
In conclusion, we have shown how prosodic com- 
putation can be conditioned on various dialogue 
representations, for robust and domain-independent 
CTS synthesis. -While some rules for prosody as- 
signment depend on the task model, others must be 
tied closely to the particular choices of content in 
the replies, at the level of dialogue goals and dia- 
logue acts. At this level as well, however, linguis- 
tic principles of intonation interpretation can be ap- 
plied to determine the mappings. In sum, the lesson 
learned is that a unitary notion of "concept" from 
which we generate a unitary prosodic structure, does 
not apply to state-of-the-art spoken dialogue gener- 
ation. Instead, the representation f dialogue mean- 
ing in experimental rchitectures, such as MIMIC's, 
is compositional tosome degree, and we take advan- 
tage of this fact to implement a compositional theory 
of intonational meaning in a new concept-to-speech 
system, MIMIC-CTS.
