In Czech corpora compound verb groups are 
usually tagged in word-by-word manner. As a 
consequence, some of the morphological tags of 
particular components of the verb group lose 
their original meaning. We present a method for 
automatic recognition of compound verb groups 
in Czech. From an annotated corpus 126 def- 
inite clause grammar rules were constructed. 
These rules describe all compound verb groups 
that are frequent in Czech. Using those rules 
we can find compound verb groups in unanno- 
tated texts with the accuracy 93%. Tagging 
compound verb groups in an annotated corpus 
exploiting the verb rules is described.

1 Compound Verb  Groups  
Recognition and analysis of the predicate in a 
sentence is fundamental for the meaning of the 
sentence and its further analysis. In more than 
half of Czech sentences the predicate contains 
the compound verb group. E.g. in the sentence 
Mrzl m~, 2e jsem o td konferenci nev~d~la, byla 
bych se j l  zdSastnila. (literary translation: I am 
sorry that I did not know about the conference, 
I would have participated in it.) there are three 
verb groups 
<vg> Mrzl  </vg> m~, 5e <vg> jsem o td kon- 
ferenci nev~d~la </vg>,  <vg> byla bych se j l  
zdSastnila. </vg> 
I <vg> am sorry </vg> that I <vg> did 
not know </vg> about the conference, I <vg> 
would have participated </vg> in it. 
Verb groups are often split into more parts with 
so called gap words. In the second verb group 
the gap words are o td konferenci (about the 
conference). In annotated Czech corpora, in- 
cluding DESAM (Pala et al, 1997), compound 
verb groups are usually tagged in word-by-word 
manner. As a consequence, some of the morpho- 
logical tags of particular components of the verb 
group loose their original meaning. It means 
that the tags are correct for a single word but 
they do not reflect the meaning of the words in 
context. In the above sentence the word jsem 
is tagged as a verb in present ense, but the 
whole verb group to which it belongs - jsem 
nev~d~la - is in past tense. Similar situation ap- 
pears in byla bych se j l  zdSastnila (I would have 
participated in it) where zdSastnila is tagged as 
past tense while it is only a part of past condi- 
tional. Without finding all parts of a compound 
verb group and without agging the whole group 
(what is necessary dependent on other parts of 
the compound verb group) it is impossible to 
continue with any kind of semantic analysis. 
We consider a compound verb group to be a 
list of verbs and maybe the reflexive pronouns 
se, si. Such a group is obviously compound of 
auxiliary and full-meaning verbs, e.g. budu se 
um~vat where budu is auxiliary verb (like will in 
English), se is the reflexive pronoun and um~vat 
means to wash. As word-by-word tagging of 
verb groups is confusing, it is useful to find and  
assign a new tag to the whole group. This tag 
should contain information about the beginning 
and the end of the group and about the particu- 
lar components of the verb group. It must also 
contain information about relevant grammati- 
cal categories that characterise the verb group 
as a whole. In (Zg~kov~ and Pala, 1999), a pro- 
posal of the method for automatic finding of 
219 
compound verb groups in the corpus DESAM 
is introduced. We describe here the improved 
method that results in definite clause grammar 
rules - called verb rules - that contain informa- 
tion about all components of a particular verb 
group and about tags. We describe also some 
improvements hat allow us to increase the ac- 
curacy of verb group recognition. 
The paper is organised as follows. Corpus DE- 
SAM is described in Section 2. Section 3 con- 
tains a description of the method for learning 
verb rules. Recognition of verb groups in anno- 
tated text is discussed in Section 4. Improve- 
ments of this method are introduced in Sec- 
tion 5. In Section 6 we briefly show how the 
tag for the compound verb group is constructed 
employing verb rules. We conclude with dis- 
cussion (Section 7), the description of ongoing 
research (Section 8) and with a summary of rel- 
evant works (Section 9). 
2 Data  Source  
DESAM (Pala et al, 1997), the annotated and 
fully disambiguated corpus of Czech newspaper 
texts, has been used as the source of learning 
data. It contains more than 1 000 000 word 
positions, about 130 000 different word forms, 
about 65 000 of them occurring more then once, 
and 1 665 different ags. E.g. in Tab. 1 the tag 
kbeApFnStMmPaP of the word zd6astnila (partic- 
ipated) means: part of speech (k) = verb (5), 
person (p) = feminine (F), number (n) = sin- 
gular (S) and tense (t) = past (M). Lemmata 
and possible tags are prefixed by <1>, <t> re- 
spectively. As pointed out in (Pala et al, 1997; 
PopeHnsk~ et al, 1999), DESAM is not large 
enough. It does not contain the representative 
set of Czech sentences yet. In addition some 
words are tagged incorrectly and about 1/5 po- 
sitions are untagged. 
3 Learn ing  Verb  Ru les  
The algorithm for learning verb rules (Z?bkov? 
and Pala, 1999) takes as its input annotated 
sentences from corpus DESAM. The algorithm 
is split into three steps: finding w~rb chunks 
(i.e. finding boundaries of simple clauses in 
compound or in complex sentences, and elim- 
ination of gap words), generalisation and verb 
rule synthesis. These three steps are described 
below.

Table 1: Example of the disambiguated Czech 
sentence 
3.1 Verb Chunks  
The observed properties of a verb group are the 
following: their components are either verbs or 
a reflexive pronoun se (si); the boundary of a 
verb group cannot be crossed by the boundary 
of a sentence; and between two components of 
the verb group there can be a gap consisting of 
an arbitrary number of non-verb words or even a 
whole sentence. In the first step, the boundaries 
of all sentences are found. Then each gap is 
replaced by tag gap. 
The method exploits only the lemma of each 
word (nominative singular for nouns, adjectives, 
pronouns and numerals, infinitive for verbs) and 
its tag. We will demonstrate he whole process 
using the third simplex sentence of the clause in 
Tab. 1 ( byla bych se j l  zd6astnila (I would have 
220 
participaied in iV):

zfi~astnit/k5eApFnStMmPaP 
3.2 Generalisation 
The lemmata nd the tags are now being gener- 
alised. Three generalisation perations are em- 
ployed: elimination of (some of) lemmata, gen- 
eralisation of grammatical categories and find- 
ing grammatical greement constraints. 
3.2.1 E l iminat ion of lemmata 
All lemmata except forms of auxiliary verb bit 
(to be) (b~t, by, aby, kdyby) are rejected. Lem- 
mata of modal verbs and verbs with similar be- 
haviour are replaced by tag modal. These verbs 
have been found in the list of more than 15 000 
verb valencies (Pala and Seve?ek P., 1999). In 
our example it is the verb zdSastnit hat is re- 
moved.

3.2.2 Generalisation of grammatical 
categories 
Exploiting linguistic knowledge, several gram- 
matical categories are not important for verb 
group description. Very often it is negation (e), 
or aspect (a - aI stands for imperfectum, aP 
for perfectum). These categories may be re- 
moved. For some of verbs even person (p) can 
be removed. In our example the values of those 
grammatical categories have been replaced by ? 
and we obtained 
b~t/k5e?pFnStMmPa? 
by/k5e?p?nStPmCa? 
k3xXnSc? 
gap 
k5e?pFnStMmPa? 
3.2.3 Finding grammatical agreement 
constraints 
Another situation appears when two or more 
values of some category are related. In the sim- 
plest case they have to be the same - e.g. the 
value of attribute person (p) in the first and the 
last word of our example. More complicated is 
the relation among the values of attribute num- 
ber (n). They should be the same except when 
the polite way of addressing occurs, e.g. in byl 
byste se j i  zdSastnil (you would have partici- 
pated in it). Thus we have to check whether the 
values are the same or the conditions of polite 
way of addressing are satisfied. For this purpose 
we add the predicate check_.num() that ensures 
agreement in the grammatical category number 
and we obtain 
b~t/k5e?p_n_tMmPa? 
by/k5e?p?n_tPmCa? 
k3xXnSc? 
gap 
k5e?p_n_tMmPa? 
check_hum(n) 
3.3 DCG Rules Synthesis 
Finally the verb rule is constructed by rewriting 
the result of the generalisation phase. For the 
sentence byla bych se j l  zd6astnila (I would have 
participated in it) we obtain 
verb_group (vg (Be, Cond, Se, Verb), 
Gaps) --> 
be (Be ,_, P, N, tM.,mP,_), 
7, b~t/k5e?p_n_tMmPa? 
cond (Cond, .... Ncond, tP, mC, _), 
7, by/k5e?p?n_tPmCa? 
{che ck_num (N, Ncond, Cond, Vy) }, 
ref lex_pron (Se, xX, _, _), 
7, k3xXnSc? 
gap( \[\] ,Gaps), 
7. gap 
k5 (Verb . . . . .  P,N,tM,mP,_). 
7. k5e?p_n_tMmPa? 
If this rule does not exist in the set of verb 
rules yet~ it is added into it. The meanings 
of non-terminals used in the rule are following: 
221 
be() represents auxiliary verb b~t, cond() rep- 
resents various forms of conditionals by, aby, 
kdyby, ref lex_pron()  stands for reflexive pro- 
noun se (si), gap() is a special predicate for 
manipulation with gaps, and k5 () stands for ar- 
bitrary non-auxiliary verb. The particular val- 
ues of some arguments of non-terminals repre- 
sent required properties. Simple cases of gram- 
matical agreement are treated through binding 
of variables. More complicated situations are 
solved employing constraints like the predicate 
check_hum(). 
The method has been implemented in Perl. 126 
definite clause grammar rules were constructed 
from the annotated corpus that describe all verb 
groups that are frequent in Czech. 
4 Recogn i t ion  o f  Verb  Groups  
The verb rules have been used for recognition, 
and consequently for tagging, of verb groups in 
unannotated text. A portion of sentences which 
have not been used for learning, has been ex- 
tracted from a corpus. Each sentence has been 
ambiguously tagged with LEMMA morphologi- 
cal analyser (Pala and Seve~ek, 1995), i.e. each 
word of the sentence has been assigned to all 
possible tags. Then all the verb rules were ap- 
plied to each sentence. The learned verb rules 
displayed quite good accuracy. For corpus DE- 
SAM, a verb rule has been correctly assigned to 
92.3% verb groups. We tested, too, how much 
is this method dependent on the corpus that 
was used for learning. As the source of testing 
data we used Prague Tree Bank (PTB) Corpus 
that is under construction at Charles Univer- 
sity in Prague. The accuracy displayed was not 
different from results for DESAM. It maybe x- 
plained by the fact that both corpora have been 
built from newspaper articles. 
Although the accuracy is acceptable for the test 
data that include also clauses with just one 
verb, errors have been observed for complex sen- 
tences. In about 13% of them, some of com- 
pound verb groups were not correctly recog- 
nized. It was observed that almost 7{)% of these 
errors were caused by incorrect lemrna recogni- 
tion. In the next section we describe a method 
for fixing this kind of errors. 
5 Fixing Misclassification Errors  
We combined two approaches, elimination of 
lemmata which are very rare for a given 
word form, and inductive logic program- 
ming (Popelinsk~ et al, 1999; Pavelek and 
Popelinsk~, 1999). The method is used in the 
post-processing phase to prune the set of rules 
that have fired for the sentence. 
5.1 E l iminat ion of in f requent  lemmata  
In Czech corpora it was observed that 10% of 
word positions - i.e. each 10th word of a text 
- have at least 2 lemmata nd about 1% word 
forms of Czech vocabulary has at least 2 lem- 
mata. (Popelinsk~ et al, 1999; Pavelek and 
Popelinsk~, 1999) E.g. word form psi can be

+ infrequent lemmata 91.1 94.8

Table 3: PTB: Results for unannotated text 
either preposition at (like at the lesson) or im- 
perative of argue. We decided to remove all the 
verb rules that recognised a word-lemma couple 
of a very small frequency in the corpus. Actu- 
ally those lemmata that did not appear more 
than twice in DESAM corpus were supposed to 
be incorrect. 
For testing, we randomly chose the set of 600 
examples including compound or complex sen- 
tences from corpus DESAM. 251 sentences con- 
tained only one verb. The results obtained are 
in Tab. 2. The first line contains the number 
of examples used. In the following line there 
are results of the original method as mentioned 
in Section 4. Next line (+ infrequent lemmata) 
222 
displays results when the word-lemma couple of 
a very small frequency have been removed. The 
column '> 1 verb' concerns the sentences where 
at least two verbs appeared. The column 'all' 
displays accuracy for all sentences. Results for 
corpus PTB are displayed in Tab. 3. It can be 
observed that after pruning rules that contain a 
rare lemma the accuracy significantly increased. 
5.2 Lemma disambiguat ion by ILP 
Some of incorrectly recognised lemmata cannot 
be fixed by the method described. E.g. word 
form se has two lemmata, se - reflexive pronoun 
and s - preposition with and both word-lemma 
couples are very frequent in Czech. For such 
cases we exploited inductive logic programming 
(ILP). The program reads the context of the 
lemma-ambiguous word and results in disam- 
biguation rules (PopeHnsk~ et al, 1999; Pavelek 
and Popelinsk~, 1999). We employed ILP sys- 
tem Aleph 1. 
Domain knowledge predicates (Popelinsk~ et 
al., 1999; Pavelek and Popelinsk~, 1999) have 
the form p(Context, first(N),Condition) 
or p(Context, somewhere,Condition), where 
Context contains tags of either left or right 
context (for the left context in the re- 
verse order), first(N) defines a subset of 
Context, somewhere does not narrow the con- 
text. The term Condition can have three 
forms, somewhere(List) (the values in List 
appeared somewhere in the define subset of 
Context), always(List) (the values appeared 
in all tags in the given subset of Context) and 
n_times (N ,Tag) (Tag may appear n-times in the 
specified context). E.g. p(Left, first(2), 
always ( \[k5, eA\] ) ) succeeds if in the first two 
tags of the left context there always appears 
k5, eA. 
In the last line of Tab. 2 and 3 there is the per- 
centage of correct rules when also the lemma 
disambiguation has been employed. The in- 
crease of accuracy was much smaller than after 
pruning rules that contain a rare lemma. It has 
to be mentioned that in the case of PTB about a 
half of errors (incorrectly recognised verb rules) 
were caused by incorrect recognition of sentence 
boundaries.

machleaxn/Aleph/aleph.html 
6 Tagg ing  Verb  Groups  
We now describe a method for compound verb 
group tagging in morphologically annotated 
corpora. We decided to use SGML-like notation 
for tagging because it allows to incorporate 
the new tags very easily into DESAM corpus. 
The beginning and the end of the whole verb 
group and beginnings and ends of its particular 
components are marked. For the sentence byla 
bych se j l  zd6astnila (I would have participated 
in it) we receive 
<vg tag=" eApFnSt PmCaPr iv0" 
fmverb=" zfi~ astnit "> 
<vgp>byla</vgp> 
<vgp>bych</vgp> 
<vgp>se</vgp> 
jx 
<vgp>zfi~astnila</vgp> </vg> 
where <vg> </vg> point out the beginning 
and the end of the verb group, <vgp> </vgp> 
mark components (parts) of the verb group. 
The assigned tag - i.e. values of significant 
morphologic ategories - of the whole group is 
included as a value of attribute called tag in 
the starting mark of the group. Value of the 
attribute fmverb is the full-meaning verb; this 
information can be exploited e.g. for searching 
and processing of verb valencies afterwards. 
The value of attribute tag is computed auto- 
matically from the verb rule that describes the 
compound verb group. 
We are also able to detect other properties of 
compound verb groups. In the example above 
the new category r is introduced. It indicates 
that the group is reflexive (rl) or not (r0). 
The category v enables to mark whether the 
group is in the form of polite way of addressing 
(vl) or not (v0). The differences of the tag 
values can be observed comparing the previous 
and the following examples (nebyl byste se j l  
zd6astnil (you would not have participated in 
it)) 
<vg tag="eNpMnStPmCaPrlvl" 
fmverb=" zfi~ astnit" > 
<vgp>nebyl</vgp> 
<vgp>byste</vgp> 
<vgp>se</vgp> 
<vgp>zfi~astnil</vgp> </vg> 
223 
The set of attributes can be also enriched e.g. 
with the number of components. We also plan 
to include into the attributes of <vg> com- 
pound verb group type. It will enable to find 
the groups of the same type but wit:h different 
word order or the number of components. 
7 D iscuss ion  
Sometimes compound verb groups are defined in 
a less general way. Another approach that deal 
with the recognition and morphological tagging 
of compound verb groups in Czech appeared in 
(Osolsob~, 1999). Basic compound verb groups 
in Czech like active present, passive past tense, 
present conditional etc., are defined in terms 
of grammatical categories used in DESAM cor- 
pus. Two drawbacks of this approach can be 
observed. First, verb groups may only be com- 
pound of a reflexive pronoun, verbs to be and 
not more than one full-meaning verb,. Second, 
the gap between two words of the particular 
group cannot be longer than three words. The 
verb rules defined here are less general then the 
basic verb groups (Osolsob~, 1999). Actually 
verb rules make partition of them. Thus we can 
tag all these basic verb groups withont the lim- 
itations mentioned above. In contrast o some 
other approaches we include into the groups also 
some verbs which are in fact infinitive partici- 
pants of verb valencies. However, we are able to 
detect such cases and recognize the "pure" verb 
groups afterwards. We believe that for some 
kind of shallow semantic analysis - e.g. in di- 
alogue systems - our approach is more conve~ 
nient. 
We are also able to recognize the form of po- 
lite way of addressing a person (which has not 
equivalent in English, but similar phenomenon 
appears e.g. in French or German). We extend 
the tag of a verb group with this inibrmation. 
because it is quite important for understanding 
the sentence. E.g. in gel jste (vous ~tes allg) the 
word jste (~tes) should be counted as singular 
although it is always tagged as plural. 
8 Ongo ing  Research  
Our work is a part of the project which aims 
at building a partial parser for Czech. Main 
idea of partial parsing (Abney, 1991) is to rec- 
ognize those parts of sentences which can be re- 
covered reliably and with a small amount of syn- 
tactic information. In this paper we deal with 
recognition and tagging potentially discontinu- 
ous verb chunks. The problem of recognition of 
noun chunks in Czech was addressed in (Smr2 
and Z?~kov?, 1998). We aim at an advanced 
method that should employ a minimum of ad 
hoc techniques and should be, ideally, fully au- 
tomatic. The first step in this direction, the 
method for pruning verb rules, has been de- 
scribed in this paper. In the future we want 
to make the method even more adaptive. Some 
preliminary results on finding sentence bound- 
ary are displayed below. 
In Czech it is either comma and/or a conjunc- 
tion that make the boundary between two sen- 
tences. From the corpus we have randomly cho- 
sen 406 pieces of text that contain a comma. 
In 294 cases the comma split two sentences. All 
"easy" cases (when comma is followed by a con- 
junction, it must be a boundary) were removed. 
It was 155 out of 294 cases. 80% of the rest of 
examples was used for learning. We used again 
Aleph for learning. For the test set the learned 
rules correctly recognised comma as a delimiter 
of two sentences in 86.3% of cases. When the 
"easy" cases were added the accuracy increased 
to 90.8%. 
Then we tried to employ this method for auto- 
matic finding of boundaries in our system for 
verb group recognition. Decrease of accuracy 
was expected but it was quite small. In spite of 
some extra boundary was found (the particular 
comma did not split two sentences), the correct 
verb groups have been found in most of such 
cases. The reason is that such incorrectly de- 
tected boundary splits a compound verb group 
very rarely. 
The last experiment concerned the case when 
a conjunction splits two sentences and the con- 
junction is not preceded with comma. There 
are four such conjunctions in Czech - a (and), 
nebo (or), i (even) and ani (neither, nor). Us- 
ing Aleph we obtained the accuracy on test data 
88.3% for a (500 examples, 90% used/ for  learn- 
ing) and 87.2% for nebo (110 examples). The 
last two conjunctions split sentences very rarely. 
Actually, in the current version of corpus DE- 
SAM it has never happened.

9 Re levant  works  
Another approach for recognition of compound 
verb groups in Czech (Osolsob~, 1999) have 
been already discussed in Section 7. Ramshaw 
and Marcus (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) views 
chunking as a tagging problem. They used 
transformation-based learning and achieved re- 
call and precision rates 93% for base noun 
phrase (non-recursive noun phrase) and 88% for 
chunks that partition the sentence. Verb chunk- 
ing for English was solved by Veenstra (Veen- 
stra, 1999). He used memory-based learner 
Timbl for noun phrase, verb phrase and propo- 
sitional phrase chunking.Each word in a sen- 
tence was first assigned one of tags I_T (inside 
the phrase), O_T (outside the phrase) and B_T 
(left-most word in the phrase that is preceded 
by another phrase of the same kind), where T 
stands for the kind of a phrase. 
Chunking in Czech language is more difficult 
than in English for two reasons. First, a gap 
inside a verb group may be more complex and 
it may be even a whole sentence. Second, Czech 
language is a free word-order language what im- 
plies that the process of recognition of the verb 
group structure is much more difficult. 
10 Conc lus ion  
We described the method for automatic recog- 
nition of compound verb groups in Czech sen- 
tences. Recognition of compound verb groups 
was tested on unannotated text randomly cho- 
sen from two different corpora and the accu- 
racy reached 95% of correctly recognised verb 
groups. We also introduced the method for au- 
tomatic tagging of compound verb groups.
