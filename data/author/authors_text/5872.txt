Abstract 
This paper presents the task definition, re-
sources, and the single participant system 
for Task 12: Turkish Lexical Sample Task 
(TLST), which was organized in the Se-
mEval-2007 evaluation exercise. The 
methodology followed for developing the 
specific linguistic resources necessary for 
the task has been described in this context. 
A language-specific feature set was defined 
for Turkish. TLST consists of three pieces 
of data: The dictionary, the training data, 
and the evaluation data. Finally, a single 
system that utilizes a simple statistical 
method was submitted for the task and 
evaluated. 
1 Introduction 
Effective parameters for word sense disambigua-
tion (WSD) may vary for different languages and 
word types. Although, some parameters are com-
mon in many languages, some others may be lan-
guage specific. Turkish is an interesting language 
that deserves being examined semantically. Turk-
ish is based upon suffixation, which differentiates 
it sharply from the majority of European languages, 
and many others. Like all Turkic languages, Turk-
ish is agglutinative, that is, grammatical functions 
are indicated by adding various suffixes to stems. 
Turkish has a SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) sentence 
structure but other orders are possible under certain 
discourse situations. As a SOV language where 
objects precede the verb, Turkish has postpositions 
rather than prepositions, and relative clauses that 
precede the verb. Turkish, as a widely-spoken lan-
guage, is appropriate for semantic researches. 
TLST utilizes some resources that are explained 
in Section 2-5. In Section 6 evaluation of the sys-
tem is provided. In section 7 some concluding re-
marks and future work are discussed.  
2 Corpus 
Lesser studied languages, such as Turkish suffer 
from the lack of wide coverage electronic re-
sources or other language processing tools like on-
tologies, dictionaries, morphological analyzers, 
parsers etc. There are some projects for providing 
data for NLP applications in Turkish like METU 
Corpus Project (Oflazer et al, 2003). It has two 
parts, the main corpus and the treebank that con-
sists of parsed, morphologically analyzed and dis-
ambiguated sentences selected from the main cor-
pus, respectively. The sentences are given in XML 
format and provide many syntactic features that 
can be helpful for WSD. This corpus and treebank 
can be used for academic purposes by contract. 
The texts in main corpus have been taken from 
different types of Turkish written texts published 
in 1990 and afterwards. It has about two million 
words. It includes 999 written texts taken from 201 
books, 87 papers and news from 3 different Turk-
ish daily newspapers. XML and Text Encoding 
Initiative (TEI) style annotation have been used. 
The distribution of the texts in the Treebank is 
similar to the main corpus. There are 6930 sen-
tences in this Treebank. These sentences have been 
parsed, morphologically analyzed and disambigu-
ated. In Turkish, a word can have more than one 
analysis, so having disambiguated texts is very 
important.

Frequencies of the words have been found as it 
is necessary to select appropriate ambiguous words 
for WSD. There are 5356 different root words and 
627 of these words have 15 or more occurrences, 
and the rest have less. 
The XML files contains tagging information in 
the word (morphological analysis) and sentence 
level as a parse tree as shown in Figure 1. In the 
word level, inflectional forms are provided. And in 
the sentence level relations among words are 
given. The S tag is for sentence and W tag is for 
the word. IX is used for index of the word in the 
sentence, LEM is left as blank and lemma is given 
in the MORPH tag as a part of it with the morpho-
logical analysis of the word. REL is for parsing 
information. It consists of three parts, two numbers 
and a relation. For example REL="[2, 1, (MODI-
FIER)]" means this word is modifying the first in-
flectional group of the second word in the sen-
tence. The structure of the treebank data was de-
signed by METU. Initially lemmas were decided to 
be provided as a tag by itself, however, lemmas are 
left as blank. This does not mean that lemmas are 
not available in the treebank; the lemmas are given 
as a part of ?IG? tag. Programs are available for 
extracting this information for the time being. All 
participants can get these programs and thereby the 
lemmas easily and instantly. 
The sense tags were not included in the treebank 
and had to be added manually. Sense tagging has 
been checked in order to obtain gold standard data. 
Initial tagging process has been finished by a sin-
gle tagger and controlled. Two other native speaker 
in the team tagged and controlled the examples. 
That is, this step was completed by three taggers. 
Problematic cases were handled by a commission 
and the decision was finalized when about 90% 
agreement has been reached. 
3 Dictionary 
The dictionary is the one that is published by 
TDK 1  (Turkish Language Foundation) and it is 
open to public via internet. This dictionary lists the 
senses along with their definitions and example 
sentences that are provided for some senses. The 
dictionary is used only for sense tagging and 
enumeration of the senses for standardization. No 
specific information other than the sense numbers

 http://tdk.org.tr/tdksozluk/sozara.htm 
is taken from the dictionary; therefore there is no 
need for linguistic processing of the dictionary. 
4 Training and Evaluation Data 
In Table 1 statistical information about the final 
training and testing sets of TLST is summarized. 
The data have been provided for 3 words in the 
trial set and 26 words in the final training and test-
ing sets (10 nouns, 10 verbs and 6 other POS for 
the rest of POS including adjectives and adverbs). 
It has been tagged about 100 examples per word, 
but the number of samples is incremented or dec-
remented depending on the number of senses that 
specific word has. For a few words, however, 
fewer examples exist due to the sparse distribution 
of the data. Some ambiguous words had fewer ex-
amples in the corpus, therefore they were either 
eliminated or some other examples drawn from 
external resources were added in the same format. 
On the average, the selected words have 6.7 
senses, verbs, however, have more. Approximately 
70% of the examples for each word were delivered 
as training data, whereas approximately 30% was 
reserved as evaluation data. The distribution of the 
senses in training and evaluation data has been 
kept proportional. The sets are given as plain text 
files for each word under each POS. The samples 
for the words that can belong to more than one 
POS are listed under the majority class. POS is 
provided for each sample. 
We have extracted example sentences of the tar-
get word(s) and some features from the XML files. 
Then tab delimited text files including structural 
and sense tag information are obtained. In these  
files each line has contextual information that are 
thought to be effective (Orhan and Altan, 2006; 
Orhan and Altan, 2005) in Turkish WSD about the 
target words. In the upper level for each of them 
XML file id, sentence number and the order of the 
ambiguous word are kept as a unique key for that 
specific target. In the sentence level, three catego-
ries of information, namely the features related to 
the previous words, target word itself and the sub-
sequent words in the context are provided.

Table 2: Features and example 
In the treebank relational structure, there can be 
more than one word in the previous context related 
to the target, however there is only a single word in 
the subsequent one. Therefore the data for all 
words in the  previous context is provided sepa-
rately. The features that are employed for previous 
and the subsequent words are the same and they 
are the root word, POS(corrected), tags for ontol-
ogy level 1, level 2 and level 3, POS, inflected 
POS, case marker, possessor and relation. How-
ever for the target word only the root word, POS, 
inflected POS, case marker, possessor and relation 
are taken into consideration. Fine and coarse-
grained (FG and CG respectively) sense numbers 
and the sentence that has the ambiguous word have 
been added as the last three feature. FG senses are 
the ones that are decided to be the exact senses. 
CG senses are given as a set that are thought to be 
possible alternatives in addition to the FG sense. 
Table 2 demonstrates the whole list of features 
provided in a single line of data files along with an 
example. The ??? in the features shows the missing 
values. This is actually corresponding to the fea-
tures that do not exist or can not be obtained from 
the treebank due to some problematic cases. The 
62
line that corresponds to this entry will be the fol-
lowing line (as tab delimited):

de?il mi ?iyi olmamdan ; onu taparcas?na 
sevmemden s?k?ld? .# 
5 Ontology 
A small scale ontology for the target words and 
their context was constructed. The Turkish Word-
Net developed at Sabanc? University2 is somehow 
insufficient. Only the verbs have some levels of 
relations similar to English WordNet. The nouns, 
adjectives, adverbs and other words that are fre-
quently used in Turkish and in the context of the 
ambiguous words were not included. This is not a 
suitable resource for fulfilling the requirements of 
TLST and an ontology specific to this task was 
required. The ontology covers the examples that 
are selected and has three levels of relations that 
are supposed to be effective in the disambiguation 
process. We tried to be consistent with the Word-
Net tags; additionally we constructed the ontology 
not only for nouns and verbs but for all the words 
that are in the context of the ambiguous words se-
lected. Additionally we tried to strengthen the rela-
tion among the context words by using the same 
tags for all POS in the ontology. This is somehow 
deviating from WordNet methodology, since each 
word category has its own set of classification in it. 
6 Evaluation 
WSD is a new area of research in Turkish. The 
sense tagged data provided in TLST are the first 
resources for this specific domain in Turkish. Due 
to the limited and brand new resources available 
and the time restrictions the participation was less. 
We submitted a very simple system that utilizes 
statistical information. It is similar to the Na?ve 
Bayes approach. The features in the training data 
was used individually and the probababilities of 
the senses are calculated. Then in the test phase the 
probabilities of each sense is calculated with the 
given features and the three highest-scored senses 
are selected as the answer. The average precision 
and recall values for each word category are given

in Table 3. The values are not so high, as it can be 
expected. The size of the training data is limited, 
but the size is the highest possible under these cir-
cumstances, but it should be incremented in the 
near future. The number of senses is high and pro-
viding enough instances is difficult.  The data and 
the methodology for WSD will be improved by the 
experience obtained in SemEval evaluation exer-
cise. 
The evaluation is done only for FG and CG 
senses. For FG senses no partial points are as-
signed and 1 point is assigned for a correct match. 
On the other hand, the CG senses are evaluated 
partially. If the answer tags are matching with any 
of the answer tags they are given points.

7 Conclusion 
In TLST we have prepared the first resources for 
WSD researches in Turkish. Therefore it has sig-
nificance in Turkish WSD studies. Although the 
resources and methodology have some deficien-
cies, a valuable effort was invested during the de-
velopment of them. The resources and the method-
ology for Turkish WSD will be improved by the 
experience obtained in SemEval and will be open 
to public in the very near future from
