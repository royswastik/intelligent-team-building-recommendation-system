Abstract
We have developed a discourse level
tagging tool for spoken dialogue cor-
pus using machine learning meth-
ods. As discourse level informa-
tion, we focused on dialogue act, rel-
evance and discourse segment. In
dialogue act tagging, we have im-
plemented a transformation-based
learning procedure and resulted in
70% accuracy in open test. In
relevance and discourse segment
tagging, we have implemented a
decision-tree based learning proce-
dure and resulted in about 75% and
72% accuracy respectively.
1 Introduction
In dialogue research communities, the need of
dialogue corpora with various level of anno-
tation is recognized. However, creating an-
notated dialogue corpora needs considerable
cost in recording, transcribing, annotating,
and checking the consistency and reliability
of the annotated data.
Considering such situation, we focused on
annotation step and developed discourse level
tagging tool for spoken dialogue corpus using
machine learning methods. In this paper, we
explain the detail of tagging scheme and de-
scribe machine learning algorithm suitable for
each level of tagging.
2 Multiple level tagging scheme
for Japanese dialogue
It is widely recognized that making annotated
spoken dialogue corpora is labor-intensive ef-
fort. To this end, the Discourse Research
Initiative (DRI) was set up in March of
1996 by US, European, and Japanese re-
searchers to develop standard discourse anno-
tation schemes (Carletta et al, 1997; Core et
al., 1998). In line with the effort of this initia-
tive, Japanese Discourse Research Initiative
has started and created annotation scheme for
various level of information of dialogue, that
is JDTAG (Japanese Dialogue TAG) (JDRI,
2000). Our aim is to develop tagging tools in
line with the JDTAG.
In the following of this section, we explain
the part of tagging scheme which are relevant
to our tools.
2.1 Dialogue act
In JDTAG, slash unit is defined following
Meteer and Taylor (Meteer and Taylor, 1995).
Dialogue act tagging scheme is a set of rules to
identify the function of each slash unit from
the viewpoint of speech act theory (Searle,
1969) and discourse analysis (Coulthhard,
1992; Stenstrom, 1994). These dialogue act
tag reflect a local structure of the dialogue.
To improve the agreement score among the
annotators, we assume basic structure of dia-
logue shown in Figure 1.
Typical exchange pattern is shown in Fig-
ure 2.
In this scheme, the tags (Figure 3) need to
be an element of exchange structure except
for those of dialogue management.
2.2 Relevance
Dialogue act tag can be regarded as a function
of utterance. Therefore, we can see the se-
quence of dialogue act tag as the flat structure
of the dialogue. It is insufficient to express
? Task-orientedDialogue ? (Opening) ProblemSolving (Closing)

The element of this category is represented as
Response Type / Initiate Type.
Figure 3: Tag set of dialogue act
tree-like structure, such as embedded subdia-
logue. In order to represent such higher level
information, we use a relevance tag.
There are two types of relevance between
slash units. The one is the relevance of the
inside of exchange. The other is the relevance
of between neighboring exchanges. We call
the former one as relevance type 1, and the
latter one as relevance type 2.
Relevance type 1 represents the relation of
initiate utterance and its response utterance
by showing the ID number of the initiate ut-
terance at the response utterance. By us-
ing this tag, the initiate-response pair which
strides over embedded subdialogue can be
grasped.
Relevance type 2 represents the meso-
structure of the dialogue such as chaining,
coupling, elliptical coupling as introduced in
(Stenstrom, 1994). Chaining is a pattern of
[A:I B:R] [A:I B:R] (speaker A initiates the
exchange and speaker B responds it). Cou-
pling is a pattern of [A:I B:R] [B:I A:R].
Elliptical coupling is a pattern of [A:I] [B:I
A:R] which omits the response in the first ex-
change. Relevance type 2 tag is attached to
the each initiate response in showing whether
such meso-level dialogue structure can be ob-
served (yes) or not (no).
The follow-up utterance has no relevance
tag. It is because follow-up necessarily has a
relevance to the preceded response utterance.
The example of dialogue act tagging (first
element of tag) and relevance tagging (second
element) is shown Figure 4.

[TBI:topic name:segment relation]
Figure 5: An example dialogue with the dia-
logue segment tags
2.3 Dialogue segment
Dialogue segment of JDTAG indicates bound-
ary of discourse segment introduced in (Grosz
and Sidner, 1986). A dialogue segment is
identified based on the exchange structure ex-
plained above. A dialogue segment tag is first
inserted before each initiating utterance. Af-
ter that, a topic break index, a topic name,
and a segment relation are identified.
Topic break index (TBI) takes the value of
1 or 2: the boundary with TBI=2 is less con-
tinuous than the one with TBI=1 with regard
to the topic. The topic name is labeled by an-
notators? subjective judgment for the topics
of that segment. The segment relation indi-
cates the one between the preceding and the
following segments, which is classified as clar-
ification, interruption, and return.
Figure 5 shows an example dialogue with
the dialogue segment tags.
3 Dialogue act tagger
Considering the limitation of amount of cor-
pus with dialogue level annotations, a promis-
ing dialogue act tagger is based on ma-
chine learning method with limited amount of
training data rather than statistical method,
which needs large amount of training data.
Rule-based and example-based learning algo-
rithms are suitable to this purpose. In this
section, we compare our implementation of
transformation-based rule learning algorithm
and example-based tagging algorithm.
3.1 Transformation-based learning
Transformation-based learning is a simple
rule-based learning algorithm. Figure 6 illus-
trates the learning process.

Figure 6: Learning procedure of dialogue act
tagging rule by TBL
First, initial tagged data was made from
unannotated corpus by using bootstrapping
method. In our implementation, we use de-
fault rule which assigns the most frequent
tag to all the utterance as a bootstrapping
method. All the possible rules are constructed
from annotated corpus by combining condi-
tional parts and their consequence. All the
possible rule are applied to the data and
the rule whose transformation results in the
greatest improvement is selected. This rule is
added to the current rule set and this itera-
tion is continued until no improvement is ob-
served. In the previous research, TBL showed
successful performance in many annotation
task, e.g. (Brill, 1995), (Samuel et al, 1998).
In our experiment, the selected features in
the conditional part of the rule are words
(the notation in the rule is include), sentence
length (length) and previous dialogue act tag
(prev). Although each feature is not enough
to use as a clue in determining dialogue act,
the combination of these features works well.
We used four types of combinations, that is,
include + include, include + length, include
+ prev and length + prev.
The result of the learning process is a se-
quence of rules. For example, in dialogue act
tagging, acquired rules in scheduling domain
are shown in Figure 7.
#1 condition: default,
new_tag: wh-question
#2 condition: include="yoroshii(good)"
& include="ka(*1)",
new_tag: yes-no-question
#3 condition: include="hai(yes)"
& prev=yes-no-question,
new_tag: affirmative
#4 condition: include="understand"
& length < 4,
new_tag: follow-up
...
(*1 "ka" is a functional word
for interrogative sentence)

3.2 Example-based learning
Example-based learning is suitable for classi-
fication task. It stores up example of input
and corresponding class, calculates the dis-
tance between these examples and new input,
and classifies it to the nearest class.
In our dialogue act tagging, the example
is consists of word sequence (partitioned by
slash unit tag) and part of speech information.
Corresponding dialogue act tag is attached to
all the example.
The distance between example and new in-
put is calculated using the weighted agree-
ment of elements shown in Table 1.

dialogue act of previous sentence 3

3.3 Experimental results
We have compared above two dialogue act
tagging algorithms in two different tasks: a
route direction task and a car trouble shoot-
ing task. We used 4 dialogues for each task
(268 and 184 sentences) as a training data
and 2 dialogues as a test data (113 and 63
sentences). The results are shown in Table 2.
Table 2: Comparison of TBL and example-
based method.
algorithm task closed open
route direction 85.1 72.6
TBL car trouble shooting 90.2 66.7
average 87.7 69.7
route direction 93.8 62.6
ex-based car trouble shooting 89.7 52.4
average 91.8 57.5
We got similar average score for closed test.
Therefore, we regard the tuning level of pa-
rameter of each algorithm as a comparable
level. In open test in the same task, we got
69.7% in TBL and 57.5 % in example-based
method. As a result, we can conclude TBL is
more suitable method for dialogue act tagging
learning in limited amount of training data.
4 Relevance tagger using decision
tree
4.1 Decision tree learning
Decision tree learning algorithm is one of clas-
sification rule learning algorithm. The train-
ing data is a list of attribute-value pair. The
output of this algorithm is a decision tree
whose nodes are regarded as set of rules. Each
rule tests the value of an attribute and indi-
cates the next node.
A basic algorithm is as follows:
1. create root node.
2. if all the data belong to the same class,
create a class node and exit.
otherwise,
? choose one attribute which has
the maximum mutual informa-
tion and create nodes correspond-
ing values.
? divide and assign the training
data according to the values and
create link to the new node.
3. apply this algorithm to all the new nodes recur-
sively
We also used post-pruning rule hired in
C4.5 (Quinlan, 1992).
4.2 Relevance tagging algorithm and
results
Relevance type 1
Relevance type 1 tag is automatically an-
notated according to the exchange structure
which is identified in dialogue act tagging
stage. The accuracy of the relevance type
1 tag is depend on whether a given dialogue
or task domain is follow the assumption of
exchange structure explained above. In well
formed dialogue, the accuracy is above 95%.
However, in ill-formed case, it is around 70%.
Relevance type 2
We have used decision tree method in
identifying relevance type 2, which identi-
fies whether neighboring exchange structures
have a certain kind of relevance. The at-
tributes of training data are as follows.
1. relevance type 2 tag of previous exchange
2. initiative dialogue act tag of previous exchange
3. response dialogue act tag of previous exchange
4. initiative dialogue act tag of current exchange
We used 9 dialogue (hotel reservation, route
direction, scheduling, and telephone shop-
ping) as training and test data. The results
are shown in Table 3. We got this results after
10 cross validation. In cross domain experi-
ment, we got 84% accuracy in closed test (av-
erage 47 nodes) and 75% in open test. Using
post-pruning method, we got 82% of accuracy
(average 22 nodes; estimated accuracy 76%)
in closed test and 77% in open test.
5 Dialogue segment tagger
5.1 TBI tagger
We used decision tree method in identifying
the value of topic break index because the tar-
get attribute have only two values; 1 (small
topic change) or 2 (large topic change). In
case of target attribute has small number of
values, decision tree method can be estimated
to outperform transformation-based learning.
The attributes of training data are as fol-
lows.
1. relevance type 2 tag of previous exchange
2. relevance type 2 tag of current exchange
3. topic break index tag of previous exchange
4. dialogue act tag of previous slash unit
5. dialogue act tag of current slash unit
We used same data set with the experiment
of dialogue act tagging. We got 87% accuracy
in closed test (average 61 nodes) and 80% in
open test. Using post-pruning method, we got
82% of accuracy (average 12 nodes; estimated
accuracy 76%) in closed test and 78% in open
test (see Table 4).
5.2 Topic name tagger
In JDTAG topic name tagging scheme, anno-
tators can assign a topic name subjectively
to the given dialogue segment. Certainly it
is an appropriate method for this scheme to
use for the dialogue of any task domain. But,
even in the almost same pattern of exchange,
different annotators might annotate different
topic names. It prevent the data from a prac-
tical usage, e.g. extracting exchange pattern
in asking a route to certain place.
We prepare a candidate topic name list and
assign to dialogue segment as a topic name.
Because candidate topic name is around 10
to 30 according to the task domain, we use
transformation-based learning method for ac-
quiring a topic name tagging rule set.
The selected features in the conditional
part of the rule are words of current segment
(up to 2), dialogue act tag of the first slash
unit of the segment, topic name tag of previ-
ous segment.
As a result, in the above data set, the candi-
date rules are 5588. And we got 98% accuracy
in the closed test and 56% in open test.
5.3 Segment relation tagger
The number of segment relation types are 4
(clarification, interruption, return, and none).
Therefore, we used decision tree for acquiring
rules for identifying segment relation types.
In making decision tree, we did not use
post-pruning because a great many of seg-
ment relation tag is none (about 85%). Post-
pruning makes a tree too general (only one
top node which identifies none or else).

As a result, also in the same data set, we
got 92% accuracy in the closed test.
6 Conclusion
We have developed a discourse level tagging
tool for spoken dialogue corpus using machine
learning methods. We use transformation-
based learning method in case of many target
values, and decision tree method otherwise.
Our future work is to develop an environ-
ment in which annotators can easily browse
and post-edit the output of the tool.
