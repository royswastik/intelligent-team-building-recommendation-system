Abstract
Most approaches to event extraction focus
on mentions anchored in verbs. However,
many mentions of events surface as noun
phrases. Detecting them can increase the
recall of event extraction and provide the
foundation for detecting relations between
events. This paper describes a weakly-
supervised method for detecting nominal
event mentions that combines techniques
from word sense disambiguation (WSD)
and lexical acquisition to create a classifier
that labels noun phrases as denoting events
or non-events. The classifier uses boot-
strapped probabilistic generative models
of the contexts of events and non-events.
The contexts are the lexically-anchored se-
mantic dependency relations that the NPs
appear in. Our method dramatically im-
proves with bootstrapping, and comfort-
ably outperforms lexical lookup methods
which are based on very much larger hand-
crafted resources.
1 Introduction
The goal of information extraction is to generate
a set of abstract information objects that repre-
sent the entities, events, and relations of particu-
lar types mentioned in unstructured text. For ex-
ample, in a judicial domain, relevant event types
might be ARREST, CHARGING, TRIAL, etc.
Although event extraction techniques usually
focus on extracting mentions textually anchored
by verb phrases or clauses, e.g. (Aone and Ramos-
? This work was supported in part by SBIR grant
FA8750-05-C-0187 from the Air Force Research Laboratory
(AFRL)/IFED.
Santacruz, 2000), many event mentions, espe-
cially subsequent mentions of events that are the
primary topic of a document, are referred to with
nominals. Because of this, detecting nominal
event mentions, like those in (1), can increase the
recall of event extraction systems, in particular for
the most important events in a document.1
(1) The slain journalist was a main organizer of the mas-
sive demonstrations that forced Syria to withdraw its
troops from Lebanon last April, after Assad was widely
accused of planningHariri?s assassination in a Febru-
ary car bombing that was similar to today?s blast.
Detecting event nominals is also an important
step in detecting relations between event men-
tions, as in the causal relation between the demon-
strations and the withdrawal and the similarity re-
lation between the bombing and the blast in (1).
Finally, detecting nominal events can improve
detection and coreference of non-named mentions
of non-event entities (e.g. persons, locations, and
organizations) by removing event nominals from
consideration as mentions of entities.
Current extraction techniques for verbally-
anchored events rest on the assumption that most
verb phrases denote eventualities. A system to ex-
tract untyped event mentions can output all con-
stituents headed by a non-auxiliary verb with a
filter to remove instances of to be, to seem, etc.
A statistical or rule-based classifier designed to
detect event mentions of specific types can then
be applied to filter these remaining instances.
Noun phrases, in contrast, can be used to denote
anything?eventualities, entities, abstractions, and
only some are suitable for event-type filtering.
1For example, in the 2005 Automatic Content Extraction
training data, of the 5,349 event mentions, over 35% (1934)
were nominals.
168
1.1 Challenges of nominal event detection
Extraction of nominal mentions of events encom-
passes many of the fundamental challenges of
natural language processing. Creating a general
purpose lexicon of all potentially event-denoting
terms in a language is a labor-intensive task. On
top of this, even utilizing an existing lexical re-
source like WordNet requires sense disambigua-
tion at run-time because event nominals display
the full spectrum of sense distinction behaviors
(Copestake and Briscoe, 1995), including idiosyn-
cratic polysemy, as in (2); constructional poly-
semy, as in (3); coactivation, (4); and copredica-
tion, as in (5).
(2) a. On May 30 a group of Iranian mountaineers hoisted
the Iranian tricolor on the summit.
b. EU Leaders are arriving here for their two-day
summit beginning Thursday.
(3) Things are getting back to normal in the Baywood Golf
Club after a chemical spill[=event]. Clean-up crews
said the chemical spill[=result] was 99 percent water
and shouldn?t cause harm to area residents.
(4) Managing partner Naimoli said he wasn?t concerned
about recent media criticism.
(5) The construction lasted 30 years and was inaugurated
in the presence of the king in June 1684.
Given the breadth of lexical sense phenom-
ena possible with event nominals, no existing ap-
proach can address all aspects. Lexical lookup,
whether using a manually- or automatically-
constructed resource, does not take context into
consideration and so does not allow for vagueness
or unknown words. Purely word-cooccurrence-
based approaches (e.g. (Schu?tze, 1998)) are un-
suitable for cases like (3) where both senses are
possible in a single discourse. Furthermore, most
WSD techniques, whether supervised or unsuper-
vised, must be retrained for each individual lexical
item, a computationally expensive procedure both
at training and run time. To address these limita-
tions, we have developed a technique which com-
bines automatic lexical acquisition and sense dis-
ambiguation into a single-pass weakly-supervised
algorithm for detecting event nominals.
The remainder of this paper is organized as fol-
lows: Section 2 describes our probabilistic clas-
sifier. Section 3 presents experimental results of
this model, assesses its performance when boot-
strapped to increase its coverage, and compares it
to a lexical lookup technique. We describe related
work in Section 4 and present conclusions and im-
plications for future work in Section 5.
2 Weakly-supervised, simultaneous
lexical acquisition and disambiguation
In this section we present a computational method
that learns the distribution of context patterns that
correlate with event vs. non-event mentions based
on unambiguous seeds. Using these seeds we
build two Bayesian probabilistic generative mod-
els of the data, one for non-event nominals and the
other for event nominals. A classifier is then con-
structed by comparing the probability of a candi-
date instance under each model, with the winning
model determining the classification. In Section 3
we show that this classifier?s coverage can be in-
creased beyond the initial labeled seed set by au-
tomatically selecting additional seeds from a very
large unlabeled, parsed corpus.
The technique proceeds as follows. First, two
lexicons of seed terms are created by hand. One
lexicon includes nominal terms that are highly
likely to unambiguously denote events; the other
includes nominal terms that are highly likely to
unambiguously denote anything other than events.
Then, a very large corpus (>150K documents) is
parsed using a broad-coverage dependency parser
to extract all instantiations of a core set of seman-
tic dependency relations, including verb-logical
subject, verb-logical object, subject-nominal pred-
icate, noun phrase-appositive-modifier, etc.
Format of data: Each instantiation is in the
form of a dependency triple, (wa, R,wb), where
R is the relation type and where each argument is
represented just by its syntactic head, wn. Each
partial instantiation of the relation?i.e. either wa
or wb is treated as a wild card ? that can be filled
by any term?becomes a feature in the model. For
every common noun term in the corpus that ap-
pears with at least one feature (including each en-
try in the seed lexicons), the times it appears with
each feature are tabulated and stored in a matrix
of counts. Each column of the matrix represents
a feature, e.g. (occur,Verb-Subj, ?); each row rep-
resents an individual term,2 e.g. murder; and each
entry is the number of times a term appeared with
the feature in the corpus, i.e. as the instantiation of
?. For each row, if the corresponding term appears
in a lexicon it is given that designation, i.e. EVENT
or NONEVENT, or if it does not appear in either
lexicon, it is left unlabeled.
2A term is any common noun whether it is a single or
multiword expression.
169
Probabilistic model: Here we present the de-
tails of the EVENT model?the computations for
the NONEVENT model are identical. The probabil-
ity model is built using a set of seed words labeled
as EVENTs and is designed to address two desider-
ata: (I) the EVENT model should assign high prob-
ability to an unlabeled vector, v, if its features (as
recorded in the count matrix) are similar to the
vectors of the EVENT seeds; (II) each seed term
s should contribute to the model in proportion to
its prevalence in the training data.3 These desider-
ata can be incorporated naturally into a mixture
model formalism, where there are as many com-
ponents in the mixture model as there are EVENT
seed terms. Desideratum (I) is addressed by hav-
ing each component of the mixture model assign-
ing a multinomial probability to the vector, v. For
the ith mixture component built around the ith
seed, s(i), the probability is
p(v|s(i)) =
F?
f=1
(
s(i)f
)vf
,
where s(i)f is defined as the proportion of the times
the seed was seen with feature f compared to the
number of times the seed was seen with any fea-
ture f ? ? F . Thus s(i)f is simply the (i, f)th entry
in a row-sum normalized count matrix,
s(i)f =
s(i)f
?F
f ?=1 s
(i)
f ?
.
Desideratum (II) is realized using a mixture den-
sity by forming a weighted mixture of the above
multinomial distributions from all the provided
seeds i ? E . The weighting of the ith compo-
nent is fixed to be the ratio of the number of oc-
currences of the ith EVENT seed, denoted |s(i)|, to
the total number of all occurrences of event seed
words. This gives more weight to more prevalent
seed words:
p(s(i)) =
|s(i)|
?
i??E |s
(i?)|
.
The EVENT generative probability is then:
p(v|EVENT) =
?
i?E
[
p(s(i)) ? p(v|s(i))
]
.
An example of the calculation for a model with
just two event seeds and three features is given in
Figure 1. A second model is built from the non-
3The counts used here are the number of times a term is
seen with any feature in the training corpus because the in-
dexing tool used to calculate counts does not keep track of
which instances appeared simultaneously with more than one
feature. We do not expect this artifact to dramatically change
the relative seed frequencies in our model.

event seeds as well, and a corresponding probabil-
ity p(v|NONEVENT) is computed. The following
difference (log odds-ratio)
d(v) = log p(v|EVENT) ? log p(v|NONEVENT)
is then calculated. An instance v encoded as the
vector v is labeled as EVENT or NONEVENT by
examining the sign of d(v). A positive difference
d(v) classifies v as EVENT; a negative value of
d(v) classifies v as NONEVENT. Should d=0 the
classifier is considered undecided and abstains.
Each test instance is composed of a term and
the dependency triples it appears with in context
in the test document. Therefore, an instance can
be classified by (i: word): Find the unlabeled fea-
ture vector in the training data corresponding to
the term and apply the classifier to that vector,
i.e. classify the instance based on the term?s be-
havior summed across many occurrences in the
training corpus; (ii: context): Classify the instance
based only on its immediate test context vector; or
(iii: word+context): For each model, multiply the
probability information from the word vector (=i)
and the context vector (=ii). In our experiments,
all terms in the test corpus appeared at least once
(80% appearing at least 500 times) in the training
corpus, so there were no cases of unseen terms?
not suprising with a training set 1,800 times larger
than the test set. However, the ability to label
an instance based only on its immediate context
means that there is a backoff method in the case of
unseen terms.
3 Experimental Results
3.1 Training, test, and seed word data
In order to train and test the model, we created
two corpora and a lexicon of event and non-event
seeds. The training corpus consisted of 156,000
newswire documents, ?100 million words, from
the Foreign Broadcast Information Service, Lexis
170
Nexis, and other online news archives. The cor-
pus was parsed using Janya?s information extrac-
tion application, Semantex, which creates both
shallow, non-recursive parsing structures and de-
pendency links, and all (wi, R,wj) statistics were
extracted as described in Section 2. From the
1.9 million patterns, (wi, R, ?) and (?, R,wj) ex-
tracted from the corpus, the 48,353 that appeared
more than 300 times were retained as features.
The test corpus was composed of 77 additional
documents (?56K words), overlapping in time
and content but not included in the training set.
These were annotated by hand to mark event nom-
inals. Specifically, every referential noun phrase
headed by a non-proper noun was considered
for whether it denoted an achievement, accom-
plishment, activity, or process (Parsons, 1990).
Noun heads denoting any of these were marked
as EVENT, and all others were left unmarked.
All documents were first marked by a junior an-
notator, and then a non-blind second pass was per-
formed by a senior annotator (first author). Sev-
eral semantic classes were difficult to annotate be-
cause they are particularly prone to coactivation,
including terms denoting financial acts, legal acts,
speech acts, and economic processes. In addition,
for terms like mission, plan, duty, tactic, policy,
it can be unclear whether they are hyponyms of
EVENT or another abstract concept. In every case,
however, the mention was labeled as an event or
non-event depending on whether its use in that
context appeared to be more or less event-like,
respectively. Tests for the ?event-y?ness of the
context included whether an unambiguous word
would be an acceptable substitute there (e.g. funds
[=only non-event] for expenditure [either]).
To create the test data, the annotated documents
were also parsed to automatically extract all com-
mon noun-headed NPs and the dependency triples
they instantiate. Those with heads that aligned
with the offsets of an event annotation were la-
beled as events; the remainder were labeled as
non-events. Because of parsing errors, about 10%
of annotated event instances were lost, that is re-
mained unlabeled or were labeled as non-events.
So, our results are based on the set of recover-
able event nominals as a subset of all common-
noun headed NPs that were extracted. In the
test corpus there were 9,381 candidate instances,
1,579 (17%) events and 7,802 (83%) non-events.
There were 2,319 unique term types; of these, 167
types (7%) appeared both as event tokens and non-
event tokens. Some sample ambiguous terms in-
clude: behavior, attempt, settlement, deal, viola-
tion, progress, sermon, expenditure.
We constructed two lexicons of nominals to use
as the seed terms. For events, we created a list of
95 terms, such as election, war, assassination, dis-
missal, primarily based on introspection combined
with some checks on individual terms in WordNet
and other dictionaries and using Google searches
to judge how ?event-y? the term was.
To create a list of non-events, we used WordNet
and the British National Corpus. First, from the
set of all lexemes that appear in only one synset
in WordNet, all nouns were extracted along with
the topmost hypernym they appear under. From
these we retained those that both appeared on a
lemmatized frequency list of the 6,318 words with
more than 800 occurrences in the whole 100M-
word BNC (Kilgarriff, 1997) and had one of the
hypernyms GROUP, PSYCHOLOGICAL, ENTITY,
POSSESSION. We also retained select terms from
the categories STATE and PHENOMENON were la-
beled non-event seeds. Examples of the 295 non-
event seeds are corpse, electronics, bureaucracy,
airport, cattle.
Of the 9,381 test instances, 641 (6.8%) had a
term that belonged to the seed list. With respect
to types, 137 (5.9%) of the 2,319 term types in the
test data also appeared on the seed lists.
3.2 Experiments
Experiments were performed to investigate the
performance of our models, both when using orig-
inal seed lists, and also when varying the content
of the seed lists using a bootstrapping technique
that relies on the probabilistic framework of the
model. A 1,000-instance subset of the 9,381 test
data instances was used as a validation set; the re-
maining 8,381 were used as evaluation data, on
which we report all results (with the exception of
Table 3 which is on the full test set).
EXP1: Results using original seed sets Prob-
abilistic models for non-events and events were
built from the full list of 295 non-event and 95
event seeds, respectively, as described above.
Table 1 (top half: original seed set) shows the
results over the 8,381 evaluation data instances

scribed above: (i) word, (ii) context, and (iii)

correct. In the second row (FAIR), undecided an-
swers (d = 0) are left out of the total, so the
number of correct answers stays the same, but the
percentage of correct answers increases.4 Scores
are measured in terms of accuracy on the EVENT
instances, accuracy on the NONEVENT instances,
TOTAL accuracy across all instances, and the sim-
ple AVERAGE of accuracies on non-events and
events (last column). The AVERAGE score as-
sumes that performance on non-events and events
is equally important to us.
?From EXP1, we see that the behavior of a term
across an entire corpus is a better source of infor-
mation about whether a particular instance of that
term refers to an event than its immediate context.
We can further infer that this is because the imme-
diate context only provides definitive evidence for
the models in 63.0% of cases; when the context
model is not penalized for indecision, its accuracy
improves considerably. Nonetheless, in combina-
tion with the word model, immediate context does
not appear to provide much additional information
over only the word. In other words, based only
on a term?s distribution in the past, one can make
a reasonable prediction about how it will be used
when it is seen again. Consequently, it seems that
a well-constructed, i.e. domain customized, lexi-
con can classify nearly as well as a method that
also takes context into account.

tated training data created for the ACE 2005 Event
Detection and Recognition (VDR) task. Because
only event mentions of specific types are marked
in the ACE data, only recall of ACE event nomi-
nals can be measured rather than overall recall of
event nominals and accuracy on non-event nom-
inals. Results on the 1,934 nominal mentions of
events (omitting cases of d = 0) are shown in Ta-
ble 2. The performance of the hand-crafted Lex-
icon 1 on the ACE data, described in Section 3.3
below, is also included.
The fact that our method performs somewhat
better on the ACE data than on our own data, while
the lexicon approach is worse (7 points higher
vs. 3 points lower, respectively) can likely be ex-
plained by the fact that in creating our introspec-
tive seed set for events, we consulted the annota-
tion manual for ACE event types and attempted
to include in our list any unambiguous seed terms
that fit those types.
EXP3: Increasing seed set via Bootstrapping
There are over 2,300 unlabeled vectors in the train-
ing data that correspond to the words that appear
as lexical heads in the test data. These unlabeled
training vectors can be powerfully leveraged us-
ing a simple bootstrapping algorithm to improve
the individual models for non-events and events,
as follows: Step 1: For each vector v in the unla-
beled portion of training data, row-sum normalize

it to produce v? and compute a normalized mea-
sure of confidence of the algorithm?s prediction,
given by the magnitude of d(v?). Step 2: Add
those vectors most confidently classified as either
non-events or events to the seed set for non-events
or events, according to the sign of d(v?). Step 3:
Recalculate the model based on the new seed lists.
Step 4: Repeat Steps 1?3 until either no more un-
labeled vectors remain or the validation accuracy
no longer increases.
In our experiments we added vectors to each
model such that the ratio of the size of the seed
sets remained constant, i.e. 50 non-events and
16 events were added at each iteration. Using
our validation set, we determined that the boot-
strapping should stop after 15 iterations (despite
continuing for 21 iterations), at which point the
average accuracy leveled out and then began to
drop. After 15 iterations the seed set is of size
(295, 95)+(50, 16)?15 = (1045, 335). Figure 2
shows the change in the accuracy of the model as
it is bootstrapped through 15 iterations.
TOTAL accuracy improves with bootstrapping,
despite EVENT accuracy decreasing, because the
test data is heavily populated with non-events,
whose accuracy increases substantially. The AV-
ERAGE accuracy also increases, which proves that
bootstrapping is doing more than simply shifting
the bias of the classifier to the majority class. The
figure also shows that the final bootstrapped clas-
sifier comfortably outperforms Lexicon 1, impres-
sive because the lexicon contains at least 13 times
more terms than the seed lists.
EXP4: Bootstrapping with a reduced number
of seeds The size of the original seed lists were
chosen somewhat arbitrarily. In order to deter-
mine whether similar performance could be ob-
tained using fewer seeds, i.e. less human effort, we
experimented with reducing the size of the seed
lexicons used to initialize the bootstrapping.
To do this, we randomly selected a fixed frac-
tion, f%, of the (295, 95) available event and non-
event seeds, and built a classifier from this sub-
set of seeds (and discarded the remaining seeds).
We then bootstrapped the classifier?s models us-
ing the 4-step procedure described above, using
candidate seed vectors from the unlabeled train-
ing corpus, and incrementing the number of seeds
until the classifier consisted of (295, 95) seeds.
We then performed 15 additional bootstrapping it-
erations, each adding (50, 16) seeds. Since the
seeds making up the initial classifier are chosen
stochastically, we repeated this entire process 10
times and report in Figures 3(a) and 3(b) the mean
of the total and average accuracies for these 10
folds, respectively. Both plots have five traces,
with each trace corresponding the fraction f =
(20, 40, 60, 80, 100)% of labeled seeds used to
build the initial models. As a point of reference,
note that initializing with 100% of the seed lexicon
corresponds to the first point of the traces in Fig-
ure 2 (where the x-axis is marked with f =100%).
Interestingly, there is no discernible difference
in accuracy (total or average) for fractions f
greater than 20%. However, upon bootstrapping
we note the following trends. First, Figure 3(b)
shows that using a larger initial seed set increases
the maximum achievable accuracy, but this max-
imum occurs after a greater number bootstrap-
ping iterations; indeed the maximum for 100% is
achieved at 15 (or greater) iterations. This reflects
the difference in rigidity of the initial models, with
smaller initial models more easily misled by the
seeds added by bootstrapping. Second, the final
accuracies (total and average) are correlated with
the initial seed set size, which is intuitively satisfy-
ing. Third, it appears from Figure 3(a) that the to-
tal accuracy at the model size (295,95) (or 100%)
is in fact anti-correlated with the size of the ini-
tial seed set, with 20% performing best. This is
correct, but highlights the sometimes misleading
interpretation of the total accuracy: in this case
the model is defaulting to classifying anything as
a non-event (the majority class), and has a consid-
erably impoverished event model.
If one wants to do as well as Lexicon 1 after 15
iterations of bootstrapping then one needs at least

an initial seed set of size 60%. An alternative is
to perform fewer iterations, but here we see that
using 100% of the seeds comfortably achieves the
highest total and average accuracies anyway.
3.3 Comparison with existing lexicons
In order to compare our weakly-supervised proba-
bilistic method with a lexical lookup method based
on very large hand-created lexical resources, we
created three lexicons of event terms, which were
used as very simple classifiers of the test data. If
the test instance term belongs to the lexicon, it is
labeled EVENT; otherwise, it is labeled as NON-
EVENT. The results on the full test set using these
lexicons are shown in Table 3.
Lex 1 5,435 entries from NomLex (Macleod et
al., 1998), FrameNet(Baker et al, 1998), CELEX
(CEL, 1993), Timebank(Day et al, 2003).
Lex 2 13,659 entries from WordNet 2.0 hypernym
classes EVENT, ACT, PROCESS, COGNITIVE PRO-
CESS, & COMMUNICATION combined with Lex 1.
Lex 3 Combination of pre-existing lexicons in the
information extraction application from WordNet,
Oxford Advanced Learner?s Dictionary, etc.
As shown in Tables 1 and 3, the relatively
knowledge-poor method developed here using
around 400 seeds performs well compared to the
use of the much larger lexicons. For the task of
detecting nominal events, using Lexicon 1 might
be the quickest practical solution. In terms of ex-
tensibility to other semantic classes, domains, or
languages lacking appropriate existing lexical re-
sources, the advantage of our trainable method is
clear. The primary requirement of this method is
a dependency parser and a system user-developer
who can provide a set of seeds for a class of in-
terest and its complement. It should be possi-
ble in the next few years to create a dependency
parser for a language with no existing linguistic re-
sources (Klein and Manning, 2002). Rather than
having to spend the considerable person-years it
takes to create resources like FrameNet, CELEX,
and WordNet, a better alternative will be to use
weakly-supervised semantic labelers like the one
described here.
4 Related Work
In recent years an array of new approaches have
been developed using weakly-supervised tech-
niques to train classifiers or learn lexical classes
or synonyms, e.g. (Mihalcea, 2003; Riloff and
Wiebe, 2003). Several approaches make use of de-
pendency triples (Lin, 1998; Gorman and Curran,
2005). Our vector representation of the behavior
of a word type across all its instances in a corpus is
based on Lin (1998)?s DESCRIPTION OF A WORD.
Yarowsky (1995) uses a conceptually similar
technique for WSD that learns from a small set of
seed examples and then increases recall by boot-
strapping, evaluated on 12 idiosyncratically poly-
semous words. In that task, often a single disam-
biguating feature can be found in the context of a
polysemous word instance, motivating his use of
the decision list algorithm. In contrast, the goal
here is to learn how event-like or non-event-like
a set of contextual features together are. We do
not expect that many individual features correlate
unambiguously with references to events (or non-
events), only that the presence of certain features
make an event interpretation more or less likely.
This justifies our probabilistic Bayesian approach,
which performs well given its simplicity.
Thelen and Riloff (2002) use a bootstrapping al-
gorithm to learn semantic lexicons of nouns for
six semantic categories, one of which is EVENTS.
For events, only 27% of the 1,000 learned words
are correct. Their experiments were on a much
smaller scale, however, using the 1,700 document
MUC-4 data as a training corpus and using only
10 seeds per category.
Most prior work on event nominals does not try
to classify them as events or non-events, but in-
stead focuses on labeling the argument roles based
on extrapolating information about the argument
structure of the verbal root (Dahl et al, 1987; La-
pata, 2002; Pradhan et al, 2004). Meyers, et al
(1998) describe how to extend a tool for extrac-
tion of verb-based events to corresponding nomi-
nalizations. Hull and Gomez (1996) design a set
of rule-based algorithms to determine the sense of
a nominalization and identify its arguments.
5 Conclusions
We have developed a novel algorithm for label-
ing nominals as events that combines WSD and
lexical acquisition. After automatically bootstrap-
ping the seed set, it performs better than static lex-
icons many times the original seed set size. Also,

it is more robust than lexical lookup as it can also
classify unknown words based on their immediate
context and can remain agnostic in the absence of
sufficient evidence.
Future directions for this work include applying
it to other semantic labeling tasks and to domains
other than general news. An important unresolved
issue is the difficulty of formulating an appropriate
seed set to give good coverage of the complement
of the class to be labeled without the use of a re-
source like WordNet.
