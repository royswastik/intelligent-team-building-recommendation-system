Named entity recognition of gene names, pro-
tein names, cell-lines, and other biologically rele-
vant concepts has received significant attention by
the research community. In this work, we consid-
ered named entity recognition of experimental tech-
niques in biomedical articles. In our system to mine
gene and disease associations, each association is
categorized by the techniques used to derive the as-
sociation. Categories are used to weight or remove
associations, such as removing associations derived
from microarray experiments.
We report on a pilot study to identify experimen-
tal techniques. Three main activities are discussed:
manual annotation, lexicon-based tagging, and doc-
ument classification. Analysis of manual annota-
tion suggests several interesting linguistic character-
istics arise. Two lexicon-based tagging approaches
demonstrate little agreement, suggesting sophisti-
cated tagging algorithms may be necessary. Docu-
ment classification using abstracts and titles is com-
pared with full-text classification. In most cases, ab-
stracts and titles show comparable performance to
full-text.
Corpus We built a corpus around our interest in
gene associations with breast cancer to leverage the
domain expertise of the authors. The corpus con-
sisted of 247 sampled from 2571 papers associating
breast cancer with a human gene in EntrezGene.
Manual Annotation Manual annotation was pri-
marily performed by a graduate student in bioin-
formatics and a computer science Ph.D. with a re-
search emphasis in bioinformatics. Annotators were
instructed to highlight direct mentions of experimen-
tal techniques. During the study, we noted low inter-
annotator agreement and stopped the manual pro-
cess after annotating 102 of 247 documents.
Results were analyzed for linguistic characteris-
tics. Experimental technique mentions appear with
varying frequency in 6 typical document sections:
Title, Abstract, Introduction, Materials and Meth-
ods, Results and Discussion. In some sections,
such as Introduction, mentions are often for refer-
ences and not the current document. Techniques
such as transfection and immunoblotting, demon-
strated diverse morphology. Other characteristics in-
cluded use of synonyms and abbreviations, conjunc-
tive phrases, and endophora.
Tagging Tagging is commonly used for named en-
tity recognition. In our context, associations are cat-
egorized by generating a list of all tagged techniques
tagged in a document.
Two taggers were tested on 247 documents to
investigate the efficacy of two lexicons ? MeSH
and UMLS ? containing experimental techniques.
One approach used regular expressions for terms
and permuted terms in the Investigative Techniques
MeSH subhierarchy. The other used a natural lan-
guage approach based on MetaMap Transfer (Aron-
son, 2001), mapping text to UMLS entries with the
Laboratory Procedure semantic type (ID: T059).
Low inter-annotator agreement between taggers
was exhibited with a maximum ? of 0.220. Both tag-
gers exhibited limitations ? failing to properly tag
phrases such as ?Northern and Western analyses? ?
and neither one is clearly superior to the other.

Table 1: Precision/Recall/F1-scores for classifiers with different vocabulary sizes.
Document Classification Document classifica-
tion was also used to obtain a list of utilized exper-
imental techniques. Each article is assigned to one
or more classes corresponding to techniques used to
generate results.
Two distinct questions were investigated. First,
how well does classification perform if only the ab-
stract and title of the article are available? Second,
how does vocabulary size affect the classification?
Multinomial Na??ve Bayes models were imple-
mented in Rainbow (McCallum, 1996; McCallum
and Nigam, 1998) for 24 MeSH experimental tech-
niques. Document frequency in each class ranged
from 10 (Pedigree) to 144 (Electrophoresis). Vocab-
ularies consist of top information gain ranked words.
Classifiers were evaluated by precision, recall, and
F1-scores averaged over 100 runs. The corpus was
split into 2/3 training and 1/3 testing, randomly cho-
sen for each run.
Selected results are shown in Table 1. Full-text
classifiers performed better than abstract based clas-
sifiers with a few exceptions: ?Sequence Align-
ment? and ?Gene Transfer Techniques?. The per-
formance of abstract and full-text classifiers is com-
parable: F1 scores often differ by less than 5
points. Smaller vocabularies tend to improve the
recall and overall F1 scores, while larger ones im-
proved precision. Classifiers for low frequency (<
25) techniques generally performed poorly. One
class, ?Pedigree?, performed surprisingly well, with
a maximum F1 of 76.6.
Considering that Na??ve Bayes models are often
baseline models and the small size of the corpus,
classification performance is good.
Related and Future Work For comprehensive
reviews of current work in biomedical literature
mining, refer to (Cohen and Hersh, 2005) and
(Krallinger et al, 2005). As future work, we will
continue manual annotation, validate the informa-
tive capacity of sections with experiments similar to
Sinclair and Webber (Sinclair and Webber, 2004),
and investigate improvements in tagging and classi-
fication.
