Abstract 
Most of the Chinese word segmentation 
systems utilizes monolingual dictionary 
and are used for monolingual processing.  
For the tasks of machine translation (MT) 
and cross-language information retrieval 
(CLIR), another translation dictionary 
may be used to transfer the words of 
documents from the source languages to 
target languages.  The inconsistencies re-
sulting from the two types of dictionaries 
(segmentation dictionary and transfer 
dictionary) may produce some problems 
for MT and CLIR.  This paper shows the 
effectiveness of the external resources 
(bilingual dictionary and word list) for 
Chinese word segmentations. 
1 Introduction 
Most of the Chinese word segmentations are 
used for monolingual processing.  In general, the 
word segmentation program utilizes the word 
entries, part-of-speech (POS) information (Chen 
and Liu, 1992) in a monolingual dictionary, 
segmentation rules (Palmer, 1997), and some 
statistical information (Sproat, et al, 1994).  For 
the tasks of machine translation (MT) (Bian and 
Chen, 1998) and cross-language information re-
trieval (CLIR) (Bian and Chen, 2000), another 
translation dictionary may be used to transfer the 
words of documents from the source languages 
to target languages.  Because of the inconsisten-
cies resulting from the two types of dictionaries 
(segmentation dictionary and transfer dictionary), 
this approach has the problems that some seg-
mented words cannot be found in the transfer 
dictionary. 
 In this paper, we focus on the effectiveness of 
the Chinese word segmentation using different 
dictionaries.  Four different dictionaries (or word 
lists) and two different testing collections (testing 
data) are used to evaluate the results of the Chi-
nese word segmentation. 
2 Chinese Word Segmentation System 
The segmentation system used only the vari-
ous dictionaries in this design.  In this paper, the 
other possible resources (POS, segmentation 
rules, word segmentation guide, and statistical 
information) are ignored to test the average per-
formance between different testing collections 
specially followed the different segmented 
guidelines.   
 
The longest-matching method is adopted in 
this Chinese segmentation system.  The segmen-
tation processing searches for a dictionary entry 
corresponding to the longest sequence of Chinese 
characters from left to right.  The system pro-
vided the approximate matching to search a sub-
string of the input with the entry in the dictionary 
if no total matching is found.  For example, the 
system will segment the input ??????? 
???????? as ??? ?? ?? ?? ?
? ? ??? which matched the term with the 
entry ????? in dictionary if no entry ???? 
found.  
2.1 Various Dictionaries 
  The word segmentation are evaluated using 
different dictionaries (or word lists) and different 
testing collections (testing data). There are four 
dictionaries are used: the first one is converted 
from an English-Chinese bilingual dictionary, 
and the other three are extracted from the train-
ing corpora. 
The original English-Chinese dictionary (Bian 
and Chen, 1998), which containing about 67,000 
English word entries, is converted to a new Chi-
nese-English dictionary (called CEDIC later).  
There are 125,719 Chinese word entries in this 
CEDIC.   
The terms in the various training corpora (the 
Sinica Corpus and the City University Corpus) 
are extracted to build the different word lists as 
the segmentation dictionaries (called CKIP and 
CityU later).  The tokens starting with the special 
166
characters or punctuation marks are ignored.  
The following shows some examples: 
?, ????, ???, ?, ?, ?, ?, , ?,  
????, ????, ?, ???, ?, ?, ? 
????????, ?, ,?, ?, .com,  
 
Table 1 lists the number of tokens (#tokens), 
the number of ignored tokens (#ignored), the 
number of words (#words), and the unique words 
(#unique) for each dictionaries.  There are 
140,971 unique words are extracted from the 
training collection of Sinica Corpus, and 75,433 
respected to the training set of the City 
University Corpus. These two dictionaries are 
combined to another dictionary which containing 
174,398 unique words.

3 Experimental Results 
To evaluate the results of Chinese word seg-
mentations, we implement 8 experiments (runs) 
using the 4 different dictionaries (CEDIC, CK, 
CT, and CK+CT) mentioned in previous section.  
Two test collections (the Sinica Corpus and the 
City University Corpus) are used to measure the 
precision, recall, and an evenly-weighted F-
measure for the Chinese words segmentations.   
Table 2 shows the F-measure of the 
experimental results, and the Figure 1 illustrates 
the comparisons of the segmentation perform-
ances.  The symbol (*) indicates that the run is a 
closed test, which only uses the training material 
from the training data for the particular corpus.  
We can find that the larger dictionary (CK+CT) 
produces better segmentation results even the 
word lists are combined from the different re-
sources (corpora) and followed the different 
guidelines of word segmentations.

3.1 Error Analysis 
3.1.1 Format Error of Result File 
The results file for word segmentation is re-
quired to appear with one line for each sen-
tence/line in the test file with words and punctua-
tion separated by whitespace.  Our system makes 
some mistakes to produce no whitespace before 
English terms and Arabic numbers, and produce 
no whitespace after Chinese punctuation marks.  
This formatting problem has made many adja-
cent segmented words to be evaluated as errors.  
A sentence with such errors is listed below 
 
(Our Answer) 
? ???? ?? ??? ? ?? ?? ?? ? 
?? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? ??
? ?? ? ??? 9? ?? ??? ?? ??? 
?? ??? ?? ? ?9+2 ? ? ? 
 
(Standard) 
? ???? ?? ? ?? ? ?? ?? ?? ? 
?? ?  ?? ?  ?? ? ??  ?  ??  ?  ?
? ? ?? ? ?? ? ?? 9 ? ?? ? ?? ?
? ? ?? ?? ??? ? ?? ? 9+2 ? ? ? 
 
The standard answer of the testing collection 
(CityU) of the City University Corpus has 7,512 
sentences and 220,147 words.  The total number 
of English terms, Arabic numbers, and Chinese 
punctuation marks is 37,644.  Such formatting 
problem makes the error rate of about 30% for 
the City University Corpus. 
 
3.1.2 Different Viewpoints of Segmentations 
In our experiments, there are different word 
lists extracted from the different training corpora.  
Some errors are produced because of the differ-
167
ent results of word segmentations in the training 
corpora according to the different guidelines.  
Table 3 shows some different results. The first 
column (CKIP) is the standard answer of the test-
ing collection of Sinica Corpus, and the second 
column (HFUIM) is our answer.  The third and 
fourth columns are the words with their frequen-
cies appeared in the training collections of Sinica 
Corpus and City University Corpus.  For exam-
ple, our system produces the word ????, but 
the standard answer of Sinica Corpus is ??? and 
???.  However, the word ???? appear 61 
times in the training collection of City University 
Corpus.

3.1.3 Inconsistency of Word Segmentation 
Some errors of word segmentations are re-
ported because of the inconsistency of word 
segmentations.  The following shows such a 
problem.   For example, the word ???? appears 
317 times in the training data, but it has been 
treated as two terms (??? and ???) 19 times in 
the golden standard of the testing data.

4 Conclusion 
In this paper, we discuss the effectiveness of 
the Chinese word segmentation using various 
dictionaries.  In the experimental results, we can 
find that the larger dictionary will produce better 
segmentation results even the word lists are 
combined from the different resources (corpora) 
and followed the different guidelines of word 
segmentations.  Some results show that the ex-
ternal resource (e.g., the bilingual dictionary) can 
perform the task of Chinese word segmentation 
better than the monolingual dictionary which 
extracted from the training corpus.
