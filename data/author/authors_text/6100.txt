Abstract
Query expansion techniques generally se-
lect new query terms from a set of top
ranked documents. Although a user?s
manual judgment of those documents
would much help to select good expansion
terms, it is difficult to get enough feedback
from users in practical situations. In this
paper we propose a query expansion tech-
nique which performs well even if a user
notifies just a relevant document and a
non-relevant document. In order to tackle
this specific condition, we introduce two
refinements to a well-known query expan-
sion technique. One is application of a
transductive learning technique in order to
increase relevant documents. The other is
a modified parameter estimation method
which laps the predictions by multiple
learning trials and try to differentiate the
importance of candidate terms for expan-
sion in relevant documents. Experimen-
tal results show that our technique outper-
forms some traditional query expansion
methods in several evaluation measures.
1 Introduction
Query expansion is a simple but very useful tech-
nique to improve search performance by adding
some terms to an initial query. While many query
expansion techniques have been proposed so far, a
standard method of performing is to use relevance
information from a user (Ruthven, 2003). If we
can use more relevant documents in query expan-
sion, the likelihood of selecting query terms achiev-
ing high search improvement increases. However it
is impractical to expect enough relevance informa-
tion. Some researchers said that a user usually noti-
fies few relevance feedback or nothing (Dumais and
et al, 2003).
In this paper we investigate the potential perfor-
mance of query expansion under the condition that
we can utilize little relevance information, espe-
cially we only know a relevant document and a non-
relevant document. To overcome the lack of rele-
vance information, we tentatively increase the num-
ber of relevant documents by a machine learning
technique called Transductive Learning. Compared
with ordinal inductive learning approach, this learn-
ing technique works even if there is few training ex-
amples. In our case, we can use many documents
in a hit-list, however we know the relevancy of few
documents. When applying query expansion, we use
those increased documents as if they were true rel-
evant ones. When applying the learning, there oc-
curs some difficult problems of parameter settings.
We also try to provide a reasonable resolution for
the problems and show the effectiveness of our pro-
posed method in experiments.
The point of our query expansion method is that
we focus on the availability of relevance information
in practical situations. There are several researches
which deal with this problem. Pseudo relevance
feedback which assumes top n documents as rele-
vant ones is one example. This method is simple and
relatively effective if a search engine returns a hit-
963
list which contains a certain number of relative doc-
uments in the upper part. However, unless this as-
sumption holds, it usually gives a worse ranking than
the initial search. Thus several researchers propose
some specific procedure to make pseudo feedback
be effective (Yu and et al 2003; Lam-Adesina and
Jones, 2001). In another way, Onoda (Onoda et al,
2004) tried to apply one-class SVM (Support Vec-
tor Machine) to relevance feedback. Their purpose
is to improve search performance by using only non-
relevant documents. Though their motivation is sim-
ilar to ours in terms of applying a machine learning
method to complement the lack of relevance infor-
mation, the assumption is somewhat different. Our
assumption is to utilizes manual but the minimum
relevance judgment.
Transductive leaning has already been applied in
the field of image retrieval (He and et al, 2004). In
this research, they proposed a transductive method
called the manifold-ranking algorithm and showed
its effectiveness by comparing with active learn-
ing based Support Vector Machine. However, their
setting of relevance judgment is not different from
many other traditional researches. They fix the total
number of images that are marked by a user to 20.
As we have already claimed, this setting is not prac-
tical because most users feel that 20 is too much for
judgment. We think none of research has not yet an-
swered the question. For relevance judgment, most
of the researches have adopted either of the follow-
ing settings. One is the setting of ?Enough relevant
documents are available?, and the other is ?No rele-
vant document is available?. In contrast to them, we
adopt the setting of ?Only one relevant document is
available?. Our aim is to achieve performance im-
provement with the minimum effort of judging rele-
vancy of documents.
The reminder of this paper is structured as fol-
lows. Section 2 describes two fundamental tech-
niques for our query expansion method. Section 3
explains a technique to complement the smallness
of manual relevance judgment. Section 4 introduces
a whole procedure of our query expansion method
step by step. Section 5 shows empirical evidence
of the effectiveness of our method compared with
two traditional query expansion methods. Section 6
investigates the experimental results more in detail.
Finally, Section 7 summarizes our findings.
2 Basic Methods
2.1 Query Expansion
So far, many query expansion techniques have been
proposed. While some techniques focus on the
domain specific search which prepares expansion
terms in advance using some domain specific train-
ing documents (Flake and et al 2002; Oyama and et
al, 2001), most of techniques are based on relevance
feedback which is given automatically or manually.
In this technique, expansion terms are selected
from relevant documents by a scoring function. The
Robertson?s wpq method (Ruthven, 2003) is often
used as such a scoring function in many researches
(Yu and et al 2003; Lam-Adesina and Jones, 2001).
We also use it as our basic scoring function. It cal-
culates the score of each term by the following for-
mula.
wpqt =
(rt
R ?
nt ? rt
N ? R
)
?log rt/(R ? rt)(nt ? rt)/(N ? nt ? R + rt)
(1)
where rt is the number of seen relevant documents
containing term t. nt is the number of documents
containing t. R is the number of seen relevant doc-
uments for a query. N is the number of documents
in the collection. The second term of this formula
is called the Robertson/Spark Jones weight (Robert-
son, 1990) which is the core of the term weighting
function in the Okapi system (Robertson, 1997).
This formula is originated in the following for-
mula.
wpqt = (pt ? qt) log
pt(1? qt)
qt(1? pt)
(2)
where pt is the probability that a term t appears in
relevant documents. qt is the probability that a term
t appears in non-relevant documents. We can easily
notice that it is very important how the two prob-
ability of pt and qt should be estimated. The first
formula estimates pt with rtR and qt with
Nt?Rt
N?R . For
the good estimation of pt and qt, plenty of relevant
document is necessary. Although pseudo feedback
which automatically assumes top n documents as
relevant is one method and is often used, its perfor-
mance heavily depends on the quality of an initial
search. As we show later, pseudo feedback has lim-
ited performance.
We here consider a query expansion technique
which uses manual feedback. It is no wonder
964
manual feedback shows excellent and stable perfor-
mance if enough relevant documents are available,
hence the challenge is how it keeps high perfor-
mance with less amount of manual relevance judg-
ment. In particular, we restrict the manual judgment
to the minimum amount, namely only a relevant
document and a non-relevant document. In this
assumption, the problem is how to find more rele-
vant documents based on a relevant document and a
non-relevant document. We use transductive learn-
ing technique which is suitable for the learning prob-
lem where there is small training examples.
2.2 Transductive Learning
Transductive learning is a machine learning tech-
nique based on the transduction which directly de-
rives the classification labels of test data without
making any approximating function from training
data (Vapnik, 1998). Because it does not need to
make approximating function, it works well even if
the number of training data is small.
The learning task is defined on a data set X
of n points. X consists of training data set
L = (x?1, x?2, ..., x?l) and test data set U =
(x?l+1, x?l+2, ..., x?l+u); typically l ? u. The purpose
of the learning is to assign a label to each data point
in U under the condition that the label of each data
point in L are given.
Recently, transductive learning or semi-
supervised learning is becoming an attractive
subject in the machine learning field. Several
algorithms have been proposed so far (Joachims,
1999; Zhu and et al, 2003; Blum and et al, 2004)
and they show the advantage of this approach in
various learning tasks. In order to apply transductive
learning to our query expansion, we select an algo-
rithm called ?Spectral Graph Transducer (SGT)?
(Joachims, 2003), which is one of the state of the art
and the best transductive learning algorithms. SGT
formalizes the problem of assigning labels to U with
an optimization problem of the constrained ratiocut.
By solving the relaxed problem, it produces an
approximation to the original solution.
When applying SGT to query expansion, X cor-
responds to a set of top n ranked documents in a
hit-list. X does not corresponds to a whole docu-
ment collection because the number of documents
in a collection is too huge1 for any learning sys-
tem to process. L corresponds to two documents
with manual judgments, a relevant document and
a non-relevant document. Furthermore, U corre-
sponds to the documents of X ? L whose rele-
vancy is unknown. SGT is used to produce the rel-
evancy of documents in U . SGT actually assigns
values around ?+ ? ? for documents possibly be-
ing relevant and ?? ? ? for documents possibly be-
ing non-relevant. ?+ = +
?
1?fp
fp , ?? = ?
?
fp
1?fp ,
? = 12(?+ + ??), and fp is the fraction of relevant
documents in X . We cannot know the true value of
fp in advance, thus we have to estimate its approxi-
mation value before applying SGT.
According to Joachims, parameter k (the number
of k-nearest points of a data x?) and d (the number
of eigen values to ...) give large influence to SGT?s
learning performance. Of course those two parame-
ters should be set carefully. However, besides them,
fp is much more important for our task because it
controls the learning performance. Since extremely
small L (actually |L| = 2 is our setting) give no
information to estimate the true value of fp, we do
not strain to estimate its single approximation value
but propose a new method to utilize the results of
learning with some promising fp. We describe the
method in the next section.
3 Parameter Estimations based on
Multiple SGT Predictions
3.1 Sampling for Fraction of Positive Examples
SGT prepares 2 estimation methods to set fp au-
tomatically. One is to estimate from the fraction
of positive examples in training examples. This
method is not suitable for our task because fp is
always fixed to 0.5 by this method if the number
of training examples changes despite the number of
relevant documents is small in many practical situa-
tions. The other is to estimate with a heuristic that
the difference between a setting of fp and the frac-
tion of positive examples actually assigned by SGT
should be as small as possible. The procedure pro-
vided by SGT starts from fp = 0.5 and the next fp is
set to the fraction of documents assigned as relevant
in the previous SGT trial. It repeats until fp changes
1Normally it is more than ten thousand.
965
Input
Ntr // the number of training examples
Output
S // a set of sampling points
piv = ln(Ntr); // sampling interval
nsp = 0; // the number of sampling points
for(i = piv; i ? Ntr ? 1; i+ = piv){
add i to ;
nsp++;
if(nsp == 10){ exit; }
}
Figure 1: Pseudo code of sampling procedure for fp
five times or the difference converges less than 0.01.
This method is neither works well because the con-
vergence is not guaranteed at all.
Presetting of fp is primarily very difficult problem
and consequently we take another approach which
laps the predictions of multiple SGT trials with some
sampled fp instead of setting a single fp. This ap-
proach leads to represent a relevant document by not
a binary value but a real value between 0 and 1. The
sampling procedure for fp is illustrated in Figure 1.
In this procedure, sampling interval changes accord-
ing to the number of training examples. In our pre-
liminary test, the number of sampling points should
be around 10. However this number is adhoc one,
thus we may need another value for another corpus.
3.2 Modified estimations for pt and qt
Once we get a set of sampling points S = {f ip :
i = 1 ? 10}, we run SGT with each f ip and laps
each resultant of prediction to calculate pt and qt as
follows.
pt =
?
i rit
?
i Ri
(3)
qt =
?
i nt ? rit
?
i N ?Ri
(4)
Here, Ri is the number of documents which SGT
predicts as relevant with ith value of f ip, and rit is
the number of documents in Ri where a term t ap-
pears. In each trial, SGT predicts the relevancy of
documents by binary value of 1 (for relevant) and 0
(for non-relevant), yet by lapping multiple resultant
of predictions, the binary prediction value changes
to a real value which can represents the relevancy of
documents in more detail. The main merit of this
approach in comparison with fixing fp to a single
value, it can differentiate a value of pt if Ntr is small.
4 Expansion Procedures
We here explain a whole procedure of our query ex-
pansion method step by step.
1. Initial Search: A retrieval starts by inputting a
query for a topic to an IR system.
2. Relevance Judgment for Documents in a
Hit-List: The IR system returns a hit-list for
the initial query. Then the hit-list is scanned
to check whether each document is relevant or
non-relevant in descending order of the rank-
ing. In our assumption, this reviewing pro-
cess terminates when a relevant document and
a non-relevant one are found.
3. Finding more relevant documents by trans-
ductive learning: Because only two judged
documents are too few to estimate pt and qt
correctly, our query expansion tries to increase
the number of relevant documents for the wpq
formula using the SGT transductive learning al-
gorithm. As shown in Figure2, SGT assigns a
value of the possibility to be relevant for the
topic to each document with no relevance judg-
ment (documents under the dashed line in the
Fig) based on two judged documents (docu-
ments above the dashed line in the Figure).
1. Document     1
2. Document     0
3. Document     ?
4. Document     ?
              :

ments

4. Selecting terms to expand the initial query:
Our query expansion method calculates the
score of each term appearing in relevant docu-
ments (including documents judged as relevant
by SGT) using wpq formula, and then selects
a certain number of expansion terms according
to the ranking of the score. Selected terms are
added to the initial query. Thus an expanded
query consists of the initial terms and added
terms.
5. The Next Search with an expanded query:
The expanded query is inputted to the IR sys-
tem and a new hit-list will be returned. One
cycle of query expansion finishes at this step.
In the above procedures, we naturally intro-
duced transductive learning into query expan-
sion as the effective way in order to automati-
cally find some relevant documents. Thus we
do not need to modify a basic query expan-
sion procedure and can fully utilize the poten-
tial power of the basic query expansion.
The computational cost of transductive learn-
ing is not so much. Actually transductive learn-
ing takes a few seconds to label 100 unla-
beled documents and query expansion with all
the labeled documents also takes a few sec-
onds. Thus our system can expand queries suf-
ficiently quick in practical applications.
5 Experiments
This section provides empirical evidence on how
our query expansion method can improve the per-
formance of information retrieval. We compare our
method with other traditional methods.
5.1 Environmental Settings
5.1.1 Data set
We use the TREC-8 data set (Voorhees and Har-
man, 1999) for our experiment. The document cor-
pus contains about 520,000 news articles. Each doc-
ument is preprocessed by removing stopwords and
stemming. We also use fifty topics (No.401-450)
and relevance judgments which are prepared for ad-
hoc task in the TREC-8. Queries for an initial search
are nouns extracted from the title tag in each topic.
5.1.2 Retrieval Models
We use two representative retrieval models which
are bases of the Okapi (Robertson, 1997) and
SMART systems. They showed highest perfor-
mance in the TREC-8 competition.
Okapi : The weight function in Okapi is BM25. It
calculates each document?s score by the follow-
ing formula.
score(d) =
?
T?Q
w(1) ? (k1 + 1)tf(k3 + 1)qtf(K + tf)(k3 + qtf)
(5)
w(1) = log (rt + 0.5)/(R ? rt + 0.5)(nt ? rt + 0.5)/(N ? nt ? R + rt + 0.5)
(6)
K = k1
(
(1 ? b) + b dlavdl
)
(7)
where Q is a query containing terms T , tf
is the term?s frequency in a document, qtf is
the term?s frequency in a text from which Q
was derived. rt and nt are described in sec-
tion 2. K is calculated by (7), where dl and
avdl denote the document length and the av-
erage document length. In our experiments,
we set k1 = 1.2, k3 = 1000, b = 0.75, and
avdl = 135.6. Terms for query expansion are
ranked in decreasing order of rt ? w(1) for the
following Okapi?s retrieval tests without SGT
(Okapi manual and Okapi pseudo) to make
conditions the same as of TREC-8.
SMART : The SMART?s weighting function is as
follows2.
score(d) =
?
T?Q
{1 + ln(1 + ln(tf))} ? log(N + 1df ) ? pivot (8)
pivot = 1
0.8 + 0.2 ? dlavdl
(9)
df is the term?s document frequency. tf , dl and
avdl are the same as Okapi. When doing rele-
vance feedback, a query vector is modified by
the following Rocchio?s method (with parame-
ters ? = 3, ? = 2, ? = 2).

Drel and Dnrel are sets of seen relevant and
non-relevant documents respectively. Terms
for query expansion are ranked in decreasing
order of the above Rocchio?s formula.
Table 1 shows their initial search results of Okapi
(Okapi ini) and SMART (SMART ini). We adopt
five evaluation measures. Their meanings are as fol-
lows (Voorhees and Harman, 1999).
P10 : The precision after the first 10 documents are
retrieved.
P30 : The precision after the first 30 documents are
retrieved.
R-Prec : The precision after the first R documents
are retrieved, where R is the number of relevant
documents for the current topic.
MAP : Mean average precision (MAP) is the aver-
age precision for a single topic is the mean of
the precision obtained after each relevant doc-
ument is retrieved (using zero as the precision
for relevant documents that are not retrieved).
R05P : Recall at the rank where precision first dips
below 0.5 (after at least 10 documents have
been retrieved).
The performance of query expansion or relevance
feedback is usually evaluated on a residual collec-
tion where seen documents are removed. However
we compare our method with pseudo feedback based
ones, thus we do not use residual collection in the
following experiments.
5.1.3 Settings of Manual Feedback
For manual feedback, we set an assumption that
a user tries to find relevant and non-relevant doc-
uments within only top 10 documents in the result
of an initial search. If a topic has no relevant doc-
ument or no non-relevant document in the top 10
documents, we do not apply manual feedback, in-
stead we consider the result of the initial search for

such topics. There are 8 topics 3 which we do not
apply manual feedback methods.
5.2 Basic Performance
Firstly, we evaluate the basic performance of our
query expansion method by changing the number
of training examples. Since our method is based on
Okapi model, we represent it as Okapi sgt (with pa-
rameters k = 0.5?Ntr, d = 0.8?Ntr. k is the num-
ber of nearest neighbors, d is the number of eigen
values to use and Ntr is the number of training ex-
amples).
Table 2-5 shows five evaluation measures of
Okapi sgt when the number of expansion terms
changes. We test 20, 50 and 100 as the number of
training examples and 5, 10 15 and 20 for the num-
ber of expansion terms. As for the number of train-
ing examples, performance of 20 and 50 does not
differ so much in all the number of expansion terms.
However performance of 100 is clearly worse than
of 20 and 50. The number of expansion terms does
not effect so much in every evaluation measures. In
the following experiments, we compare the results
of Okapi sgt when the number of training examples
is 50 with other query expansion methods.
3Topic numbers are 409, 410, 424, 425, 431, 432, 437 and
450

SMART man 0.434 0.309 0.250 0.222 0.174
5.3 Comparison with other Manual Feedback
Methods
We next compare our query expansion method with
the following manual feedback methods.
Okapi man : This method simply uses only one
relevant document judged by hand. This is
called incremental relevance feedback (Aal-
bersberg, 1992; Allan, 1996; Iwayama, 2000).
SMART man : This method is SMART?s manual
relevance feedback (with parameters ? = 3,
? = 2, ? = 0). ? is set to 0 because the perfor-
mance is terrible if ? is set to 2.
Table 6 shows the mean average precision of
three methods when the number of expansion terms
changes. Since the number of feedback docu-
ments is extremely small, two methods except for
Okapi sgt get worse than their initial searches.
Okapi man slightly decreases as the number of ex-
pansion terms increases. Contrary, SMART man
do not change so much as the number of expansion
terms increases. Table 7 shows another evaluation
measures with 10 terms expanded. It is clear that
Okapi sgt outperforms the other two methods.
5.4 Comparison with Pseudo Feedback
Methods
We finally compare our query expansion method
with the following pseudo feedback methods.
Okapi pse : This is a pseudo version of Okapi
which assumes top 10 documents in the initial
search as relevant ones as well as TREC-8 set-
tings.

It also assumes top 10 documents as relevant
ones. In addition, it assumes top 500-1000 doc-
uments as non-relevant ones.
In TREC-8, above two methods uses TREC1-5 disks
for query expansion and a phase extraction tech-
nique. However we do not adopt these methods in
our experiments4. Since these methods showed the
highest performance in the TREC-8 adhoc task, it
is reasonable to compare our method with them as
competitors.
Table 8 shows the mean average precision of
three methods when the number of expansion terms
changes. Performance does not differ so much if the
number of expansion terms changes. Okapi sgt out-
performs at any number of expansion. Table 9 shows
the results in other evaluation measures. Okapi sgt
also outperforms except for R05P. In particular, per-
formance in P10 is quite well. It is preferable behav-
ior for the use in practical situations.
6 Discussion
In the experiments, the feedback documents for
Okapi sgt is top ranked ones. However some users
do not select such documents. They may choose
another relevant and non-relevant documents which
rank in top 10. Thus we test an another experiment
where relevant and non-relevant documents are se-
lected randomly from top 10 rank. Table 10 shows
the result. Compared with table 2, the performance
seems to become slightly worse. This shows that a
4Thus the performance in our experiments is a bit worse than
the result of TREC-8

7 Conclusion
In this paper we proposed a novel query expansion
method which only use the minimum manual judg-
ment. To complement the lack of relevant docu-
ments, this method utilizes the SGT transductive
learning algorithm to predict the relevancy of un-
judged documents. Since the performance of SGT
much depends on an estimation of the fraction of
relevant documents, we propose a method to sam-
ple some good fraction values. We also propose a
method to laps the predictions of multiple SGT tri-
als with above sampled fraction values and try to
differentiate the importance of candidate terms for
expansion in relevant documents. The experimental
results showed our method outperforms other query
expansion methods in the evaluations of several cri-
teria.
