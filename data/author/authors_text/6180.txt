Abstract
This paper shows that the web can be em-
ployed to obtain frequencies for bigrams
that are unseen in a given corpus. We
describe a method for retrieving counts
for adjective-noun, noun-noun, and verb-
object bigrams from the web by querying
a search engine. We evaluate this method
by demonstrating that web frequencies
and correlate with frequencies obtained
from a carefully edited, balanced corpus.
We also perform a task-based evaluation,
showing that web frequencies can reliably
predict human plausibility judgments.
1 Introduction
In two recent papers, Banko and Brill (2001a;
2001b) criticize the fact that current NLP algo-
rithms are typically optimized, tested, and compared
on fairly small data sets (corpora with millions of
words), even though data sets several orders of mag-
nitude larger are available, at least for some tasks.
Banko and Brill go on to demonstrate that learning
algorithms typically used for NLP tasks benefit sig-
nificantly from larger training sets, and their perfor-
mance shows no sign of reaching an asymptote as
the size of the training set increases.
Arguably, the largest data set that is available
for NLP is the web, which currently consists of
at least 968 million pages.1 Data retrieved from
the web therefore provides enormous potential

March 2002, as estimated by Search Engine Showdown (see
http://www.searchengineshowdown.com/).
for training NLP algorithms, if Banko and Brill?s
findings generalize. There is a small body of
existing research that tries to harness the potential
of the web for NLP. Grefenstette and Nioche (2000)
and Jones and Ghani (2000) use the web to
generate corpora for languages where elec-
tronic resources are scarce, while Resnik (1999)
describes a method for mining the web for bilin-
gual texts. Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999) and
Agirre and Martinez (2000) use the web for word
sense disambiguation, and Volk (2001) proposes a
method for resolving PP attachment ambiguities
based on web data.
A particularly interesting application is pro-
posed by Grefenstette (1998), who uses the web
for example-based machine translation. His task is
to translate compounds from French into English,
with corpus evidence serving as a filter for candi-
date translations. As an example consider the French
compound groupe de travail. There are five transla-
tion of groupe and three translations for travail (in
the dictionary that Grefenstette (1998) is using), re-
sulting in 15 possible candidate translations. Only
one of them, viz., work group has a high corpus
frequency, which makes it likely that this is the
correct translation into English. Grefenstette (1998)
observes that this approach suffers from an acute
data sparseness problem if the corpus counts are
obtained from a conventional corpus such as the
British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 1995).
However, as Grefenstette (1998) demonstrates, this
problem can be overcome by obtaining counts
through web searches, instead of relying on the
BNC. Grefenstette (1998) therefore effectively uses
the web as a way of obtaining counts for compounds
that are sparse in the BNC.

While this is an important initial result, it raises
the question of the generality of the proposed ap-
proach to overcoming data sparseness. It remains
to be shown that web counts are generally useful
for approximating data that is sparse or unseen in
a given corpus. It seems possible, for instance, that
Grefenstette?s (1998) results are limited to his par-
ticular task (filtering potential translations) or to his
particular linguistic phenomenon (noun-noun com-
pounds). Another potential problem is the fact that
web counts are far more noisy than counts obtained
from a well-edited, carefully balanced corpus such
as the BNC. The effect of this noise on the useful-
ness of the web counts is largely unexplored.
The aim of the present paper is to generalize
Grefenstette?s (1998) findings by testing the hypoth-
esis that the web can be employed to obtain frequen-
cies for bigrams that are unseen in a given corpus.
Instead of having a particular task in mind (which
would introduce a sampling bias), we rely on sets of
bigrams that are randomly selected from the corpus.
We use a web-based approach not only for noun-
noun bigrams, but also for adjective-noun and verb-
object bigrams, so as to explore whether this ap-
proach generalizes to different predicate-argument
combinations. We evaluate our web counts in two
different ways: (a) comparison with actual corpus
frequencies, and (b) task-based evaluation (predict-
ing human plausibility judgments).
2 Obtaining Frequencies from the Web
2.1 Sampling Bigrams
Two types of adjective-noun bigrams were used in
the present study: seen bigrams, i.e., bigrams that
occur in a given corpus, and unseen bigrams, i.e.,
bigrams that fail to occur in the corpus. For the
seen adjective-noun bigrams, we used the data of
Lapata et al (1999), who compiled a set of 90 bi-
grams as follows. First, 30 adjectives were randomly
chosen from a lemmatized version of the BNC so
that each adjective had exactly two senses accord-
ing to WordNet (Miller et al, 1990) and was unam-
biguously tagged as ?adjective? 98.6% of the time.
The 30 adjectives ranged in BNC frequency from 1.9
to 49.1 per million. Gsearch (Corley et al, 2001),
a chart parser which detects syntactic patterns in a
tagged corpus by exploiting a user-specified con-
text free grammar and a syntactic query, was used
to extract all nouns occurring in a head-modifier re-
lationship with one of the 30 adjectives. Bigrams in-
volving proper nouns or low-frequency nouns (less
than 10 per million) were discarded. For each ad-
jective, the set of bigrams was divided into three fre-
quency bands based on an equal division of the range
of log-transformed co-occurrence frequencies. Then
one bigram was chosen at random from each band.
Lapata et al (2001) compiled a set of 90 unseen
adjective-noun bigrams using the same 30 adjec-
tives. For each adjective, the Gsearch chunker was
used to compile a list of all nouns that failed to co-
occur in a head-modifier relationship with the adjec-
tive. Proper nouns and low-frequency nouns were
discarded from this list. Then each adjective was
paired with three randomly chosen nouns from its
list of non-co-occurring nouns.
For the present study, we applied the procedure
used by Lapata et al (1999) and Lapata et al (2001)
to noun-noun bigrams and to verb-object bigrams,
creating a set of 90 seen and 90 unseen bigrams for
each type of predicate-argument relationship. More
specifically, 30 nouns and 30 verbs were chosen ac-
cording to the same criteria proposed for the adjec-
tive study (i.e., minimal sense ambiguity and unam-
biguous part of speech). All nouns modifying one of
the 30 nouns were extracted from the BNC using a
heuristic which looks for consecutive pairs of nouns
that are neither preceded nor succeeded by another
noun (Lauer, 1995). Verb-object bigrams for the
30 preselected verbs were obtained from the BNC
using Cass (Abney, 1996), a robust chunk parser de-
signed for the shallow analysis of noisy text. The
parser?s output was post-processed to remove brack-
eting errors and errors in identifying chunk cate-
gories that could potentially result in bigrams whose
members do not stand in a verb-argument relation-
ship (see Lapata (2001) for details on the filtering
process). Only nominal heads were retained from
the objects returned by the parser. As in the adjec-
tive study, noun-noun bigrams and verb-object bi-
grams with proper nouns or low-frequency nouns
(less than 10 per million) were discarded. The sets
of noun-noun and verb-object bigrams were divided
into three frequency bands and one bigram was cho-
sen at random from each band.
The procedure described by Lapata et al (2001)
was followed for creating sets of unseen noun-noun
and verb-object bigrams: for each of noun or verb,
we compiled a list of all nouns with which it failed
to co-occur with in a noun-noun or verb-object bi-
gram in the BNC. Again, Lauer?s (1995) heuristic
and Abney?s (1996) partial parser were used to iden-
tify bigrams, and proper nouns and low-frequency
nouns were excluded. For each noun and verb, three
bigrams were randomly selected from the set of their
non-co-occurring nouns.
Table 1 lists examples for the seen and unseen
noun-noun and verb-object bigrams generated by
this procedure.
2.2 Obtaining Web Counts
Web counts for bigrams were obtained using a sim-
ple heuristic based on queries to the search engines
Altavista and Google. All search terms took into
account the inflectional morphology of nouns and
verbs.
The search terms for verb-object bigrams matched
not only cases in which the object was directly ad-
jacent to the verb (e.g., fulfill obligation), but also
cases where there was an intervening determiner
(e.g., fulfill the/an obligation). The following search
terms were used for adjective-noun, noun-noun, and
verb-object bigrams, respectively:
(1) "A N", where A is the adjective and N is the sin-
gular or plural form of the noun.
(2) "N1 N2" where N1 is the singular form of the
first noun and N2 is the singular or plural form
of the second noun.
(3) "V Det N" where V is the infinitive, singular
present, plural present, past, perfect, or gerund
for of the verb, Det is the determiner the, a or
the empty string, and N is the singular or plural
form of the noun.
Note that all searches were for exact matches, which
means that the search terms were required to be di-
rectly adjacent on the matching page. This is en-
coded using quotation marks to enclose the search
term. All our search terms were in lower case.
For Google, the resulting bigram frequencies
were obtained by adding up the number of pages
that matched the expanded forms of the search terms
in (1), (2), and (3). Altavista returns not only the
number of matches, but also the number of words
adj-noun noun-noun verb-object
Altavista 14 10 16
Google 5 3 5
Table 2: Number of zero counts returned by the
queries to search engines (unseen bigrams)
that match the search term. We used this count, as it
takes multiple matches per page into account, and is
thus likely to produce more accurate frequencies.
The process of obtaining bigram frequencies from
the web can be automated straightforwardly using a
script that generates all the search terms for a given
bigram (from (1)?(3)), issues an Altavista or Google
query for each of the search terms, and then adds
up the resulting number of matches for each bigram.
We applied this process to all the bigrams in our data
set, covering seen and unseen adjective-noun, noun-
noun, and verb-object bigrams, i.e., 540 bigrams in
total.
A small number of bigrams resulted in zero
counts, i.e., they failed to yield any matches in the
web search. Table 2 lists the number of zero bigrams
for both search engines. Note that Google returned
fewer zeros than Altavista, which presumably indi-
cates that it indexes a larger proportion of the web.
We adjusted the zero counts by setting them to one.
This was necessary as all further analyses were car-
ried out on log-transformed frequencies.
Table 3 lists the descriptive statistics for the
bigram counts we obtained using Altavista and
Google.
From these data, we computed the average fac-
tor by which the web counts are larger than the
BNC counts. The results are given in Table 4 and
indicate that the Altavista counts are between 331
and 467 times larger than the BNC counts, while
the Google counts are between 759 and 977 times
larger than the BNC counts. As we know the size
of the BNC (100 million words), we can use these
figures to estimate the number of words on the web:
between 33.1 and 46.7 billion words for Altavista,
and between 75.9 and 97.7 billion words for Google.
These estimates are in the same order of magnitude
as Grefenstette and Nioche?s (2000) estimate that
48.1 billion words of English are available on the
web (based on Altavista counts in February 2000).

3 Evaluation
3.1 Evaluation Against Corpus Frequencies
While the procedure for obtaining web counts de-
scribed in Section 2.2 is very straightforward, it also
has obvious limitations. Most importantly, it is based
on bigrams formed by adjacent words, and fails to
take syntactic variants into account (other than in-
tervening determiners for verb-object bigrams). In
the case of Google, there is also the problem that the
counts are based on the number of matching pages,
not the number of matching words. Finally, there is
the problem that web data is very noisy and unbal-
anced compared to a carefully edited corpus like the
BNC.
Given these limitations, it is necessary to explore
if there is a reliable relationship between web counts
and BNC counts. Once this is assured, we can ex-
plore the usefulness of web counts for overcoming
data sparseness. We carried out a correlation analy-
sis to determine if there is a linear relationship be-
tween the BNC counts and Altavista and Google
counts. The results of this analysis are listed in Ta-
ble 5. All correlation coefficients reported in this pa-
per refer to Pearson?s r and were computed on log-
transformed counts.
A high correlation coefficient was obtained across
the board, ranging from .675 to .822 for Altavista
counts and from .737 to .849 for Google counts.
This indicates that web counts approximate BNC
counts for the three types of bigrams under inves-
tigation, with Google counts slightly outperform-
ing Altavista counts. We conclude that our simple

heuristics (see (1)?(3)) are sufficient to obtain use-
ful frequencies from the web. It seems that the large
amount of data available for web counts outweighs
the associated problems (noisy, unbalanced, etc.).
Note that the highest coefficients were obtained
for adjective-noun bigrams, which probably indi-
cates that this type of predicate-argument relation-
ship is least subject to syntactic variation and thus
least affected by the simplifications of our search
heuristics.
3.2 Task-based Evaluation
Previous work has demonstrated that corpus counts
correlate with human plausibility judgments for
adjective-noun bigrams. This results holds for both
seen bigrams (Lapata et al, 1999) and for unseen
bigrams whose counts were recreated using smooth-
ing techniques (Lapata et al, 2001). Based on these
findings, we decided to evaluate our web counts on
the task of predicting plausibility ratings. If the web
counts for bigrams correlate with plausibility judg-
ments, then this indicates that the counts are valid,
in the sense of being useful for predicting intuitive
plausibility.
Lapata et al (1999) and Lapata et al (2001) col-
lected plausibility ratings for 90 seen and 90 unseen
adjective-noun bigrams (see Section 2.1) using mag-
nitude estimation. Magnitude estimation is an exper-
imental technique standardly used in psychophysics
to measure judgments of sensory stimuli (Stevens,
1975), which Bard et al (1996) and Cowart (1997)
have applied to the elicitation of linguistic judg-
ments. Magnitude estimation requires subjects to
assign numbers to a series of linguistic stimuli in
a proportional fashion. Subjects are first exposed
to a modulus item, which they assign an arbitrary
number. All other stimuli are rated proportional
to the modulus. In the experiments conducted by
Lapata et al (1999) and Lapata et al (2001), native
speakers of English were presented with adjective-
noun bigrams and were asked to rate the degree
of adjective-noun fit proportional to the modulus
item. The resulting judgments were normalized by
dividing them by the modulus value and by log-
transforming them. Lapata et al (1999) report a cor-
relation of .570 between mean plausibility judg-
ments and BNC counts for the seen adjective-
noun bigrams. For unseen adjective-noun bigrams,
Lapata et al (2001) found a correlation of .356 be-
tween mean judgments and frequencies recreated
using class-based smoothing (Resnik, 1993).
In the present study, we used the plausibil-
ity judgments collected by Lapata et al (1999) and
Lapata et al (2001) for adjective-noun bigrams and
conducted additional experiments to obtain noun-
noun and verb-object judgments for the materi-
als described in Section 2.1. We used the same
experimental procedure as the original study (see
Lapata et al (1999) and Lapata et al (2001) for de-
tails). Four experiments were carried out, one each
for seen and unseen noun-noun bigrams, and for
seen and unseen verb-object bigrams. Unlike the
adjective-noun and the noun-noun bigrams, the
verb-object bigrams were not presented to subjects
in isolation, but embedded in a minimal sentence
context involving a proper name as the subject
(e.g., Paul fulfilled the obligation).
The experiments were conducted over the web
using the WebExp software package (Keller et al,
1998). A series of previous studies has shown that
data obtained using WebExp closely replicates re-
sults obtained in a controlled laboratory setting;
this was demonstrated for acceptability judgments
(Keller and Alexopoulou, 2001), co-reference judg-
ments (Keller and Asudeh, 2001), and sentence
completions (Corley and Scheepers, 2002). These
references also provide a detailed discussion of the
WebExp experimental setup.
Table 6 lists the descriptive statistics for all
six judgment experiments: the original experiments
by Lapata et al (1999) and Lapata et al (2001) for
adjective-noun bigrams, and our new ones for noun-
noun and verb-object bigrams.
We used correlation analysis to compare web
counts with plausibility judgments for seen
adjective-noun, noun-noun, and verb-object bi-
grams. Table 7 (top half) lists the correlation
coefficients that were obtained when correlat-
adj-noun bigrams noun-noun bigrams verb-object bigrams

Seen 30 ?.85 .11 ?.13 .22 25 ?.15 .69 .40 .21 27 ?.52 .45 .12 .24
Unseen 41 ?.56 .37 ?.07 .20 25 ?.49 .52 ?.01 .23 21 ?.51 .28 ?.16 .22
Table 6: Descriptive statistics for plausibility judgments (log-transformed); N is the number of subjects used
in each experiment
ing log-transformed web and BNC counts with
log-transformed plausibility judgments.
The results show that both Altavista and Google
counts correlate with plausibility judgments for seen
bigrams. Google slightly outperforms Altavista: the
correlation coefficient for Google ranges from .624
to .693, while for Altavista, it ranges from .638 to
.685. A surprising result is that the web counts con-
sistently achieve a higher correlation with the judg-
ments than the BNC counts, which range from .488
to .569. We carried out a series of one-tailed t-tests
to determine if the differences between the correla-
tion coefficients for the web counts and the corre-
lation coefficients for the BNC counts were signifi-
cant. For the adjective-noun bigrams, the difference
between the BNC coefficient and the Altavista coef-
ficient failed to reach significance (t(87) = 1.46, p >
.05), while the Google coefficient was significantly
higher than the BNC coefficient (t(87) = 1.78, p <
.05). For the noun-noun bigrams, both the Altavista
and the Google coefficients were significantly higher
than the BNC coefficient (t(87) = 2.94, p < .01 and
t(87) = 3.06, p < .01). Also for the verb-object bi-
grams, both the Altavista coefficient and the Google
coefficient were significantly higher than the BNC
coefficient (t(87) = 2.21, p < .05 and t(87) = 2.25,
p < .05). In sum, for all three types of bigrams, the
correlation coefficients achieved with Google were
significantly higher than the ones achieved with the
BNC. For Altavista, the noun-noun and the verb-
object coefficients were higher than the coefficients
obtained from the BNC.
Table 7 (bottom half) lists the correlations co-
efficients obtained by comparing log-transformed
judgments with log-transformed web counts for un-
seen adjective-noun, noun-noun, and verb-object bi-
grams. We observe that the web counts consistently
show a significant correlation with the judgments,
the coefficient ranging from .466 to .588 for Al-

counts. Note that a small number of bigrams pro-
duced zero counts even in our web queries; these fre-
quencies were set to one for the correlation analysis
(see Section 2.2).
To conclude, this evaluation demonstrated that
web counts reliably predict human plausibility judg-
ments, both for seen and for unseen predicate-
argument bigrams. In the case of Google counts
for seen bigrams, we were also able to show that
web counts are a better predictor of human judg-
ments than BNC counts. These results show that our
heuristic method yields useful frequencies; the sim-
plifications we made in obtaining the counts, as well
as the fact that web data are noisy, seem to be out-
weighed by the fact that the web is up to three orders
of magnitude larger than the BNC (see our estimate
in Section 2.2).
4 Conclusions
This paper explored a novel approach to overcoming
data sparseness. If a bigram is unseen in a given cor-
pus, conventional approaches recreate its frequency
using techniques such as back-off, linear interpo-
lation, class-based smoothing or distance-weighted
averaging (see Dagan et al (1999) and Lee (1999)
for overviews). The approach proposed here does
not recreate the missing counts, but instead re-
trieves them from a corpus that is much larger (but
also much more noisy) than any existing corpus: it
launches queries to a search engine in order to deter-
mine how often a bigram occurs on the web.
We systematically investigated the validity of
this approach by using it to obtain frequencies for
predicate-argument bigrams (adjective-noun, noun-
noun, and verb-object bigrams). We first applied
the approach to seen bigrams randomly sampled
from the BNC. We found that the counts obtained
from the web are highly correlated with the counts
obtained from the BNC, which indicates that web
queries can generate frequencies that are compara-
ble to the ones obtained from a balanced, carefully
edited corpus such as the BNC.
Secondly, we performed a tasked-based evalua-
tion that used the web frequencies to predict hu-
man plausibility judgments for predicate-argument
bigrams. The results show that web counts corre-
late reliably with judgments, for all three types of
predicate-argument bigrams tested, both seen and
unseen. For the seen bigrams, we showed that the
web frequencies correlate better with judged plausi-
bility than the BNC frequencies.
To summarize, we have proposed a simple heuris-
tic for obtaining bigram counts from the web. Using
two different types of evaluation, we demonstrated
that this simple heuristic is sufficient to obtain useful
frequency estimates. It seems that the large amount
of data available outweighs the problems associated
with using the web as a corpus (such as the fact that
it is noisy and unbalanced).
In future work, we plan to compare web counts
for unseen bigrams with counts recreated using
standard smoothing algorithms, such as similarity-
based smoothing (Dagan et al, 1999) or class-based
smoothing (Resnik, 1993). If web counts correlate
reliable with smoothed counts, then this provides
further evidence for our claim that the web can be
used to overcome data sparseness.
