Abstract 
We describe a system for the CoNLL-
2005 shared task of Semantic Role Label-
ing.  The system implements a two-layer 
architecture to first identify the arguments 
and then to label them for each predicate.  
The components are implemented as 
SVM classifiers using libSVM.   Features 
were adapted and tuned for the system, 
including a reduced set for the identifier 
classifier.  Experiments were conducted to 
find kernel parameters for the Radial Ba-
sis Function (RBF) kernel.  An algorithm 
was defined to combine the results of the 
argument labeling classifier according to 
the constraints of the argument labeling 
problem. 
1 Introduction and Strategy 
The Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) problem has 
been the topic of the both the CoNLL-2004 and the 
CoNLL-2005 Shared Tasks (Carreras and 
M?rquez, 2005).  The SRL system described here 
depends on a full syntactic parse from the Charniak 
parser, and investigates aspects of using Support 
Vector Machines (SVMs) as the machine learning 
technique for the SRL problem, using the libSVM 
package. 
In common with many other systems, this sys-
tem uses the two-level strategy of first identifying 
which phrases can be arguments to predicates in 
general, and then labeling the arguments according 
to that predicate.  The argument identification 
phase is a binary classifier that decides whether 
each constituent in the full syntax tree of the sen-
tence is a potential argument.  These potential ar-
guments are passed into the argument labeling 
classifier, which uses binary classifiers for each 
label to decide if that label should be given to that 
argument.  A post-processing phase picks the best 
labeling that satisfies the constraints of labeling the 
predicate arguments. 
For overall classification strategy and for 
suggestions of features, we are indebted to the 
work of Pradhan et al(2005) and to the work of 
many authors in both the CoNLL-2004 shared task 
and the similar semantic roles task of Senseval-3.  
We used the results of their experiments with 
features, and worked primarily on features for the 
identifying classifier and with the constraint 
satisfaction problem on the final argument output. 
2 System Description  
2.1 Input Data 
In this system, we chose to use full syntax trees 
from the Charniak parser, as the constituents of 
those trees more accurately represented argument 
phrases in the training data at the time of the data 
release.  Within each sentence, we first map the 
predicate to a constituent in the syntax tree.  In the 
cases that the predicate is not represented by a con-
stituent, we found that these were verb phrases of 
length two or more, where the first word was the 
main verb (carry out, gotten away, served up, etc.).  
In these cases, we used the first word constituent as 
the representation of the predicate, for purposes of 
computing other features that depended on a rela-
tive position in the syntax tree.   
205
We next identify every constituent in the tree as 
a potential argument, and label the training data 
accordingly.  Although approximately 97% of the 
arguments in the training data directly matched 
constituents in the Charniak tree, only 91.3% of the 
arguments in the development set match constitu-
ents.  Examination of the sentences with incorrect 
parses show that almost all of these are due to 
some form of incorrect attachment, e.g. preposi-
tional attachment, of the parser.  Heuristics can be 
derived to correct constituents with quotes, but this 
only affected a small fraction of a percent of the 
incorrect arguments.  Experiments with corrections 
to the punctuation in the Collins parses were also 
unsuccessful in identifying additional constituents.  
Our recall results on the development directory are 
bounded by the 91.3% alignment figure. 
We also did not use the the partial syntax, 
named entities or the verb senses in the 
development data. 
2.2 Learning Components:  SVM classifiers 
For our system, we chose to use libSVM, an open 
source SVM package (Chang and Lin, 2001).   
In the SRL problem, the features are nominal, 
and we followed the standard practice of represent-
ing a nominal feature with n discrete values as n 
binary features.  Many of the features in the SRL 
problem can take on a large number of values, for 
example, the head word of a constituent may take 
on as many values as there are different words pre-
sent in the training set, and these large number of 
features can cause substantial performance issues. 
The libSVM package has several kernel func-
tions available, and we chose to use the radial basis 
functions (RBF).  For the argument labeling prob-
lem, we used the binary classifiers in libSVM, with 
probability estimates of how well the label fits the 
distribution. These are normally combined using 
the ?one-against-one? approach into a multi-class 
classifier.  Instead, we combined the binary classi-
fiers in our own post-processing phase to get a la-
beling satisfying the constraints of the problem. 
2.3 The Identifier Classifier Features 
One aspect of our work was to use fewer features 
for the identifier classifier than the basic feature set 
from (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).  The intuition 
behind the reduction is that whether a constituent 
in the tree is an argument depends primarily on the 
structure and is independent of the lexical items of 
the predicate and headword.  This reduced feature 
set is: 
Phrase Type: The phrase label of the argument. 
Position:  Whether the phrase is before or after 
the predicate. 
Voice:  Whether the predicate is in active or 
passive voice.  Passive voice is recognized if a past 
participle verb is preceded by a form of the verb 
?be? within 3 words. 
Sub-categorization:  The phrase labels of the 
children of the predicate?s parent in the syntax tree. 
Short Path: The path from the parent of the 
argument position in the syntax tree to the parent 
of the predicate. 
The first four features are standard, and the short 
path feature is defined as a shorter version of the 
standard path feature that does not use the 
argument phrase type on one end of the path, nor 
the predicate type on the other end. 
The use of this reduced set of features was 
confirmed experimentally by comparing the effect 
of this reduced feature set on the F-measure of the 
identifier classifier, compared to feature sets that 
also added the predicate, the head word and the 
path features, as normally defined. 
 
 Reduced + Pred + Head + Path 
F-measure 81.51 81.31 72.60 81.19 
Table 1:  Additional features reduce F-measure for the 
identifier classifier. 
2.4 Using the Identifier Classifier for Train-
ing and Testing 
Theoretically, the input for training the identifier 
classifier is that, for each predicate, all constituents 
in the syntax tree are training instances, labeled 
true if it is any argument of that predicate, and 
false otherwise.  However, this leads to too many 
negative (false) instances for the training.  To cor-
rect this, we experimented with two filters for 
negative instances.  The first filter is simply a ran-
dom filter; we randomly select a percentage of ar-
guments for each argument label.  Experiments 
with the percentage showed that 30% yielded the 
best F-measure for the identifier classifier. 
The second filter is based on phrase labels from 
the syntax tree. The intent of this filter was to re-
move one word constituents of a phrase type that 
was never used.  We selected only those phrase 
206
labels whose frequency in the training was higher 
than a threshold.  Experiments showed that the best 
threshold was 0.01, which resulted in approxi-
mately 86% negative training instances. 
However, in the final experimentation, compari-
son of these two filters showed that the random 
filter was best for F-measure results of the identi-
fier classifier. 
The final set of experiments for the identifier 
classifier was to fine tune the RBF kernel training 
parameters, C and gamma.  Although we followed 
the standard grid strategy of finding the best pa-
rameters, unlike the built-in grid program of 
libSVM with its accuracy measure, we judged the  
results based on the more standard F-measure of 
the classifier.  The final values are that C = 2 and 
gamma = 0.125. 
The final result of the identifier classifier trained 
on the first 10 directories of the training set is: 
Precision:  78.27%         Recall:  89.01% 
(F-measure:  83.47) 
Training on more directories did not substan-
tially improve these precision and recall figures. 
2.5   Labeling Classifier Features 
The following is a list of the features used in the 
labeling classifiers.  
Predicate:  The predicate lemma from the 
training file. 
Path:  The syntactic path through the parse tree 
from the argument constituent to the predicate. 
Head Word:  The head word of the argument 
constituent, calculated in the standard way, but 
also stemmed.  Applying stemming reduces the 
number of unique values of this feature 
substantially, 62% in one directory of training data. 
Phrase Type, Position, Voice, and Sub-
categorization:  as in the identifier classifier. 
In addition, we experimented with the following 
features, but did not find that they increased the 
labeling classifier scores. 
Head Word POS:  the part of speech tag of the 
head word of the argument constituent. 
Temporal Cue Words:  These words were 
compiled by hand from ArgM-TMP phrases in the 
training data. 
Governing Category:  The phrase label of the 
parent of the argument. 
Grammatical Rule:  The generalization of the 
subcategorization feature to show the phrase labels 
of the children of the node that is the lowest parent 
of all arguments of the predicate. 
In the case of the temporal cue words, we 
noticed that using our definition of this feature 
increased the number of false positives for the 
ARGM-TMP label; we guess that our temporal cue 
words included too many words that occured in 
other labels.   Due to lack of time, we were not 
able to more fully pursue these features. 
2.6  Using the Labeling Classifier for Train-
ing and Testing 
Our strategy for using the labeling classifier is 
that in the testing, we pass only those arguments to 
the labeling classifier that have been marked as 
true by the identifier classifier.  Therefore, for 
training the labeling classifier, instances were con-
stituents that were given argument labels in the 
training set, i.e. there were no ?null? training ex-
amples. 
For the labeling classifier, we also found the 
best parameters for the RBF kernel of the classi-
fier.  For this, we used the grid program of libSVM 
that uses the multi-class classifier, using the accu-
racy measure to tune the parameters, since this 
combines the precision of the binary classifiers for 
each label.  The final values are that C = 0.5 and 
gamma = 0.5. 
In order to show the contribution of the labeling 
classifier to the entire system, a final test was done 
on the development set, but passing it the correct 
arguments.  We tested this with a labeling classi-
fier trained on 10 directories and one trained on 20 
directories, showing the final F-measure: 
10 directories:  83.27 
20 directories:  84.51 
2.7 Post-processing the classifier labels 
The final part of our system was to use the results 
of the binary classifiers for each argument label to 
produce a final labeling subject to the labeling con-
straints. 
For each predicate, the constraints are:  two con-
stituents cannot have the same argument label, a 
constituent cannot have more than one label, if two 
constituents have (different) labels, they cannot 
have any overlap, and finally, no argument can 
overlap the predicate.

Table 2:  Overall results (top) and detailed results on the

To achieve these constraints, we used the prob-
abilities produced by libSVM for each of the bi-
nary argument label classifiers.  We produced a 
constraint satisfaction module that uses a greedy 
algorithm that uses probabilities from the matrix of 
potential labeling for each constituent and label.  
The algorithm iteratively chooses a label for a node 
with the highest probability and removes any po-
tential labeling that would violate constraints with 
that chosen label.  It continues to choose labels for 
nodes until all probabilities in the matrix are lower 
than a threshold, determined by experiments to be 
.3.  In the future, it is our intent to replace this 
greedy algorithm with a dynamic optimization al-
gorithm. 
3 Experimental Results 
3.1     Final System and Results 
 
The final system used an identifier classifier 
trained on (the first) 10 directories, in approxi-
mately 7 hours, and a labeling classifier trained on 
20 directories, in approximately 23 hours.  Testing 
took approximately 3.3 seconds per sentence. 
As a further test of the final system, we trained 
both the identifier classifier and the labeling classi-
fier on the first 10 directories and used the second 
10 directories as development tests.  Here are some 
of the results, showing the alignment and F-
measure on each directory, compared to 24. 
 
Directory: 12 14 16 18 20 24 
Alignment 95.7 96.1 95.9 96.5 95.9 91.3 
F-measure 80.4 79.6 79.0 80.5 79.7 71.1 
Table 3:  Using additional directories for testing 
 
Finally, we note that we did not correctly antici-
pate the final notation for the predicates in the test 
set for two word verbs.  Our system assumed that 
two word verbs would be given a start and an end, 
whereas the test set gives just the one word predi-
cate.
