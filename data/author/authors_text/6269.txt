ABSTRACT12 
Although with the Semantic Web initiative 
much research on web page semantic annotation 
has already been done by AI researchers, 
linguistic text annotation, including the semantic 
one, was originally developed in Corpus 
Linguistics and its results have been somehow 
neglected by AI. The purpose of the research 
presented in this proposal is to prove that 
integration of results in both fields is not only 
possible, but also highly useful in order to make 
Semantic Web pages more machine-readable. A 
multi-level (possibly multi-purpose and multi-
language) annotation model based on EAGLES 
standards and Ontological Semantics, 
implemented with last generation Semantic Web 
languages (RDF(S)/XML) is being developed to fit 
the needs of both communities; the present paper 
focuses on its semantic level. 
INTRODUCTION 
All of us are by now accustomed to making 
extensive use of the so-called World Wide Web 
(WWW) which we might consider a great source 
of information, accessible through computers but, 
hitherto, only understandable to human beings. In 
its beginning, web pages were hand made, 
intended and oriented to the exchange of 
information among human beings. Due to the 
astonishing growth of Internet use, new 
technologies emerged and, with them, machine-
aided web page generation appeared. Up to that 
point, the structure and the edition of these pages 
fitted only human needs ? and this, only to some 
extent. All of these documents contained a huge 
amount of text, images and even sounds, 
meaningless to a computer. In this way, they put

on the reader the burden of extracting and 
interpreting the relevant information in them. 
Currently, web page presentation in the WWW 
is being handled independently from its content, 
mainly through the use of XML (Bray et al, 
1998) or other resource-oriented languages as 
XOL (Karp et al, 1999), SHOE (Luke et al, 
2000), OML (Kent, 1998), RDF (Lassila et al, 
1999), RDF Schema (Brickley et al, 2000), OIL 
(Horrocks et al, 2000) or DAML+OIL (Horrocks 
et al, 2001). But even though the automatic 
process of information is being eased, the above 
mentioned tasks ? relevant information access, 
extraction and interpretation ? cannot be wholly 
performed by computers yet. Hence, the goal of 
enabling computers to understand the meaning 
(the semantics) of written texts and web pages to 
make it explicit to computers is gaining a growing 
relevance. That is the main pillar sustaining the 
development of what we understand by Semantic 
Web: "the conceptual structuring of the web in an 
explicit machine-readable way" (Berners-Lee et 
al., 1999). In this context, the semantic annotation 
of texts makes meaning explicit, and has become a 
key topic. Thus, great efforts are being devoted to 
the design and application of models and 
formalisms for the semantic annotation of web 
pages to make these documents more machine-
readable. 
Following the guidelines of the Semantic Web 
initiative, much research has already been carried 
out by AI researchers on the semantic annotation 
of web pages (Luke et al, 2000), (Benjamins et 
al., 1999), (Motta et al, 1999), (Staab et al, 
2000). However, these researchers have neglected, 
somehow, the decades of work and the results 
obtained in the field of Corpus Linguistics on 
corpus annotation, not only in the semantic level, 
but also in other linguistic levels. These other 
linguistic levels, whilst not being intrinsically 
semantic, can also add some semantic information 
and help a computer understand a text or, in our 
case, web pages. 
This paper will show the results of our research 
on how linguistic annotation can help computers 
understand the text contained in a document ? a 
Semantic Web document, for example. Special 
efforts are devoted to finding a way of bringing 
together and identifying complementarities 
between the semantic annotation models from AI 
and the annotations proposed by Corpus 
Linguistics. As stated in this paper, far from being 
irreconcilable, they are more than close and may 
be considered complementary. 
This paper is organised as follows: firstly, an 
introduction to the state of the art in text semantic 
annotation in corpus linguistics is presented 
(section 1). Secondly, in section 2, some brief 
notes on the use of ontologies in semantic 
annotation is sketched. Thirdly, in section 3, an 
example of the integration of both paradigms 
(AI?s and Corpus Linguistics?) is presented in the 
scope of our project goals. The main advantages 
of this integration is analysed afterwards ? section 
4 ? and some conclusions are stated ? section 5 ?, 
followed by the acknowledgments section and, 
finally, the references. 
1. TEXT ANNOTATION IN CORPUS 
LINGUISTICS 
The idea of text annotation was originally 
developed in Corpus Linguistics. Traditionally, 
linguists have defined corpus as "a body of 
naturally occurring (authentic) language data 
which can be used as a basis for linguistic 
research" (Leech, 1997). Following McEnery & 
Wilson (2001), Corpus Linguistics was first 
applied to research on language acquisition, to the 
teaching of a second language or to the 
elaboration of descriptive grammars, etc.. With 
the arrival of computers, the number of potential 
studies to which corpora could be applied 
increased exponentially. So, nowadays, the term 
corpus is being applied to "a body of language 
material which exists in electronic form, and 
which may be processed by computer for various 
purposes such as linguistic research and language 
engineering" (Leech, 1997). An annotated 
corpus "may be considered to be a repository of 
linguistic information [...] made explicit through 
concrete annotation" (McEnery & Wilson, 2001). 
The benefit of such an annotation is clear: it 
makes retrieving and analysing information about 
what is contained in the corpus quicker and easier. 
In Leech (1997), a list of the different (possible) 
levels of linguistic annotation can be found. As 
Leech himself states, for the time being, no corpus 
includes all of them, but only two or, at most, 
three of them. Some of them were only in their 
first stage of conception at the time of writing his 
paper. A smaller but more realistic list of 
annotation levels is included in EAGLES (1996a) 
namely: lemma, morpho-syntactic, syntactic, 
semantic and discourse annotation. Standard 
recommendations on morpho-syntactic and 
syntactic annotation of corpora can be found in 
(EAGLES, 1996a) and (EAGLES, 1996b). A 
complementary list of general criteria that should 
be considered when elaborating an annotation 
scheme can be found in one of the results of the 
EAGLES project work, the Corpus Encoding 
Standard (CES, 2000) which are being taken into 
account in the elaboration of our model (Aguado 
de Cea, 2002). With respect to the previous and 
well-known standardization initiative, TEI3, all 
these works mentioned are TEI-compliant. Thus, 
for the sake of brevity, we will focus on semantic 
annotation henceforth. 
As asserted in McEnery & Wilson (2001), two 
broad types of semantic annotation may be 
identified: 
A. The marking of semantic relationships 
between items in the text (for example, the 
agents or patients of particular actions). This 
type of annotation has scarcely begun to be 
applied.  
B. The marking of semantic features of words in 
a text, essentially the annotation of word 
senses in one form or another. This trend has 
quite a longer history but there is no universal 
agreement in semantics about which features 
of words should be annotated4. 
Although some preliminary recommendations 
on lexical semantic encoding have already been 
posited (EAGLES, 1999), no EAGLES semantic 
corpus annotation standard has yet been 
published; nevertheless, for the second type of 
semantic annotation enunciated, a set of reference 
criteria has been proposed by Schmidt and 
                                                     
3 http://etext.virginia.edu/TEI.html 
4 See, for example, the controversies within the SENSEVAL 
initiative meetings ? (Kilgarriff, 1998), (Kilgarriff & Rosenzweig, 
2000). 
 
mentioned in Wilson & Thomas (1997) for 
choosing or devising a corpus semantic field5 
annotation system. These criteria can be 
summarized as follows6:  
1. It should make sense in linguistic or 
psycholinguistic terms.  
2. It should be able to account exhaustively for 
the vocabulary in the corpus, not just for a 
part of it.  
3. It should be sufficiently flexible. 
4. It should operate at an appropriate level of 
granularity (or delicacy of detail). 
5. It should, where appropriate, possess a 
hierarchical structure.  
6. It should conform to a standard, if one exists7. 
2. ONTOLOGIES AND SEMANTIC WEB 
ANNOTATIONS. 
AI researchers have found in ontologies 
(Gruber, 1993), (Guarino et al, 1995), (Studer et 
al., 1998) the ideal knowledge model to formally 
describe web resources and its vocabulary and, 
hence, to make explicit in some way the 
underlying meaning of the concepts included in 
web pages. With Ontological Semantics 
(Niremburg & Raskin, 2001) as a support theory8, 
the annotation of these web resources with 
ontological information should allow intelligent 
access to them, should ease searching and 
browsing within them and should exploit new web 
inference approaches from them. The influential 
WordNet and EuroWordNet (Fellbaum, 2001) 
ontologies should be mentioned as valuable 
resources for this purpose. Many systems and 
projects have been developed towards this aim 
hitherto: SHOE (Luke et al, 2000) proposes 
HTML page semantic annotation with a Horn 
clause-based language also called SHOE; the 
(KA)2 initiative (Benjamins et al, 1999) seeks to 
annotate HTML documents with ontological 
information, taking Knowledge Acquisition 
Community ontologies as a basis; PlanetOnto 
(Motta et al, 1999) aims at automatically 
annotating the HTML news pages of an 
organisation by means of the information obtained 
from an event-ontology based knowledge base; 
finally, within the Semantic Community Web 
Portals project (Staab et al, 2000) an ontology-
based architecture for editing and maintaining 
web portals in an easier way is being developed. 
Besides, a number of semantic annotation tools 
have also been developed so far: COHSE 
(COHSE, 2002), MnM (Vargas-Vera et al, 2001), 
OntoMat-Annotizer (OntoMat, 2002), SHOE 
Knowledge Annotator (SHOE, 2002) and 
AeroDAML (AeroDAML, 2002). 
3. INTEGRATION OF PARADIGMS: AN 
EXAMPLE 
The model here shown, OntoTag, is developed 
within ContentWeb, a Ministry funded project, 
which aims at creating an ontology-based 
platform to enable users to query e-commerce 
applications by using natural language, 
performing the automatic retrieval of information 
from web documents annotated with ontological 
and linguistic information. Besides, a prototype in 
the entertainment domain will be developed. 
ContentWeb objectives can be found in (Aguado 
de Cea, 2002). 
Within the elaboration of OntoTag, a first 
exploration phase has been performed. A short 
example of this first phase is presented next. It has 
been implemented in RDF(S), but an XML 
version was also developed and the possibility of 
using any other language has a priori not been 
discarded. In the annotation example given below, 
two different morpho-syntactic tools were 
applied: Conexor (Conexor, 2002) and MBT 
(MBT, 2002). Some other tools are being 
evaluated for further use and the XML and 
RDF(S) annotation tools and wrappers are being 
designed at the moment. 
                                                     
5 A semantic field (sometimes also called a conceptual field, a 
semantic domain or a lexical domain) is a theoretical construct 
which groups together words that are related by virtue of their 
being connected ? at some level of generality ? with the same 
mental concept (Wilson & Thomas, 1997). 
6  For a more detailed explanation, see (Aguado de Cea, 2002). 
7 Once again the SENSEVAL initiatives must be mentioned: they 
reveal the demand for semantic standardization in the field of word 
sense disambiguation (Kilgarriff, 1998), (Kilgarriff & Rosenzweig, 
2000). 
 8 Ontological Semantics (Niremburg & Raskin, 2001) is a theory of 
meaning in natural language and an approach to natural language 
processing (NLP) which uses a constructed world model ? the 
ontology ? as the central resource for extracting and representing 
meaning of natural language texts, reasoning about knowledge 
derived from texts as well as generating natural language texts 
based on representations of their meaning. 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Morpho-Syntactic Annotation 
Excerpt. 
3.1. RDF(S) EXAMPLE 
DESCRIPTION 
In Figure 1, Figure 2and Figure 3, 
we can see the annotation of the 
following Spanish sentence in the 
first three levels ?Tras cinco a?os de 
espera y despu?s de muchas 
habladur?as, llega a nuestras 
pantallas la pel?cula m?s esperada 
de los ?ltimos tiempos.?9  
In the morpho-syntactic level 
(Figure 1) every word or lexical 
token is given a different Uniform 
Resource Identifier (URI henceforth) 
and three possible categorisations are 
included, according to the three 
different tagsets and systems we 
want to evaluate. Each tagset has 
been assigned a different class in the 
morphAnnot namespace: TradAnnot 
(CRATER tagset), MBTAnnot (MBT 
tagset) and ConstrAnnot (Constraint 
Grammar ? CONEXOR FDG tagset). 
For the sake of space saving, just the 
annotation of the article ?la? has been 
included in the figure. 
In the syntactic level (Figure 2) 
every syntactic relationship between 
morpho-syntactic items is given a new 
URI, so that it can be referenced in 
higher-level relationships or by other 
levels of the annotation model (i.e. 
<synAnnot:Chunk rdf:ID="1_510">). 
Again for the sake of space saving, just 
the annotation of the phrase ?la 
pel?cula m?s esperada de los ?ltimos 
tiempos? has been included in the 
figure. 
In the semantic level (see Figure 3) 
some components of lower level 
annotations are annotated with 
semantic references to the concepts, 
attributes and relationships determined 
by our (domain) ontology, implemented 
in DAML+OIL.

THE XML DATA MODEL 
 our XML data model, every token from the 
ext is labelled with a <Word> tag and a RDF 
specified by the attribute rdf:ID. Immediately 
 nested, a <surface_form> tag will be 
ted, introducing the token as it appeared in 
ource text; then come the morpho-syntactic, 
ctic and semantic annotations for this token. 
e tagset associated to our morpho-syntactic 
 data model (namespace pos) includes the 
 of those three others defined for CRATER10 
panish POS tagset, TEI and EAGLES 
rmant, applied also in SonIsa, the tagger 
oped in our laboratory), MBT (a web-based 
r, also EAGLES conformant) and the web-
 version of CONEXOR FDG parser morpho-
information is annotated by means of an att
lemma, associated to the tag of the name
pos. 
The syntactic counterpart of our XML
model (namespace syn) contains, in a
conformant manner, only the syn
information given by FDG at the moment 
tags may be added as the model is refined)
syntactic information covers EAGLES syn
layers (c) and (d): showing dependency rel
and indicating functional labels. Thus
attributes defined at this level are: depende
which shows the token on which the prese
depends (via its rdf:ID);  dependency, 
describes the kind of dependency between
both and surface_syn_tag, which denote
surface syntactic function of the token 
Constraint Grammar approach. We are
studying the best way to cover EAGLES syn
layers (a) and (b) ? bracketing and labell
segments ? from a Constraint Gra
perspective, not developed in the EA
syntactic guidelines aforementioned.                                               
//arxiv.org/ps/cmp-lg/9406023  
The semantic counterpart of our XML data 
model (namespace sem) is ontology-based and 
defined by means of the tags given in the 
DAML+OIL implementation of our domain 
ontologies. 
4. ADVANTAGES OF THE INTEGRATED 
MODEL 
As shown in the previous section example, it 
seems that AI and Corpus Linguistics, far from 
being irreconcilable, can join together to give 
birth to an integrated annotation model. This 
conjunct annotation scheme would be very useful 
and valuable in the development of the Semantic 
Web and would benefit from the results of both 
disciplines in many ways, not restricted to the 
semantic level, below analysed. A particular 
subsection is dedicated to multi-functionality 
4.1. AT THE SEMANTIC LEVEL 
Let us now see the benefits at the semantic 
level of a hybrid annotation model, first from a 
linguistic point of view and, then, from an 
ontological point of view. 
4.1.1. Regarding ontologies from a linguistic 
point of view 
Taking a closer view to sections 1 and 2, and 
comparing the proposals from both Corpus 
Linguistics and AI, we find out that the use of 
ontologies as a basis for a semantic annotation 
scheme fits perfectly and accomplishes the criteria 
posited by Schmidt. Clearly, its mostly 
hierarchical structure fulfils by itself criterion (5) 
and, as a side effect, criteria (2) and (4), since the 
former is related to the capacity of an ontology to 
grow horizontally (in breadth) and the latter to the 
capacity of an ontology to grow vertically (in 
depth or in specification). Hence, the end user can 
decide the level of specificity needed. Criterion 
(3) is also satisfied by an ontology-based semantic 
annotation scheme, since we can always specialise 
the concepts in the ontology according to specific 
periods, languages, registers and textbases. 
Ontologies are, by definition, consensual and, 
thus, are closer to becoming a standard than many 
other models and formalisms or, as criteria (6) 
requires, at least they lay a framework of 
properties and axioms (principles) and major 
categories that can be modified to some extent to 
fit individual needs. Concerning criterion (1), 
quite a lot of groups developing ontologies are 
characterized by a strong interdisciplinary 
approach that combines Computer Science, 
Linguistics and (sometimes) Philosophy; thus, an 
ontology-based approach should also make sense 
in linguistic terms. 
4.1.2. Regarding linguistic annotations from 
an ontological point of view 
The main drawback for AI researchers to adopt 
a linguistically motivated annotation model would 
lie on the statement in section 1 that says, ?there is 
no universal agreement in semantics about which 
features of words should be annotated? or on that 
other statement in Schmidt?s criterion 1, in the 
same section, that says, ?still an exhaustive set of 
categories is to be determined?. 
But ontology researchers are trying to fill this 
gap with initiatives such as the UNSPSC 
(UNSPSC, 2002) or RosettaNet (RosettaNet, 
2002) in specific domains (i.e. e-commerce). In 
any case, linguistic annotations at the semantic 
level are more ambitious and potentially wider 
than the strictly ontology-based ones. Establishing 
a link between semantic annotation and discourse 
annotation and text construction following the 
RST approach, which has already been applied in 
text generation (Mann & Thomson, 88), seems a 
fairly promising linguistic enhancement. 
So far, we have seen how ontologies can fit in 
the semantic annotation of texts; let us see in the 
next subsections how linguistic annotations in all 
of its levels can improve the potential of Semantic 
Web Pages. 
4.2. MULTI-FUNCTIONALITY 
The need for (shallow) parsing in semantic 
processing is found in Vargas-Vera et al (2001) 
and also in Kietz et al(2000): most information 
extraction systems (as well as other NLP 
applications) use some form of shallow parsing11 
to recognise syntactic constructs or, in other 
words, to syntactically identify some fragments of 
the sentences. A chunker12 called Marmot is 
included in the annotation process presented in the 
                                                     
11 Without generating a complete parse tree for each sentence. Such 
partial parsing has the advantages of greater speed and robustness. 
12 A chunker is a natural language (pre)processing tool that separates 
and segments sentences into its subconstituents, i.e. noun, verb and 
prepositional phrases, etc. 
 
former. Even though this need for lower levels of 
linguistic analysis mentioned hitherto applies to 
information extraction systems, it is not restricted 
to this kind of NLP applications. Since the 
proposed annotation model adds overt linguistic 
information to any kind of document, then it can 
be used for a wide range of purposes that require a 
linguistic or semantic analysis or processing (i.e. 
machine-aided translation, information retrieval, 
etc.). 
5. CONCLUSIONS 
We have seen that, even though AI researchers 
are devoting many efforts to finding an optimal 
model for the semantic annotation of web pages, 
the decades of work and the results obtained in the 
field of Corpus Linguistics on corpus annotation 
have been, somehow, neglected. This paper shows 
the results of the research carried out on how 
linguistic annotation can help computers 
understand the text contained in a document ? a 
Semantic Web page ? bringing together semantic 
annotation models from AI and the annotations 
proposed for every linguistic level from Corpus 
Linguistics. 
The integration of these two approaches 
(Corpus Linguistics and AI) entails many 
advantages for language engineering and AI 
applications. First of all, language resources will 
be more reusable: many of the projects involving 
the use of semantically annotated (web) 
documents must also parse to some extent the 
information and, prior to that, must determine 
somehow the grammatical category associated to 
every word in the document. Introducing the 
annotation of these two levels into the document, 
hence re-using one of the tools already developed 
for this purpose, prevents this whole process of 
document text tokenisation and parsing or 
chunking from being unnecessarily repeated each 
time the document is processed (reusing the 
annotation). Since parsing, for example, is a high 
time-consuming task, we can have an additional 
advantage, that is, reducing our overall Semantic 
Web page processing time. The second main 
advantage is that the meaning of a page with 
explicit semantic annotation can be reinforced by 
the meaning contribution provided by all of the 
linguistic levels; semantic analysis can also 
benefit from the invaluable work done so far on 
the development of ontologies as conceptual and 
consensual models. 
However, the main disadvantage lies in the 
limitations imposed by current technologies: 
obtaining automatically compact, readable and 
verifiable pages is a task hard to be fully specified 
and delimited, but the work being done in our 
laboratory tries to bring some light upon it.
