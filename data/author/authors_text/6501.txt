Abstract 
We propose a dynamic programming 
algorithm for calculaing the similarity 
between two segmeuts of words of the same 
language. The similarity is considered as a 
vector whose coordinates refer to the levels 
of analysis of the segments. This algorithm 
is extremely efficient for retrieving the best 
example in Translation Memory systems. 
The calculus being constructive, it also gives 
the correspondences between the words of 
the two segments. This allows the extension 
of Translation Memory systems towards 
Example-based Machiue Translation. 
\]Introduction 
\[n Translation Memory (TM) or Example-Based 
lVlachine Translation (EBMT) systems, one of 
lhe decisive tasks is to retrieve from the database, 
the example that best approaches the input 
sentence. In Planas (1999) we proposed a two- 
step retriewd procedure, where a rapid and rough 
index-based search gives a short list of example 
candidates, and a refined matching selects the 
best candidates from this list. This procedure 
drastically improves the reusability rate of 
selected examples to 97% at worst, for our 
English-Japanese TM prototype; with the 
classical TM strategy, this rate would constantly 
decline with the number of non matched words. 
It also allows a better ecall rate when searching 
for very similar examples. 
We describe here the Multi-level Similar 
Seglnent Matching (MSSM) algorithm on which 
is based the second step of the above retrieval 
procedure. This algorithm does not only give the 
distance between the input and the example 
source segmeuts, but also indicates which words 
would inatch together. It uses F different levels 
of data (surface words, lemlnas, parts of speech 
(POS), etc.) in a combined and uniform way. 
The computation of the worst case requires 
F*m*(n-m+2) operations, where m and n are 
respectively the lengths of the input and the 
candidate (m<=n). This leads to a linear 
behavior when m and n have similar lengths, 
which is often the case for TM segmentsL 
Furthermore, because this algorithm gives the 
exact matching links (along with the level o1' 
match) between all of the words of the input and 
the candidate sentence, it prepares the transfer 
stage of an evolution of TM that we call Shallow 
Translation. This involves substituting in the 
corresponding translated candidate (stored in the 
melnory), the translation of the substituted 
words, provided that the input and the candidate 
are "similar enough". 
1 Matching Principle 
1.1 The TELA Structure 
The purpose of this algorithm is to match two 
segments of words: input i and candidate C. 
These can each be any sequence of words: 
phrases, sentences, or paragraphs, for example. 
Let us consider input I of length m, not as a 
single segment of surface words, but rather as a 
group of F parallel layered segments r \] 0 <:t<:v) 
each bearing m tokens. Such a structure is shown 
in Figure 1, and we call it a TELA structure z. On 
each layer f, the i-th token corresponds to one of 
the paradigms of the i-th word of input i. in our 
implementation, we use a shallow analyzer that 
gives three paradigms (F=3) for each surface 
I We use this algorithm on a sorted list of ah'cady 
similar sentences, retrieved with the help of an index. 
2 Tile idea o1' this structure is ah'eady in Lafourcade's 
LEAF (1993), and is explained in Planas (1998).

word of the segments: the surface word itself 
(f=l), its lemma (f=2), and its POS tag (f:3). 
Because we do not need a syntactic analyzer, the 
time required for this analysis is not an handicap, 
moreover such parsers are available for lnany 
languages. Let C be a candidate segment of 
length n, for matching input I of length m 
(n>=m). The basic problem involves matching 
f the elements of the set (C i)f<:~:. ~ . .. to those of 
(I~)f<:~: j<=,n- Only three layers are shown in the 
following examples but other types of layers, 
like semantics, or even non linguistic 
information like layout features can be 
considered, as in Planas (1998). Our algorithm is 
written for the general case (F layers). 
1.2 Edit Distance based Similarity 
We consider a match from C to 1 as an edit 
distance process. This edition uses a sequence of 
basic edit operations between the words of the 
segments, like in Wagner & Fisher (1974) who 
used four basic operations: deletion, insertion, 
strict and equal substitution between the letters 
of a word. This approach as also been followed 
by Gale & Church (1993) for their alignment 
algorithm, with six operations. Here, we only 
consider deletions and equalities (i.e. equal 
substitutions): F+I basic operations in totaP. 
One equality corresponds toeach of the F layers, 
and a deletion affects all layers at once. In 
Figure 1, the items in bold match each other, and 
the strikethrough ones have to be deleted. The 
edition of C into I involves five deletions 
("Nikkei", "journal", "reported", that", "really"), 
one equality at layer 1 ("stayed"), two at layer 2 
3 Lepage (1998) also uses deletions and one level of 
equality lbr calculating his "pseudo-distance", for 
getting the similarity between two strings.

("stay", "strong"), and four at layer 3 ("PN", 
"verb", "adj", "noun"). At the Word level, the 
similarity between the two segments is 
considered to be the relative number of words of 
the input segment hat are matched by some 
word of the candidate segmeut in the matching 
zone (from "NTT" to "Monday" in our 
example): 1/4 in Figure 1. The same similarity 
can be considered at different levels. Here, the 
lemma similarity is 2/4, and the POS similarity 
is 4/4. We consider the total similarity as a 
vector involving all layer equalities, plus 
deletions: G(C, 1) = (1/4, 2/4, 4/4, 1-1/4, 1-5/9) 
The fourth coordinate counts the complementary 
proportion of deletions in the "matching zone" of 
the candidate C. The last coordinate counts the 
same proportion, relatively to the whole 
candidate. We take the complement to 1 because, 
the more deletions them am, the smaller the 
similarity becomes. 
When different Ci candidates are possible for 
matching I, the greatest (~(Cio, 1), according to 
common the partial order on vectors, determines 
the best candidate Cio. 
1.3 Matching Strategy 
1.3.1 Basics 
We try to match each word C a of candidate C, to 
a word Ij of input I. Ci inatches lj if one of the 
paradigms of C~ equals one of the paradigms of Ij 
at the same level f, i.e. if Cfi and I\], are equal. 
When a failure to match two words with their 
paradigms Cfi to i~ occurs at a given level f, we 
try to match the words at the next upper level 
f+l: Cmi and Ir+~j. When all of the possible 
layers of the two words have been tried without 
success, we try to match the next word C m to the 
same Ij. If Ci does not match any word of I at any 
622 
level, we consider that it has to be deleted. All 
words of I have to be matched by some word of 
C: no insertion is allowed (see section 1.3.4). 
1'.3.2 Lazy match 
With TM tools, if some useful candidates are 
found, they usually utilize words silnilar to the 
input words because translation memories arc 
applied within very similar documents, most of 
tile time between ancient and newer versions of 
a same document. When tile priority is rapidity 
(rather than non-ambiguity), we can consider 
that a lnatch is reached as soon as a word of C 
and a word of I match at a certain layer f. It is 
not necessary to look at upper levels, for they 
should lnatch because of tile expected similarity 
between tile input and tile candidate. Tile 
previous example illustrates this. As upper levels 
are not tested, this allows a gain in tile number 
of iterations ot' the algorithm. Experiments (see 
Planas (1999)) have confirmed this to be a 
correct strategy for TM. That's why, we consider 
from now on dealing with such a lazy match. 
1.3.3 Exhaustive match 
In the most general case, ambiguity problems 
prevent us fl'om employing the lazy strategy, and 
a correct inatch requires that whenever two items 
CJ~ and I f. match at a certain level f, they should 
J 
match at upper levels. Here is an example:

I PN ~?erb adj" noun 
Figure 2: Lemma ambiguity 
h3 C2, the lemma "stay" of surface word "stay" 
matches tile lemma "stay" of surl'ace word 
"stayed" of I, but they do not match at the POS 
level (noun and verb). Tile algorithm should go 
to this level to find that there is no match. Once 
again, however, because this algorithm has been 
built for TM systems, such alnbiguities hardly 
occur .  
1.3.4 Insertion 
If some items in I are not matched by any iteln 
of C, the match involves an insertion. 
Case of Translation Memories 
If tile candidate sentences are to be used by a 
hmnan translator, s/he will be able to insert the 
missing word at the right place. Accordingly, a 
match with insertion can be used for pure TM. 
Case of Shallow Translation (EBMT) 
in the EBMT system we are targeting, we plan 
to use tile matching sub-string of C for 
adaptation to I without syntactic rules. 
Accordingly, we consider that we do not know 
where to insert the non matching item: in this 
case, we force tile algorithm to stop if an 
insertion is needed for matching C and I. From 
now on, we will follow this position. 
1.3.5 "1)'ace 
We want the output of the algorithm as a list of 
triplets (Cri I f, op)~< i<-. called a "trace", where cri 
J - _ 
corresponds to P; through the "op" operation. We 
note op="f" an cquality at level f, and op="0" a 
deletion. For Example 1, the trace should be: 
(100) (200) (300) (400) (513)  (600) (72  
I) (832) (943) 
2 Adapting Wagner & Fischer, and 
Sellers algorithms 
2.1 Algorithm Principle 
The Wagner & Fischer (W&F) dynamic 
programming algorithm in Figure 3 gives tile 
edit distance between C and I: 
For j=0 to m 
d\[j, 0\]-i//initiating the cohmms 
For i=l to n 
dlO, i\]=i//initiating the rows 
For i= 1 to n 
Forj=l to m 
If(l\[j\]=C\[i\]) {d=d\[i-l, j-1\]}//equality 
Else {d=d\[i-1, j-1\]+l} //subst. 
d\[j,i\]=min(d\[i-1, j\]+l, d\[i, j-1\]+l, d) 
End For 
End For 
Print d\[n, m\] 
Figure 3: The Wagner & Fisher algorithm 
Tile distance is obtained in m*n operations, by 
building an \[re+l, n+l\] array (see Figure 6). Ill 
addition, W&F (1974) proposed a backtracking 
procedure, shown in Figure 4, that scans back 
this array to give a "trace" of the match between 
623 
C and 1 (i.e. it prints the position of the matching 
words), in (m+n) operations. The trace is then 
obtained in (mn+m+n) operations in total. This 
algorithm was previously used in Planas (1998) 
at each layer of a TELA structure to give a trace 
by layer. The data fi'om the traces of the 
different layers were combined afterwards for 
the purposes of TM and EBMT. However, this 
procedure is not optimal for at least two reasons. 
First, the layers are compared in an independent 
way, leading to a waste of time in the case of 
TM, because the lazy match phenomenon is not 
used. Second, the combination of the results was 
processed after the algorithm, and this required a
supplementary process. One can imagine that 
processing the whole data in the flow of the 
instructions of the algorithm is more efficient. 
i= i0; j = m; 
while (i > 0) and (j > 0) 
//del// i f (d \ [ i , j \ ]=d\ [ i - l , j \ ]+ l ){ i= i -1}  
//ins// else if(d\[i,j\]= d\[i, j- l\]+ 1) {j =j -1} 
else//equality orsubstitution 
print (i, j) 
i= i -1 ; j= j - I  
end if 
end while

2.2 Two operation based mininf izat ion 
If we look back at the W&F algorithm, shown in 
Figure 3, the part in bold represents the code 
involved in the calculus of the next local 
distance d\[i, j\]. It testes which of the four basic 
edit operations (deletion, insertion, equal or 
strict substitution) gives the lowest partial 
distance. Nevertheless, we have shown in 
section 1.3.4 that only deletions and equalities

do interest us. We therefore reduce the test in the 
algorithm to that shown in Figure 5. Furthermore, 
we initiate the columns of the array with infinite 
values (huge values in practice) to show that 
initial insertions are not possible, and the rows to 
"0", to count the deletions relatively to iuput I. 
See Sellers (1980) for a due explanation.

Else {d=inf}//big integer, in theory h~finite 
d\[j,i\] = rain (d\[i-1, j\]+l, d)//deletion or equal ? 
Figure 5: Matching with deletions and equalities 
An example of the successive scores calculated 
with this algorithm are shown in Figure 6. The 
total distance (equal to 1) between C and I 
appears in the lowest right cell. 
The fact that only two operations are used 
eradicates the ambiguity that appears in 
selecting the next cell in the W&F algorithm 
backtracking procedure with four operations. In 
our algorithm, either there is an equality (cost 0), 
or a deletion (cost 1). The possibility of having 
the same cost 1 for insertions, deletions, or strict 
substitutions has been eliminated. 
2.3 In t roduc ing  one equal i ty per  level 
As mentioned previously, we need to match 
items at different layers. We introduce here two 
new points to deal with this: 
? In order to keep the score for each equality 
deletion, d\[i,j\] is a vector instead of a 
number: d\[i,j\]=\[scorel ..... scorer, score\]. 
? In this vector, score~ through scor% store 
the number of equalities for each layer f, 
and score records the number of deletions, 
as in W&F (underlined in the arrays).

Figure 7: Introducing a vector of deletion and layer equalities cores 
Figure 7 shows an example of diflbrent score 
vectors involved in a match. To calculate the 
successive d\[id\], we use tile algorithm of Figure 
5 adapted for F levels in Figure 8. 
If(Ir\[j\]=cf\[i\])

d\[j,i\] = max (d~, d,i) //equali O, or deletion 
Figure 8: Adapting the algorithm to F levels 
We first try to get the maxinmm nmnber of 
equalities and then tile mininmm of deletions. 
Each tilne we find a new match in the first 
colunm, we start a new path (see I ~ matching 
with C I, C 4 and C 7 in Figure 7). It' one of the 
vectors of the last column of tile array is such 
that: SUMk=r<=v (scorer) = In ,  there is a matching 
substring of C in which there is a matching word 
for each of the words of I: this constitutes a
solution. In our example, cell (7, 4), with score 
121__0 shows that there is a sub chain of the 
candidate that matches tile input with 1, 2, and 1 
matches at the word, lemma, and POS levels and 
0 deletions. Cell (8, 4) indicates a similar naatch, 
but with 1 deletion Cmorning"). Tile best path 
then ends at cell (7,4). Starting from this cell, we 
can retrieve tile full solution using the W&F 
backtrack algorithm adapted to F levels. 
This approach allows us to choose as compact a
string as possible. When there are several 
possible paths, like in Figure 9, the algorithm is 
able to choose the best matching sub-string. If 
we are looking for a similarity involving first

surface word matches, then lemmas and parts of 
speech, then cell (4,4) of score 2200 will be 
chosen. This strategy can be adapted to 
particular needs: it suffices to change the order 
of the scores in the vectors. 
3 Optimizing 
3.1 Triangularization of the array 
In this algorithm, for each Ij, there must be at 
least one possible matching C~. Hence, in a valid 
path, there are at least m matches. As a match 
between C~ and Ij occurs when "stepping across a 
diagonal", the (m-l) first diagonals (from the 
lower left corner of the array) can not give birth 
to a valid path. Therefore, we do not calculate 
d\[i,j\] across these small diagonals. 
Symmetrically, the small diagonals after the last 
full one (in the upper right corner) cannot give 
birth to a valid path. We then also eliminate 
these (m-l) last diagonals. This gives a reduced 
matrix as shown in the new example in Figure 
10. The computed cells are then situated in a 
parallelogram of dimensions (n-m+l) and m. 
The results is: only m(n-m+l) cells have to be 
computed. Instead of initiating the first row 0 to 
"inf", we initiate the cells of the diagonal just 
before the last full top diagonal (between cell 
(0,1) and cell (3,4)in Figure 10) to "000inf" to 
be sure that no insertion is possible. 
3.2. Complexity 
The worst time complexity of this algorithm is 
F-proportional to the number of cells in the 
computed array, which is ln*(n-m+l). With the 
"lazy" strategy, all F levels are often not visited. 
As the number of cells computed by the W&F 
algorithm is m'n, our algorithm is always more 
rapid. The backtracking algorithm takes m+n 
operations in the W&F algorithm, as well as in 
our algorithm, leading to m(n-m+2)+n 
operations in the MSSM algorithm, and 
m(n+l)+n operations in the W&F algorithm. 
The general complexity is then sub-quadratic. 
When the lengths of both segments to be 
compared are similar (like it often happens in 
TMs), the complexity tends towards linearity. 
The two graphics in Figure 11 show two 
interesting particular cases (ln=n and m running 
from 1 to n=10), comparing W&F and our 
algorithm. For strings of similar lengths, the 
longer they are, the more the MSSM algorithm 
becomes interesting. When n is fixed, the 
MSSM algorithm is more interesting for extreme 
values of the length of I: small and similar to n. 
Conclusions 
The first contribution of this algorithm is to 
provide TM and EBMT systems with a precise 
and quick way to compare segments of words 
with a similarity vector. This leads to an ahnost 
complete radication of noise for the matter of 
retrieving similar sentences in TM systems (97% 
"reusability" in our prototype). The second is to 
offer an unambiguous word to word matching 
through the "trace". This last point opens the 
way to the Shallow Translation paradigm.

algorithm, please refer to Planas (1999). These 
two contributions bring in the main difference 
with relative research 4 concentrating on 
similarity only, represented by a sole integer. 
The TELA structure, that allows the parallel use 
of different layers of analysis (linguistic 
paradigms, but possibly non linguistic 
information) is essential to this work because it 
provides the algorithm with the supplementary 
information classical systems lack. 
The fact that the shallow parser (lemmas, POS) 
is ambiguous or not does not affect significantly 
the performance of the algorithln. If the same 
parser is used for both example and input 
segments, parallel errors compensate each other. 
Of course, these errors do have an influence for 
EBMT: the non ambiguity is then a must. 
A first evaluation of the MSSM speed gives 0.5 
to 2 milliseconds for comparing only s two 
randomly chosen English or Japanese sentences 
over 3 levels (word, lemmas, POS). The

implementation has been done with a DELL 
Optiplex GX 1 233 Mhz, Window NT, Java 1 18. 
This algorithm can be improved in different 
ways. For speed, we can introduce a similarity 
threshold so as not to evaluate the last cells of 
the columns of the computed array as soon as the 
threshold is overtaken. For adaptability, being 
able to deal with a different number of tokens 
according to each layer will allow us to deal 
nicely with compound words. 
In short, if the basis of this matching algorithm 
is the W&F algorithm, other algorithms can be 
adapted similarly to deal with multi-level data.
