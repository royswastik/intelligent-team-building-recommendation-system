Abstract 
Suppose we have a large dictionary of 
strings.  Each entry starts with a figure of 
merit (popularity).  We wish to find the k-
best matches for a substring, s, in a dicti-
noary, dict.  That is,  grep s dict | sort ?n | 
head ?k, but we would like to do this in 
sublinear time.  Example applications: (1) 
web queries with popularities, (2) prod-
ucts with prices and (3) ads with click 
through rates.  This paper proposes a 
novel index, k-best suffix arrays, based on 
ideas borrowed from suffix arrays and kd-
trees.  A standard suffix array sorts the 
suffixes by a single order (lexicographic) 
whereas k-best suffix arrays are sorted by 
two orders (lexicographic and popularity). 
Lookup time is between log N and sqrt N. 
1 Standard Suffix Arrays 
This paper will introduce k-best suffix arrays, 
which are similar to standard suffix arrays (Manber 
and Myers, 1990),  an index that makes it conven-
ient to compute the frequency and location of a 
substring, s, in a long sequence, corpus.  A suffix 
array, suf, is an array of all N suffixes, sorted al-
phabetically.  A suffix, suf[i], also known as a 
semi-infinite string, is a string that starts at position 
j in the corpus and continues to the end of the cor-
pus.  In practical implementations, a suffix is a 4-
byte integer, j.  In this way, an int (constant space) 
denotes a long string (N bytes). 
The make_standard_suf program below creates 
a standard suffix array.  The program starts with a 
corpus, a global variable containing a long string 
of N characters.  The program allocates the suffix 
array suf and initializes it to a vector of N ints (suf-
fixes) ranging from 0 to N?1.  The suffix array is 
sorted by lexicographic order and returned. 
 
int* make_standard_suf () { 
  int N = strlen(corpus); 
  int* suf = (int*)malloc(N * sizeof(int)); 
  for (int i=0; i<N; i++) suf[i] = i; 
  qsort(suf, N, sizeof(int), lexcomp); 
  return suf;} 
 
int lexcomp(int* a, int* b) 
{ return strcmp(corpus + *a, corpus + *b);} 
 
This program is simple to describe (but inefficient, 
at least in theory) because strcmp can take O(N) 
time in the worst case (where the corpus contains 
two copies of an arbitrarily long string).  See 
http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/doug/ssort.c for 
an implementation of the O(N log N) Manber and 
Myers algorithm.  However, in practice, when the 
corpus is a dictionary of relatively short entries 
(such as web queries), the worst case is unlikely to 
come up.  In which case, the simple make_suf pro-
gram above is good enough, and maybe even better 
than the O(N log N) solution. 
1.1 Standard Suffix Array Lookup 
To compute the frequency and locations of a sub-
string s, use a pair of binary searches to find i and 
j, the locations of the first and last suffix in the suf-
fix array that start with s.  Each suffix between i 
and j point to a location of s in the corpus.  The 
frequency is simply: j ? i + 1.   
Here is some simple code.  We show how to 
find the first suffix.  The last suffix is left as an 
exercise.  As above, we ignore the unlikely worst 
17
case (two copies of a long string).  See references 
mentioned above for worst case solutions. 
 
void standard_lookup(char* s, int* suf, int N){ 
  int* i = find_first_suf(s, suf, N); 
  int* j = find_last_suf(s, suf, N); 
  for (int* k=i; k<=j; k++) output(*k);} 
 
int* find_first_suf(char* s, int* suf, int N) { 
  int len = strlen(s); 
  int* high = suf + N; 
  while (suf + 2 < high) { 
    int* mid = suf + (high?suf)/2; 
    int c = strncmp(s, corpus + *mid, len); 
    if (c == 0) high = mid+1; 
    else if (c < 0) high = mid; 
    else suf = mid;}   
  for ( ; suf < high; suf++) 
    if (strncmp(s, corpus + *suf, len) == 0) 
      return suf; 
  return NULL;} // not found 
2 K-Best Suffix Arrays 
K-best suffix arrays are like standard suffix arrays, 
except there are two orders instead of one.  In addi-
tion to lexicographic order, we assume a figure of 
merit, which we will refer to as popularity.  For 
example, the popularity of a string could be its fre-
quency in a search log.  The code below assumes 
that the corpus is a sequence of strings that comes 
pre-sorted by popularity, and then the popularities 
have been stripped off.   These assumptions make 
it very easy to compare two strings by popularity.  
All popcomp has to do is to compare the two posi-
tions in the corpus.1 
The make_kbest_suf program below is similar to 
the make_standard_suf program above except we 
now sort by the two orders at alternating depths in 
the tree.  First we sort lexicographically and then 
we sort by popularity and so on, using a construc-
tion similar to KD-Trees (Bentley, 1975).  The 
code below is simple to describe (though there are 
more efficient implementations that avoid unnec-
essary qsorts). 
 
int* make_kbest_suf () { 
  int N = strlen(corpus); 
  int* suf = (int*)malloc(N * sizeof(int)); 
                                                          
1
 With a little extra book keeping, one can keep a table on the 
side that makes it possible to map back and forth between 
popularity rank and the actual popularity.  This turns out to be 
useful for some applications. 
  for (int i=0; i<N; i++) suf[i]=i; 
  process(suf, suf+N, 0); 
  return suf;} 
 
void process(int* start, int* end, int depth) { 
  int* mid = start + (end ? start)/2; 
  if (end <= start+1) return; 
  qsort(start, end-start, sizeof(int),  
            (depth & 1) ? popcomp : lexcomp); 
  process(start, mid, depth+1); 
  process(mid+1, end, depth+1);} 
 
int popcomp(int* a, int* b) {   
  if (*a > *b) return 1; 
  if (*a < *b) return ?1; 
  return 0;} 
 
2.1 K-Best Suffix Array Lookup 
To find the k-best matches for a particular sub-
string s, we do what we would normally do for 
standard suffix arrays on lexicographic splits.  
However, on popularity splits, we search the more 
popular half first and then we search the less popu-
lar half, if necessary. 
An implementation of kbest-lookup is given be-
low.  D denotes the depth of the search thus far.  
Kbest-lookup is initially called with D of 0.  Pro-
pose maintains a heap of the k-best matches found 
thus far.  Done returns true if its argument is less 
popular than the kth best match found thus far. 
 
void kbest_lookup(char* s, int* suf, int N, int D){ 
  int* mid = suf + N/2; 
  int len = strlen(s); 
 
  if (N==1 && strncmp(s, corpus+*suf, len)==0) 
 propose(*suf);  
  if (N <= 1) return; 
 
  if (D&1) {   // popularity split 
    kbest_lookup(s, suf, mid?suf, D+1); 
    if (done(*mid)) return; 
    if (strncmp(s, corpus + *mid, len) == 0)  
 propose(*mid); 
    kbest_lookup(s, mid+1, (suf+N)?mid?1,  
   D+1);} 
  else {   // lexicographic split 
    int c = strncmp(s, corpus + *mid, len); 
    int n = (suf+N)?mid?1; 
    if (c < 0) kbest_lookup(s, suf, mid-suf, D+1); 
    else if (c > 0) kbest_lookup(s, mid+1, n, D+1); 
    else { kbest_lookup(s, suf, mid-suf, depth+1); 
              propose(*mid); 
              kbest_lookup(s, mid+1, n, D+1); }}}

2.2 A Short Example: To be or not to be 
Suppose we were given the text, ?to be or not to 
be.?  We could then generate the following dic-
tionary with frequencies (popularities). 
 
Popularity Word 
2 to 
2 be 
1 or 
1 not 
 
The dictionary is sorted by popularity.  We treat 
the second column as an N=13 byte corpus (with 
underscores at record boundaries): to_be_or_not_ 
 
Standard  K-Best  
suf corpus + suf[i] suf corpus + suf[i] 
12 _ 2 _be_or_not_ 
2 _be_or_not_ 3 be_or_not_ 
8 _not_ 4 e_or_not_ 
5 _or_not_ 5 _or_not_ 
3 be_or_not_ 8 _not_ 
4 e_or_not_ 12 _ 
9 not_ 9 not_ 
1 o_be_or_not_ 1 o_be_or_not_ 
6 or_not_ 6 or_not_ 
10 ot_ 0 to_be_or_not_ 
7 r_not_ 7 r_not_ 
11 t_ 10 ot_ 
0 to_be_or_not_ 11 t_ 
 
The standard suffix array is the 1st column of the 
table above.  For illustrative convenience, we show 
the corresponding strings in the 2nd column.  Note 
that the 2nd column is sorted lexicographically. 
The k-best suffix array is the 3rd column with the 
corresponding strings in the 4th column.  The first 
split is a lexicographic split at 9 (?not_?).  On both 
sides of that split we have a popularity split at 5 
(?_or_not_?) and 7 (?r_not_?). (Recall that relative 
popularity depends on corpus position.)  Following 
there are 4 lexicographic splits, and so on. 
If k-best lookup were given the query string s = 
?o,? then it would find 1 (o_be_or_not_), 6 
(or_not_) and 10 (ot_) as the best choices (in that 
order).   The first split is a lexicographic split.  All 
the matches are below 9 (not_).  The next split is 
on popularity.  The matches above this split (1&6) 
are as popular as the matches below this split (10).   
It is often desirable to output matching records 
(rather than suffixes).  Records are output in popu-
larity order.  The actual popularity can be output, 
using the side table mentioned in footnote 1: 
 
Popularity Record 
2 to 
1 or 
1 not 
2.3 Time and Space Complexity 
The space requirements are the same for both stan-
dard and k-best suffix arrays.  Both indexes are 
permutations of the same suffixes. 
The time requirements are quite different.  Stan-
dard suffix arrays were designed to find all 
matches, not the k-best.  Standard suffix arrays can 
find all matches in O(log N) time.  However, if we 
attempt to use standard suffix arrays to find the k-
best, something they were not designed to do, then 
it could take a long time to sort through the worst 
case (an embarrassment of riches with lots of 
matches).  When the query matches every string in 
the dictionary, standard suffix arrays do not help us 
find the best matches. K-best suffix arrays were 
designed to handle an embarrassment of riches, 
which is quite common, especially when the sub-
string s is short.  Each popularity split cuts the 
search space in half when there are lots of lexico-
graphic matches. 
The best case for k-best suffix arrays is when the 
popularity splits always work in our favor and we 
never have to search the less popular half.  The 
worst case is when the popularity splits always fail, 
such as when the query string s is not in the corpus. 
In this case, we must always check both the popu-
lar half and the unpopular half at each split, since 
the failure to find a lexicographic match in the first 
tells us nothing about the existence of matches in 
the second. 
Asymptotically, k-best lookup takes between log 
N and sqrt N time.  To see this complexity result, 
let P(N) be the work to process N items starting 
with a popularity splits and let L(N) be the work to 
process N items starting with a lexicographic 
splits.  
Thus, 
19
P(N) = ?L(N/2) + C1 
L(N) = P(N/2) + C2 
 
where ? = 2?p, when p is the probability that the 
popular half contains sufficient matches.  ? lies 
between 1 (best case) and 2 (worst case).  C1 and 
C2 are constants.  Thus, 
 
P(N) = ? P(N/4) + C                                       (1) 
 
where C = C1 + ?C2.   Using the master method 
(Cormen et al 2001), P(N) = O(log2N) in the best 
case (?=1). In the worst case (?=2), P(N) = O(sqrt 
N).  In general, for ? > 1, P(N) = O(N(log2 ?)/2). 
In practical applications, we expect popularity 
splits to work more often than not, and therefore 
we expect the typical case to be closer to the best 
case than the worst case.   
3 Empirical Study 
The plot below shows the k-best lookup time as 
a function of square root of corpus size.  We ex-
tracted sub-corpora from a 150 MB collection of 
8M queries, sorted by popularity, according to the 
logs from Microsoft www.live.com. All experi-
ments were performed on a Pentium 4, 3.2GHz 
dual processor machine with enough memory to 
avoid paging. 
The line of diamonds shows the worst case, 
where we the query string is not in the index.  Note 
that the diamonds fit the regression line quite well, 
confirming the theory in the previous section:  The 
worst case lookup is O(sqrt N).

To simulate a more typical scenario, we con-
structed random samples of queries by popularity, 
represented by squares in the figure.  Note that the 
squares are well below the line, demonstrating that 
these queries are considerably easier than the worst 
case. 
K-best suffix arrays have been used in auto-
complete applications (Church and Thiesson, 
2005).  The triangles with the fastest lookup times 
demonstrate the effectiveness of the index for this 
application.  We started with the random sample 
above, but replaced each query q in the sample 
with a substring of q (of random size). 
4 Conclusion 
A new data structure, k-best suffix arrays, was pro-
posed.  K-best suffix arrays are sorted by two or-
ders, lexicographic and popularity, which make it 
convenient to find the most popular matches, espe-
cially when there are lots of matches.  In many ap-
plications, such as the web, there are often 
embarrassments of riches (lots of matches).  
Lookup time varies from log N to sqrt N, de-
pending on the effectiveness of the popularity 
splits.  In the best case (e.g., very short query 
strings that match nearly everything), the popular-
ity splits work nearly every time and we rarely 
have to search the less popular side of a popularity 
split.  In this case, the time is close to log N.  On 
the other hand, in the worst case (e.g., query 
strings that match nothing), the popularity splits 
never work, and we always have to search both 
sides of a popularity split.  In this case, lookup 
time is sqrt N.  In many cases, popularity splits 
work more often than not, and therefore, perform-
ance is closer to log N than sqrt N.
