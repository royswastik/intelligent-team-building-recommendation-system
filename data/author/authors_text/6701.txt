ABSTRACT
This paper describes a dependency based
tagging scheme  for creating tree banks for
Indian languages.  The scheme has been so
designed that  it is comprehensive,  easy to use
with linear notation and economical in typing
effort.  It is based on Paninian grammatical
model.
1.BACKGROUND
The name AnnCorra, shortened for
"Annotated Corpora", is for an electronic
lexical resource of annotated corpora. The
purpose behind this effort is to fill the
lacuna in such resources for Indian
languages. It will be an important resource
for the development of Indian language
parsers, machine learning of grammars,
lakshancharts (discrimination nets for
sense disambiguation) and a host of other
such tools.
 2. AIMS AND OBJECTIVE
      The aim of the project is to :
- develop a generalised linear
            syntacto- semantic tag scheme  for
            all Indian  languages
- annotate training corpus for all
             Indian  languages
      -     develop parallel tree-banks for all
             Indian languages
To fulfill the above aim - a marathon task
-  a collaborative model has been
concieved. Any collaborative model
implies involvement of several people
with varying levels of expertise. This case,
becomes further complicated as the tag
scheme to be designed has to be equally
efficient for all the Indian languages.
These languages, though quite similar,
are not identical in their syntactic
structures.  Thus the tag scheme demands
the following properties  :-
-  comprehensive enough to capture
   various sysntactic relations across
    languages.
     -  simple enough for anyone, with some
        background in linguistics,  to use.
     -  economical  in typing effort (the
        corpus has to be manually
        annotated).
3. AN ILLUSTRATION
The task can be better understood with the
help of an  illustration. Look at the
following sentence  from Hindi
0:: rAma  ne            moHana   ko
     'Rama'  'ErgPostP'  'Mohan'   'PostP'
      nIlI kitAba dI
     'blue' 'book'  'gave'
   'Rama gave the blue book to Mohan.'
Tree-1 is a representation of the above
verb, argument relationship within the
various constituents of sentence  0 -
                             dI
                 -------------------------
                 |            |                   |
            k1 |        k4|               k2|
                 |            |                   |
      rAma_ne  moHana_ko   kitAba
                                                 |
                                                 |nmod
                                                 |
                                              nIlI
                     Tree-1
Since the input for tagging is a text corpus
and the marking has to be done manually,
the tagging scheme is linearly designed.
Therefore, Sentence 0 will be marked as
follows -
rAma_ne/k1 moHana_ko/k4  [nIlI
'Ram postp'    Mohan postp'    'blue '
kitAba]/k2 dI::v
?book?        'gave'
The markings here represent
-     'di' (?give?) is the verb node
- ?rAma_ne' is  the 'karta' or  'agent'
(k1)
 
    of the verb 'dI',
- 'moHana_ko' is 'sampraadana' or
 
     'beneficiary' (k4) of verb 'dI' (?give?)
- '[nIlI kitAba]' ? (blue book) a noun
phrase - is the  'karma' or 'object' (k2)
of  the verb.
The elements joined by an underscore
represent one unit. Postpositions which
are separated by white space in the written
texts are actually the inflections of the
preceding noun or verb units. Therefore,
they are conjoined.
The modifier-modified elements are
paranthesised within square brackets.
Tags showing the name of the ARC (or
branch) are marked by '/'   immediately
after the constituent they relate to. '/' is
followed by the appropriate tagname.
Thus '/' specifies a relationship of a word
or constituent with another word or
constituent. In this case it is the
relationship of verb 'dI' with the other
elements in the sentence.
Tags denoting a type of node are  marked
by '::'.   '::v' indicates that 'dI' is a verbal
node.
The idea here is to mark only the specific
grammatical information. Certain
DEFAULT CONVENTIONS are left
unmarked. For example, the adjective 'nIlI'
(?blue?) of  'kitAba' (?book) has been left
unmarked in the above example since
normally noun modifiers precede the noun
they modify (adjectives precede nouns).
Such DEFAULT CONVENTIONS save
unnecessary typing effort.
4. GRAMMATICAL MODEL
It was quite natural to use Paninian
grammatical model for sentence analysis
 ( hence the tagnames) because :-
1) Paninian grammatical model is based
 
     on the analysis of an Indian  language
 
     (Sanskrit) it can deal better with the
 
    type of  constructions Indian languages
 
     have.
 
2) The model not only offers a
      mechanism  for SYNTACTIC analysis
      but also incorporates the SEMANTIC
      information (nowadays called
      dependency analysis). Thus making
      the   relationships more transparent.
      (For  details refer Bharati (1995).)
Following tags (most of which are  based
on Paninian grammatical model) have
been used in the above example.
k1 : kartaa (subject or agent)
k2 : karma (object)
k4 : sampradaana (beneficiary)
v  : kriyaa (verb)
Obviously the task is not an easy one.
Standardization of these tags will take
some time. Issues, while deciding the tags,
are many. Some examples are illustrated
below to show the kind of structures
which the linear tagging scheme will have
to deal with.
4.1. Multiple Verb Sentences
To mark the nouns-verb relations with the
above tags in single verb sentences is a
simple task. However, consider the
following sentence with two verbs :-
    1:   rAma ne   khAnA  khAkara
          am' 'postp' 'food'    'having_eaten'
           pAnI    pIyA
           'water'  'drank'
          `Ram drank water after eating the
           food.`
Sentence 1 has more than two verbs - one
non-finite (khAkara) and one finite
(piyA). The finite verb is the main verb.
Noun 'khAnA' is the object of verb
'khAkara', whereas noun 'pAnI' is the
object of verb 'piyA'. 'k2' is the tag for
object relation in our tagging scheme. Co-
indexing becomes the obvious solution for
such multiple relations.   Since there are
two verbs the tagging scheme allows them
to be named as   'i' and 'j' (using notation 'i'
and 'j'). By default 'i' refers to the main
verb and any successive verb by other
characters ('j' in the present case):
 rAma_ne      khAnA   khAkara::vkr:j
  'Ram_postp'  'food'      'having_eaten:j'
   pAnI   piyA::v:i
   'water' 'drank:i'
    This provides the facility to mark every
noun verb relationship.
rAma_ne/k1>i   khAnA/k2>j
khAkara::vkr:j   pAnI/k2>i piyA::v:i
Fortunately, there is no need to mark it so
"heavily". A number of notations can be
left out, and the DEFAULT rules tell us
how to interpret such "abbreviated'
annotation. Thus, for the above sentence,
the following annotation is sufficient and
is completely equivalent to the above :
     rAma_ne/k1   khAnA/k2
khAkara::vkr:j   pAnI/k2   piyA::v
Even though there are two verbs, there is
no need to name the verbs and refer to
them. Two default rules help us achieve
such brevity (without any ambiguity) :
(1) karta or k1 kaaraka always attaches to
 
     the last verb in a  sentence (Thus
 
    'rAma_ne/k1' attaches to the verb at
 
     the   end).
(2) all other kaarakas except k1, attach to
      the nearest verb on the right. Thus
      'khAnA/k2' attaches to 'khAkara' and
      'pAnI/k2' attaches to 'piyA', their
      respective nearest verbs on the right.
4.2. Compound Units
Sometimes two words combine together to
form a unit which has its own demands
and modifiers, not derivable from its parts.
For example, a noun and verb join
together to operate as a single unit,
namely as a verb. In the sentence 'rAma
(Rama) ne (postp) snAna(bath) kiyA
(did)',  'snAna'   and 'kiyA' together stand
for a verb 'snAna+kiyA' (bathed). Such
verbal compounds are like any other verb
having their own kaarakas.This sentence
would be marked as follows :
    rAma_ne/k1   snAna::v+ kiyA::v-
    'Ram_postp'   'bath+'       'did-'
     `Ram took a bath`
A 'v+' or a 'v-' indicates that the word
'snAna' or 'kiyA' are parts of a whole  (a
verb in this case). Taken together they
function as a single verb unit.  Such a
device which may appear to be more
powerful was needed to mark the 'single
unitness' of parts which may appear
separately in a sentence. Thus, the above
notation  allows even distant words to be
treated as a  single compound. Such
occurrences are fairly common in all
Indian languages as illustrated in the
following example from Hindi :
snAna::v+ to        mEMne/k1
 'bath'      'emph'    'I_erg'
subaHa_HI           kara_liyA_thA::v-
'morning_emph'     'had_done'
I had bathed (taken a bath) in the morning
itself.
'+'and ' - ' help in marking this relation
explicitly. (a more detail description of the
notation in 5.1)
4.3. Embedded Sentence
Tags are also designed to mark the
relations within  a complex sentence.
Consider the example below where a
complete sentence (having verb  'piyA'
(drank)) is a kaaraka of the main verb
'kaHA' (said).
moHana    ne        kaHA  ki      {rAma
'Mohan'  'postp' 'said'  'that ' {'Rama'
ne         pAnI     khAnA    khAkara
'postp' 'water' 'food'    'having eaten'
 piyA}.
'drank}
     (Mohan said that Ram drank water
after having eaten the food)
The embedded sentence can be first
marked as follows -
     --------- {rAma_ne/k1 pAnI/k2>j
khAnA/k2 khAkara::vkr piyA::v:j}::s.
The whole embedded sentence is the
'karma'  (object) or k2 of 'piyA' (drank):
The  relation  of the embedded sentence
relation as the object of the main verb is
co-indexed in the following way :-
 moHana_ne        kaHA::v:i      ki
  'Mohan_postp'   'said'             'that'
 rAma_ne/k1     pAnI/k2>j    khAnA/k2
'Rama_postp'         'water'      'food'
khAkara::vkr     piyA::v:j::s/k2>i
'having_eaten'    'drank'
Thus the device of naming the elements
and co-indexing them with their respective
arguments can be used most effectively.
5. TAGGING SCHEME
The tagging scheme contains : notations,
defaults, and  tagsets.
5.1. NOTATION
Certain special symbols such as double
colon,underscore, paranthesis etc. are
introduced first. Two sets of tags have
been provided (to mark the crucial ARC
and node information). However,  apart
from these symbols and tags, some special
notation is required to explicitly mark
certain disjointed, scattered and missing
elements in a sentence. Following
notation is adopted for marking these
elements :-
5.1. 1.   X+ ... X- : disjointed elements
As shown above (4.2),  when a single
lexical unit composed of more  than one
elements is  separated by other intervening
lexical units, its 'oneness' is expressed by
using '+' on the first element in the linear
order and '-' on the second element. '+'
indicates to look ahead for the other part
till you find an element with '-'. '-'
suggests, 'an element marked '+' is left
behind, to which it should get itself
attached'.
    Example - Verb 'snAna_karanA' (to
bathe) in Hindi can occur  disjointedly
 snAna   to         mEMne kiyA_thA
 'bath'     'emph'   'I'          'did'
para    phira     gaMdA   Ho_gayA
'but'    'again'    'dirty'       'became'
 `Bathe I did , but got dirty again.'
'snAna_karanA' is one verb unit in Hindi.
But its two components 'snAna' and
'karanA' can occur separately. Notation
'X+....X-' can capture the 'oneness' of these
two elements. So 'snAna.karanA'
(?bathe?) in the above sentence would be
marked as follows :
 snAna::v+   to         mEMne
    'bath'        'emph'   'I'
 kiyA_thA::v-    para   phira    gaMdA
  'did'                  but'    'again'    'dirty'
 Ho_gayA
 'became'
Another  example of  'scattered elements'
is  'agara .... to' construction of  Hindi.
 agara   tuma    kaHate   to         mEM
   'if'       'you'     'said'      'then'     'I'
A_ jAtA
'would_have_come'
   `Had you asked I would have come'
?agara' and 'to' together give the
'conditionality' sense. Though they never
occur linearly together they have a
'oneness' of meaning. Their dependency
on each other can also be expressed
through 'X+....X-' notation.
 agara::yo+  tuma  kaHto::yo-  mEM A_
jAtA    (tag 'yo' is for conjuncts)
5.1.2.   >i ....:i   : explicitly marked
dependency (:i is the head)
(a)  Example -- The sentence 1a below has
the dependency  structure given in T-2
 1a. phala    rAma     ne
      'fruit'     'Rama' 'Ergpostp'
      naHA_ kara        khAyA
      'having_bathed'    'ate'
    ' Rama ate the fruit after taking a bath'
                                  khAyA
                                     |
                       |----------|-----------------|
                  k1 |       naHA_kara::vkr    |k2
                       |                                     |
                      rAma_ne                     phala
                                   T.2
Default (5.2.5) states that all kaarakas
attach themselves to the nearest available
verb on the right. In (1a) above, the
nearest verb available to 'phala' (fruit) is
'naHA_kara'. However, 'phala' (fruit) is
not the 'k2' of 'naHA_kara'. It is the 'k2' of
the main verb 'khA'. Therefore, an explicit
marking is required to show this
relationship. The notation '>i...:i' makes
this explicit.  Therefore,
           phala/k2>i   rAma_ne   naHA_kara
khAyA::v:i
Where 'khAyA' is the 'head', thus marked
':i' and 'phala' is the dependent element,
thus marked '>i'. An element marked '>i'
always looks for another element marked
':i'.
(b)  Another example of such attachments
which need to be marked explicitly is
given below -
  2a. rAma,     moHana  Ora    shyAma
       'Rama',  'Mohan'    'and'    'Shyama'
Ae
'came'
                                      Ora
                                        |
                          |----------|---------------|
                          |             |                   |
                  rAma      moHana    shyAma
                                T-3
To show their attachment to 'Ora' (and) the
three elements 'rAma','moHana', 'shyAma'
have to be marked (as in 2b.) the
following way in our linear tagging
scheme.
   rAma>i,   moHana>i   Ora::yo:i
shyAma>i
The justification to treat 'Ora' as the head
and show the 'wholeness' of   all the
elements joined by '>i' to ':i' is made
explicit by the following examples-
    rAma,   Ora Haz,       moHana   Ora
     'Rama'  'and''yeah',     'Mohana'  'and'
    shyAma   Ae_ the
    'Shyama'  'had_come'
In this case there is an intervening element
'Ora HAz' (?and_yeah) between 'rAma' and
'moHana' etc. So paranthesis alone will
not resolve the issue of grouping the
constituents of a whole. (By
paranthesising, elements which are not
part of the whole will also be included.)
To avoid this the 'Ora' (and) has to be
treated as a head.
5.1.3.   0    : explicit marking of an ellipted
element (missing  elements).  Example -
     rAma      bAjZAra   gayA,    moHana
     'Rama'     'market'      'went'     'Mohana'
       ghara     Ora   Hari    skUla
       'home'     'and'  'Hari'    'school'
 ?Rama went to the market, Mohana home
and Hari to the school.?
The sentence above has two ellipted
elements. The second and third occurrence
of the verb 'gayA'(?went?). To draw a
complete tree the information of the
missing elements is crucial here.
Arguments 'moHana', 'ghara', 'Hari', and
'skUla' are left without a head, and their
dependency cannot be shown unless we
mark the 'ellipted' element.
 rAma     bAjZAra   gayA,   moHana
 'Rama' 'market'    'went', 'Mohana'
ghara   0  Ora    Hari     skUla 0
'home'      'and'     'Hari'    'school'
In cases where this information can be
retrieved from some other source
(DEFAULT ) it need not be marked. In the
above case it need not be marked.
However, there may be cases where
marking of the missing element is crucial
to show various relationships. In such
cases it has to be marked. Look at the
following example -
eka       Ora       sajjana
'one'      'more'   'gentleman'
kaHate_HEM   bacce        baDZe
 'says'                'children'    'big'
Ho_gaye_ HEM      kisI
'become'                   'nobody'
kI       bAta     naHIM  mAnate
'gen'  'saying'   'not'        'agree'
' One more gentleman says that the kids
have grown older and do not listen to
anybody.'
The above sentence does not have any
explicit 'yojaka(conjunct)', between two
sentences,
        a) bacce baDZe Ho gaye HEM and
            `kids have grown older'
        b) kisI kI bAta naHIM mAnate
             `do not listen to anybody'
Both these sentences together form the
'vAkyakarma(sentential object)' of the
verb 'kaHate HEM' (?say?).
So the analysis would be -
 [eka Ora sajjana]/k1 kaHate_HEM::v:i
  ?one? ?more? ?gentleman? ?says?
{{bacce/k1ud    baDZe/k1vid
    ?children?      ?big?
Ho_gaye_HEM::v}::s {kisI_kI/6
?become?                        ?nobody?_s?
bAta]/k2 naHIM::neg
?words?   ?not?
 mAnate::v}::s}/k2>I
?listen?
It appears to be a neatly tagged sentence.
However, some crucial information is
missing from this analysis. In the sentence
the relationship between the two sentences
within the larger sentential object is not
expressed. The problem now is how to do
it.  Use of '>i...:i' notation can help express
this. However, it needs the ':i' information
and since there is no explicit 'yojaka'
(conjunct) element between the two
sentences it will not be possible to mark it.
The information of the presence of a
'yojaka' (conjunct) which is the head of a
co-ordinate structure is CRUCIAL here.
Without its presence its dependency tree
cannot be drawn. The notation '0' can be
of help in such situations. '0' can be
marked in the appropriate place. This will
allow the tagging of the dependent
elements. Therefore, the revised tagging
would be -
 [eka Ora sajjana]/k1 kaHate_HEM::v:i
{{bacce/k1ud baDZe/k1vid
ho_gaye_HEM::v}::s>j 0::yo:j
{kisI_kI/6  bAta]/k2 naHIM::neg
mAnate::v}::s>j}/k2>i
Here the information of missing conjunct
has been marked by a '0'.
5.2. DEFAULTS
Apart from tagsets and special notations
the scheme also relies on certain defaults.
Defaults have been specified to save
typing by the human annotator. For
example, no sentence has to be marked ba
a sentence tag till it is crucial for the
dependency analysis. For example :
    rAma      ne        yaHa    socA         ki
    'Rama' 'postp' 'this'     'thought'   'that'
     moHana      AegA
    'Mohana' 'would_come'
  `Rama thought that Mohana would come'
This is a complex sentence where the
subordinate sentence is the object
complement of the verb 'socA'(?thought?) .
To indicate the relation of the subordinate
clause with the main verb, it has to
marked.
Similarly,  within the square paranthesis,
right most element is the Head. So there is
no need to mark it. Postpositions's
attachment to the previous noun is also
covered by the default rule. There are
other defaults which take care of modifier-
modified relationships. In short, the
general rules have been accounted for by
defaults and only the specific relations
have to be marked. Elements preceding
the head within paranthesis are to be
accepted as modifiers of the head.
However, In case the number of elements
within paranthesis is more than two (Head
plus two) and one or more of them do not
modify the head then it should be marked.
 Example -   [HalkI    nIlI   kitAba],
                      'light'  'blue'  'book'
Here, 'halkI'(?light?) can qualify both
'nIlI'(?blue?) and 'kitAba'(?book?).  In case
it is modifying 'kitAba'(?book?), say, in
terms of light weight, then it should be left
unmarked. But if it modifies 'nIlI'(?blue?),
in terms of light shade, then it SHOULD
be marked by adding '>' on the right of the
modifying element.
       'halkI'  [HalkI> nIlI  kitAba].
        ?light? [?light?> ?blue? ?book?]
Let us look at another  case where the
dependency has to be explicitly marked.
Participle form 'tA_HuA', in Hindi, can
modify either a noun or a verb. For
example take the Hindi sentence -
   mEMne/k1  dODZate_Hue::vkr
    'I_erg'          'running'
    ghoDZe_ko/k2  dekhA::v
     'horse'                'saw'
This ambiguous sentence may mean either
the following  :-
a) mEMne dODZate_Hue::vkr>i
ghoDZe_ko:i/k2 dekhA ;
     'I saw the horse while the horse was
running'
      Or
b) mEMne dODZate_Hue::vkr>i
ghoDZe_ko/k2 dekhA::v:I
  'While I was running I saw the horse'
There is no need to mark ':i' in sentence
(a). However (b)  will need  explicit
marking.
5.3.TAGSETS
The tagsets used here have been divided
into two categories -
        1) TAGSET-1 - Tags which express
relationships are marked by  a preceding '/'
. For example kaarakas are grammatical
relationships, thus they are marked '/k1',
'/k2', '/k3' etc.
        2) TAGSET-2 - Tags expressing
nodes are marked by  a preceding '::' verbs
etc. are nodes, so they will be marked '::v',
Certain conventions regarding the naming
of the tags are ;
         k = kaaraka, --  all the kaaraka tags
will begin with k-,
                Therefore, k1, k2, k3 etc.
          n = noun
          v = verb  -- eg. v, vkr etc.
6.  CONCLUSIONS
A tagging scheme has been designed to
annotate corpora for various Indian
languages. The objective has been to use
uniform tags for all the Indian languages
thereby evolving a standard which can be
followed for various syntactic analysis for
machine processing. The scheme is yet to
be yet implemented on corpora from
various languages. Some trial workshops
have been conducted to see its
applicability in other Indian languages.
However, once the actual task of tagging
begins one may come across cases which
are not covered by the present scheme.
The idea is to provide a basic scheme
which can later be improved and revised.
