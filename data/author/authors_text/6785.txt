Abstract 
We present a novel system for automatically 
marking up text documents into XML and 
discuss the benefits of XML markup for intel-
ligent information retrieval. The system uses 
the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm to 
arrange XML marked-up documents on a two-
dimensional map so that similar documents 
appear closer to each other.  It then employs 
an inductive learning algorithm C5 to auto-
matically extract and apply markup rules from 
the nearest SOM neighbours of an unmarked 
document.  The system is designed to be adap-
tive, so that once a document is marked-up; its 
behaviour is modified to improve accuracy.  
The automatically marked-up documents are 
again categorized on the Self-Organizing 
Map.   
1 Introduction 
Vast amounts of information are now available in elec-
tronic form to which accurate and speedy access is get-
ting more difficult.  The increasing quantity of 
information has created a need for intelligent manage-
ment and retrieval techniques. Many of the existing in-
formation retrieval systems, which deal with large 
volumes of documents, have poor retrieval performance 
because these systems can use a little knowledge in the 
documents.  By adopting XML as a standard document 
format, content-based queries can be performed by ex-
ploiting the XML structure of the documents. In addi-
tion, specifically tagged sections of the documents can 
be searched rather than the entire document, thus pro-
viding fast and effective retrieval.  Furthermore, using 
the logical structure of a document created by  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
XML markup, different types of operations can be per-
formed, for example, the same content can be reused in 
a variety of formats, specific elements can be extracted 
from the XML documents and full documents satisfying 
certain structural conditions can be retrieved from the 
database. These and other advantages of using XML 
make it a complete solution for content management 
and intelligent information retrieval. However, despite 
the advantages and the popularity of XML, we still do 
not have large repositories of XML because automatic 
XML markup is still a challenge and the process of 
manually marking up XML documents is complex, te-
dious and expensive. Most of the existing automatic 
markup systems are limited to certain domains and do 
not perform general automatic markup. In addressing 
the need for more general automatic markup of text 
documents, we present a system with a novel hybrid 
architecture.  The system uses the techniques of Self-
Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm (Kohonen, 1997) and 
an inductive learning algorithm, C5 (Quinlan, 1993, 
2000).   
 
2 System overview 
The system has two phases.  The first phase of the sys-
tem deals with the formation of a map of valid XML (a 
valid XML document is one which is well-formed and 
which has been validated against a DTD) marked-up 
documents using the SOM algorithm. The second phase 
deals with the automatic markup of new (unmarked) 
document according to the markup of existing docu-
ments.  Once a document is marked-up, the system?s 
behaviour is modified to improve accuracy.  These two 
phases of the system are currently implemented inde-
pendently but will be combined to form an integrated 
  
hybrid system.  This paper focuses on phase 2 of the 
system. 
 
 Phase 2 of the system is implemented as an independ-
ent automatic XML markup system, which is Figure 1. 
It comprises two main modules ? a Rule extraction 
module and a Markup module.  The rule extraction 
module deals with the extraction of rules using an in-
ductive learning approach (Mitchell, 1997).  Firstly, 
during a preliminary phase, training examples are col-
lected from the valid XML marked-up documents.  
These documents should be from a specific domain and 
their markup should be valid and conformant to the 
rules of a single Document Type Definition (DTD).  An 
XML document consists of a strictly nested hierarchy of 
elements with a root element.  Only elements having 
text nodes are considered as markup elements for our 
system.  
  
 
  
 
Figure 3: Automatic XML markup system 
 
The markup of elements nested within other elements 
can be accomplished by using the DTD.  Each training 
instance corresponds to an element containing a text 
node from the collection of marked-up documents.  The 
text enclosed between the start and end tags of all occur-
rences of each element is encoded using a fixed-width 
feature vector.  We have used 31 features in our ex-
periments.  The set of feature vectors is used by the sys-
tem to learn classifiers.  An inductive learning algorithm 
processes these encoded instances to develop classifiers 
for elements having specific tag names. These classifi-
ers segment the text of an unmarked document into dif-
ferent elements of the resulting XML marked-up 
document.  In our system, the C5 program is used to 
learn classifiers. These classifiers are later used to 
markup the segments of text as XML elements. 
 
The second module deals with the creation of XML 
markup.  The unmarked document to be used for this 
process should be from the same domain and should 
have a similar structure to the documents, which were 
used for learning the rules.  To accomplish the markup, 
the unmarked document is segmented into pieces of text 
using a variety of heuristics.  These heuristics are de-
rived from the set of training examples.  By using the 
DTD conformant to the document set used for learning 
the rules and by using the text segments stored for each 
element, a hierarchical structure of the document is en-
coded and the marked-up document is produced. 
 
The markup produced by the system can be validated 
according to a DTD.  However, in order to check the 
accuracy of the markup, we have to examine it manually 
and compare it with the original source (if available) as 
XML processors can only validate the syntax of the 
markup, and not its semantics. 
 
3 Performance 
We used documents from a number of different domains 
for our experiments, including letters from the Mac-
Greevy archive (Schreibman, 1998, 2000), a database of 
employee records, Shakespearean plays (Bosak, 1998), 
poems from an early American encoding project, and 
scientific journal articles (Openly Informatics, Inc., 
1999-200). Figure 2 shows a part of a scene from ?A 
Midsummer Night's Dream? as an example of XML 
markup automatically produced by our system. The 
underlined text was not marked up by our system. 
 
We have also evaluated our system with some of the 
document sets. For evaluation, we considered the ele-
ments representing the content of the document, and a 
human expert is required to evaluate this. We have used 
three performance measures in evaluating the automatic 
markup process.  These measures are 
? The percentage of markup elements determined 
correctly by the system  
? The percentage of markup elements determined 
incorrectly by the system  
? The percentage of markup elements not deter-
mined by the system (i.e. text nodes for these 
markup elements are not present in the marked-
up document produced by the system) 
 
The elements of 10 valid XML marked-up letters from 
the MacGreevy archive were used to learn C5 rules and 
text segmentation heuristics. By applying these rules 
and heuristics, 55 elements of five unmarked letters 
  
from the MacGreevy archive were automatically 
marked up by the system with 96% accuracy (we use 
the term  ?accuracy? here to mean the number of 
marked-up elements correctly determined by the sys-
tem).  Similarly, elements of 5 valid XML marked-up 
Shakespeare plays were used as training examples and 
13882 elements of four Shakespearean plays were 
automatically marked-up by the system. In this case the 
accuracy rate was 92%.

4 Conclusion 
We have described a system with a novel hybrid archi-
tecture that uses an inductive learning approach to per-
form automatic markup of text documents.  The system 
automatically marks up documents by capturing markup 
information from the neighbouring documents on a 
Self-Organizing Map.  Such marked-up documents can 
be used for management and retrieval purposes accord-
ing to the structural information they contain.  The re-
sults from our experiments demonstrate that our 
approach is practical and that our system provides a 
novel approach for automatically marking up text 
documents in XML.  The functionality of our system 
makes it a useful tool for electronic information ex-
change.
