Abstract
The DLSI-UA team is currently working on sev-
eral word sense disambiguation approaches, both
supervised and unsupervised. These approaches are
based on different ways to use both annotated and
unannotated data, and several resources generated
from or exploiting WordNet (Miller et al, 1993),
WordNet Domains, EuroWordNet (EWN) and addi-
tional corpora. This paper presents a view of differ-
ent system results for Word Sense Disambiguation
in different tasks of SENSEVAL-3.
1 Introduction
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is an open re-
search field in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
The task of WSD consists in assigning the correct
sense to words in a particular context using an elec-
tronic dictionary as the source of words definitions.
This is a difficult problem that is receiving a great
deal of attention from the research community.
At the Second International Workshop on
Evaluating Word Sense Disambiguation Systems,
SENSEVAL-2, several supervised and unsupervised
systems took part. The more successful systems re-
lay on corpus-based and supervised learning meth-
ods. At SENSEVAL-2 the average level of accu-
racy achieved rounded 70%, which is insufficient
for such other NLP tasks as information retrieval,
machine translation, or question answering.
The DLSI-UA systems were applied to three
SENSEVAL-3 tasks: English all-words, English lex-
ical sample and Spanish Lexical Sample. Our sys-
tems use both corpus-based and knowledge-based
approaches: Maximum Entropy(ME) (Lau et al,
1993; Berger et al, 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1998) is
a corpus-based and supervised method based on
linguistic features; ME is the core of a bootstrap-
ping algorithm that we call re-training inspired
? This paper has been partially supported by the Spanish
Government (CICyT) under project number TIC-2003-7180
and the Valencia Government (OCyT) under project number
CTIDIB-2002-151
by co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998); Rele-
vant Domains (RD) (Montoyo et al, 2003) is a
resource built from WordNet Domains (Magnini
and Cavaglia, 2000) that is used in an unsuper-
vised method that assigns domain and sense la-
bels; Specification Marks(SP) (Montoyo and Palo-
mar, 2000) exploits the relations between synsets
stored in WordNet (Miller et al, 1993) and does not
need any training corpora; Commutative Test (CT)
(Nica et al, 2003), based on the Sense Discrimi-
nators device derived from EWN (Vossen, 1998),
disambiguates nouns inside their syntactic patterns,
with the help of information extracted from raw cor-
pus.

in which SENSEVAL-3 tasks is shown in Table 1.

Table 1: DLSI-UA Systems at SENSEVAL-3
Most of these methods are relatively new and our
goal when participating at SENSEVAL-3 is to evalu-
ate for the first time such approaches. At the mo-
ment of writing this paper we can conclude that
these are promising contributions in order to im-
prove current WSD systems.
In the following section each method is described
briefly. Then, details of how the SENSEVAL-3 train
and testing data were processed are shown. Next,
the scores obtained by each system are explained.
Finally, some conclusions and future work are pre-
sented.

2 Methods and Algorithms
In this section we describe the set of methods and
techniques that we used to build the four systems
that had participated in SENSEVAL-3.
2.1 Re-training and Maximum Entropy
In this section, we describe our bootstrapping
method, which we call re-training. Our method
is derived from the co-training method. Our re-
training system is based on two different views of
the data (as is also the case for co-training), de-
fined using several groups of features from those de-
scribed in Figure 1, with several filters that ensure a
high confidence sense labelling.
? the target word itself
? lemmas of content-words at positions ?1, ?2, ?3
? words at positions ?1, ?2,
? words at positions ?1, ?2, ?3
? content-words at positions ?1, ?2, ?3
? POS-tags of words at positions ?1, ?2, ?3
? lemmas of collocations at positions (?2,?1),
(?1,+1), (+1,+2)
? collocations at positions (?2,?1), (?1,+1),
(+1,+2)
? lemmas of nouns at any position in context, occur-
ring at least m% times with a sense
? grammatical relation of the target word
? the word that the target word depends on
? the verb that the target word depends on
? the target word belongs to a multi-word, as identi-
fied by the parser
? ANPA codes (Spanish only)
? IPTC codes (Spanish only)
Figure 1: Features Used for the Supervised Learn-
ing
These two views consist of two weak ME learn-
ers, based on different sets of linguistic features,
for every possible sense of a target word. We de-
cided to use ME as the core of our bootstrapping
method because it has shown to be competitive in
WSD when compared to other machine learning ap-
proaches (Sua?rez and Palomar, 2002; Ma`rquez et
al., 2003).
The main difference with respect co-training is
that the two views are used in parallel in order to
get a consensus of what label to assign to a particu-
lar context. Additional filters will ultimately deter-
mine which contexts will then be added to the next
training cycle.
Re-training performs several binary partial train-
ings with positive and negative examples for each
sense. These classifications must be merged in a
unique label for such contexts with enough evidence
of being successfully classified. This ?evidence? re-
lies on values of probability assigned by the ME
module to positive and negative labels, and the fact
that the unlabeled example is classified as positive
for a unique sense only. The set of new labeled ex-
amples feeds the training corpora of the next itera-
tion with positive and negative examples. The stop-
ping criteria is a certain number of iterations or the
failure to obtain new examples from the unlabeled
corpus.
2.2 Specification Marks
Specification Marks is an unsupervised WSD
method over nouns. Its context is the group of words
that co-occur with the word to be disambiguated in
the sentence and their relationship to the noun to
be disambiguated. The disambiguation is resolved
with the use of the WordNet lexical knowledge base.
The underlying hypothesis of the method we
present here is that the higher the similarity between
two words, the larger the amount of information
shared by two concepts. In this case, the informa-
tion commonly shared by two concepts is indicated
by the most specific concept that subsumes them
both in the taxonomy.
The input for the WSD module is a group of
nouns W = {w1, w2, ..., wn} in a context. Each
word wi is sought in WordNet, each having an asso-
ciated set of possible senses Si ={Si1, Si2, ..., Sin},
and each sense having a set of concepts in the IS-A
taxonomy (hypernymy/hyponymy relations). First,
the common concept to all the senses of the words
that form the context is gathered. This concept is
marked by the initial specification mark (ISM). If
this initial specification mark does not resolve the
ambiguity of the word, we then descend through
the WordNet hierarchy, from one level to another,
assigning new specification marks. The number of
concepts contained within the subhierarchy is then
counted for each specification mark. The sense that
corresponds to the specification mark with the high-
est number of words is the one chosen as the sense
disambiguated within the given context
We define six heuristics for our system: Heuris-
tic of Hypernym, Heuristic of Definition, Heuristic
of Common Specification Mark, Heuristic of Gloss
Hypernym, Heuristic of Hyponym and Heuristic of
Gloss Hyponym.
2.3 Relevant Domains
This is an unsupervised WSD method based on the
WordNet Domains lexical resource (Magnini and
Cavaglia, 2000). The underlying working hypoth-
esis is that domain labels, such as ARCHITEC-
TURE, SPORT and MEDICINE provide a natural
way to establish semantic relations between word
senses, that can be used during the disambiguation
process. This resource has already been used on
Word Sense Disambiguation (Magnini and Strappa-
rava, 2000), but it has not made use of glosses infor-
mation. So our approach make use of a new lexical
resource obtained from glosses information named
Relevant Domains.
First step is to obtain the Relevant Domains re-
source from WordNet glosses. For this task is nec-
essary a previous part-of-speech tagging of Word-
Net glosses (each gloss has associated a domain la-
bel). So we extract all nouns, verbs, adjectives and
adverbs from glosses and assign them their associ-
ated domain label. With this information and using
the Association Ratio formula (w=word,D=domain
label), in (1), we obtain the Relevant Domains re-
source.
AR(w,D) = Pr(w|D)log2Pr(w|D)Pr(w) (1)
The final result is for each word, a set of domain
labels sorted by Association Ratio, for example,
for word plant? its Relevant Domains are: genetics
0.177515, ecology 0.050065, botany 0.038544 . . . .
Once obtained Relevant Domains the disam-
biguation process is carried out. We obtain from
the text source the context words that co-occur with
the word to be disambiguated (context could be
a sentence or a window of words). We obtain a
context vector from Relevant Domains and context
words (in case of repeated domain labels, they are
weighted). Furthermore we need a sense vector ob-
tained in the same way as context vector from words
of glosses of each word sense. We select the cor-
rect sense using the cosine measure between con-
text vector and sense vectors. So the selected sense
is that for which the cosine with the context vector
is closer to one.
2.4 Pattern-Nica
This is an unsupervised method only for Spanish
nouns exploiting both EuroWordNet and corpus.
In this method we adopt a different approach to
WSD: the occurrence to be disambiguated is con-
sidered not separately, but integrated into a syn-
tactic pattern, and its disambiguation is carried
out in relation to this pattern. A syntactic pat-
tern is a triplet X-R-Y, formed by two lexical con-
tent units X and Y and an eventual relational el-
ement R, which corresponds to a syntactic rela-
tion between X and Y. Examples: [X=canal-noun
R=de-preposition Y=televisio?n-noun], [X=pasaje-
noun R=? Y=ae?reo-adjective]. The strategy is
based on the hypothesis that syntactic patterns in
which an ambiguous occurrence participates have
decisive influence on its meaning. We also assume
that inside a syntactic pattern a word will tend to
have the same sense: the ?quasi one sense per syn-
tactic pattern? hypothesis. The method works as fol-
lows:
Step 1, the identification of the syntactic patterns
of the ambiguous occurrence;
Step 2, the extraction of information related to it:
from corpus and from the sentential context;
Step 3, the application of the WSD algorithm on
the different information previously obtained;
Step 4, the final sense assignment by combining
the partial sense proposals from step 3.
For step 1, we POS-tag the test sentence and ex-
tract the sequences that correspond to previously de-
fined combinations of POS tags. We only kept the
patterns with frequency 5 or superior.
In step 2, we use a search corpus previously POS-
tagged. For every syntactic pattern of the ambigu-
ous occurrence X, we obtain from corpus two sets of
words: the substitutes of X into the pattern (S1) and
the nouns that co-occur with the pattern in any sen-
tence from the corpus (S2), In both cases, we keep
only the element with frequency 5 or superior.
We perform step 3 by means of the heuristics de-
fined by the Commutative Test (CT) algorithm ap-
plied on each set from 2. The algorithm is related
to the Sense Discriminators (SD) lexical device, an
adaptation of the Spanish WordNet, consisting in a
set of sense discriminators for every sense of a given
noun in WordNet. The Commutative Test algorithm
lays on the hypothesis that if an ambiguous occur-
rence can be substituted in a syntactic pattern by a
sense discriminator, then it can have the sense cor-
responding to that sense discriminator.
For step 4, we first obtain a sense assignment in
relation with each syntactic pattern, by intersecting
the sense proposals from the two heuristics corre-
sponding to a pattern; then we choose the most fre-
quent sense between those proposed by the differ-
ent syntactic patterns; finally, if there are more final
proposed senses, we choose the most frequent sense
on the base of sense numbers in WordNet.
The method we propose for nouns requires only a
large corpus, a minimal preprocessing phase (POS-
tagging) and very little grammatical knowledge, so
it can easily be adapted to other languages. Sense
assignment is performed exploiting information ex-
tracted from corpus, thus we make an intensive use
of sense untagged corpora for the disambiguation
process.
3 Tasks Processing
At this point we explain for each task the systems
processing. The results of each system are shown in
Table2:
DLSI-UA Systems Precision Recall
LS-SPA-SU 84% 84%
LS-ENG-SU 82% 32%
ALL-NOSU 34% 28%
LS-ENG-NOSU 32% 20%
LS-SPA-NOSU 62% 62%
LS-SPA-PATTERN 84% 47%
Table 2: Results at SENSEVAL-3
3.1 DLSI-UA-LS-SPA-SU
Our system, based on re-training and maximum en-
tropy methods, processed both sense labelled and
unlabelled Spanish Lexical Sample data in three
consecutive steps:
Step 1, analyzing the train corpus: words which
most frequent sense is under 70% were selected.
For each one of these words, each feature was used
in a 3-fold cross-validation in order to determine the
best set of features for re-training.
Step 2, feeding training corpora: for these se-
lected words, based on the results of the previous
step, each training corpus was enriched with new
examples from the unlabelled data using re-training.
Step 3, classifying the test data: for the selected
words, re-training was used again to obtain a first set
of answers with, a priori, a label with a high level of
confidence; the remaining contexts that re-training
could not classify were processed with the ME sys-
tem using a unique set of features for all words.
The lemmatization and POS information supplied
into the SENSEVAL-3 Spanish data were the infor-
mation used for defining the features of the system.
0ur system obtained an accuracy of 0.84 for the
Spanish lexical sample task. Unfortunately, a shal-
low analysis of the answers revealed that the UA.5
system performed slightly worse than if only the ba-
sic ME system were used1. This fact means that the
new examples extracted from the unlabelled data in-
troduced too much noise into the classifiers. Be-
cause this anomalous behavior was present only on
some words, a complete study of such new exam-
ples must be done. Probably, the number of itera-
tions done by re-training over unlabelled data were
too low and the enrichment of the training corpora
not large enough.
1The ME system, without using re-training, has not com-
peted at SENSEVAL-3: our own scoring of these set of answers
reported an accuracy of 0.856
3.2 DLSI-UA-LS-ENG-SU
In the English Lexical Sample task our system goal
was to prove that the re-training method ensures a
high level of precision.
By means of a 3-fold cross-validation of the train
data, the features were ordered from higher to lower
precision. Based on this information, four execu-
tions of re-training over the test data were done with
different selections of features for the two views of
the method. Each execution feed the learning cor-
pora of the next one with new examples, those that
re-training considered as the most probably correct.
For this system Minipar parser (Lin, 1998)was
used to properly add syntactic information to the
training and testing data.
Almost 40% of the test contexts were la-
belled by our system, obtaining these scores (for
?fine-grained? and ?coarse-grained?, respectively):
0.782/0.828 precision and 0.310/0.329 recall. In our
opinion, such results must be interpreted as very
positive because the re-training method is able to
satisfy a high level of precision if the parameters of
the system are correctly set.
3.3 DLSI-UA-ALL-NOSU and
DLSI-UA-LS-ENG-NOSU
In the English All Words and English Lexical Sam-
ple tasks RD system was performed with informa-
tion obtained from Relevant Domains resource us-
ing for the disambiguation process all the 165 do-
main labels.
For All Words task we used as input information
all nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs present in
a 100 words window around the word to be disam-
biguated. So our system obtained a 34% of preci-
sion and a reduced recall around 28%.
For Lexical Sample task we used all nouns, verbs,
adjectives and adverbs present in the context of each
instance obtaining around 32% precision.
We obtained a reduced precision due to we use all
the domains label hierarchy. In some experiments
realized on SENSEVAL-2 data, our system obtained
a more high precision when grouping domains into
the first three levels. Therefore we expect with re-
ducing the number of domains labels, an improve-
ment on precision.
3.4 DLSI-UA-LS-SPA-NOSU
We used a combined system for Spanish Lexical
Sample task, using the SM method for disambiguat-
ing nouns and the ME method for disambiguating
verbs and adjectives. We obtained around 62% pre-
cision and a 62% recall.
3.5 DLSI-UA-LS-SPA-PATTERN
Our goal when participating in this task was to
demonstrate that the applying of syntactic patterns
to WSD maintains high levels of precision.
In this task we used also a combined system for
Spanish Lexical Sample task, using Pattern-Nica
method for disambiguating nouns and ME method
for disambiguating verbs and adjectives. We ob-
tained around 84% precision and a 47% recall.
4 Conclusions
The supervised systems for the English and Span-
ish lexical sample tasks are very competitive. Al-
though the processing of the train and test data was
different for each task, both systems rely on re-
training, a bootstrapping method, that uses a max-
imum entropy-based WSD module.
The results for the English task prove that re-
training is capable of maintaining a high level of
precision. Nevertheless, for the Spanish task, al-
though the scores achieved were excellent, the sys-
tem must be redesigned in order to improve the clas-
sifiers.
The re-training method is a proposal that we are
trying to incorporate into text retrieval and ques-
tion answering systems that could take advantage of
sense disambiguation of a subset of words.
The unsupervised systems presented here does
not appear to be sufficient for a stand-alone WSD
solution. Wether these methods can be combined
with other supervised methods to improve their re-
sults requires further investigation.

Abstract
The R2D2 systems for the English All-Words and
Lexical Sample tasks at SENSEVAL-3 are based on
several supervised and unsupervised methods com-
bined by means of a voting procedure. Main goal
was to take advantage of training data when avail-
able, and getting maximum coverage with the help
of methods that not need such learning examples.
The results reported in this paper show that super-
vised and unsupervised methods working in par-
allel, and a simple sequence of preferences when
comparing the answers of such methods, is a feasi-
ble method. . .
The whole system is, in fact, a cascade of deci-
sions of what label to assign to a concrete instance
based on the agreement of pairs of systems, when
it is possible, or selecting the available answer from
one of them. In this way, supervised are preferred to
unsupervised methods, but these last ones are able
to tag such words that not have available training
data.
1 Introduction
Designing a system for Natural Language Process-
ing (NLP) requires a large knowledge on language
structure, morphology, syntax, semantics and prag-
matic nuances. All of these different linguistic
knowledge forms, however, have a common asso-
ciated problem, their many ambiguities, which are
difficult to resolve.
In this paper we concentrate on the resolution
of the lexical ambiguity that appears when a given
word in a context has several different meanings.
? This paper has been partially supported by the Spanish
Government (CICyT) under project number TIC-2003-7180
and the Valencia Government (OCyT) under project number
CTIDIB-2002-151
This specific task is commonly referred as Word
Sense Disambiguation (WSD). This is a difficult
problem that is receiving a great deal of attention
from the research community because its resolu-
tion can help other NLP applications as Machine
Translation (MT), Information Retrieval (IR), Text
Processing, Grammatical Analysis, Information Ex-
traction (IE), hypertext navigation and so on.
The R2D2 Team has participated in two tasks:
English all-words and lexical sample. We use sev-
eral different systems both supervised and unsuper-
vised. The supervised methods are based on Max-
imum Entropy (ME) (Lau et al, 1993; Berger et
al., 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1998), neural network using
the Learning Vector Quantization algorithm (Koho-
nen, 1995) and Specialized Hidden Markov Mod-
els (Pla, 2000). The unsupervised methods are Rel-
evant Domains (RD) (Montoyo et al, 2003) and
the CIAOSENSO WSD system which is based on
Conceptual Density (Agirre and Rigau, 1995), fre-
quency of WordNet (Miller et al, 1993a) senses and
WordNet Domains (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000).
In the following section we will show a more
complete description of the systems. Next, how
such methods were combined in two voting sys-
tems, and the results obtained in SENSEVAL-3. Fi-
nally, some conclusions will be presented.
2 Systems description
In this section the systems that have participated at
SENSEVAL-3 will be described.
2.1 Maximum Entropy
ME modeling provides a framework for integrating
information for classification from many heteroge-
neous information sources (Manning and Schu?tze,
1999). ME probability models have been success-

Sua?rez and Palomar, 2002), and as meta-learner in
(Ilhan et al, 2001).
Our ME-based system has been shown competi-
tive (Ma`rquez et al, 2003) when compared to other
supervised systems such as Decision Lists, Support
Vector Machines, and AdaBoost. The features that
were defined to train the system are those described
in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Features Used for the Supervised Learn-
ing of the ME system
Because the ME system needs annotated data
for the training, Semcor (Miller et al, 1993b) was
used for the English All-Words task, the system
was trained using Semcor (Miller et al, 1993b), and
parsed by Minipar (Lin, 1998). Only those words
that have 10 examples or more in Semcor were pro-
cessed in order to obtain a ME classifier.
For the Spanish Lexical Sample task, the train-
ing data from SENSEVAL-3 was the source of la-
beled examples. We did not use any parser, just the
lemmatization and POS-tagging information sup-
plied into the training data itself.
2.2 UPV-SHMM-AW
The upv-shmm-aw WSD system is a supervised ap-
proach based on Specialized Hidden Markov Mod-
els (SHMM).
Basically, a SHMM consists of changing the
topology of a Hidden Markov Model in order to get
a more accurate model which includes more infor-
mation. This is done by means of an initial step
previous to the learning process. It consists of the
redefinition of the input vocabulary and the output
tags. This redefinition is done by means of two pro-
cesses which transform the training set: the selec-
tion process chooses which input features (words,
lemmas, part-of-speech tags, ...) are relevant to the
task, and the specialization process redefines the
output tags by adding information from the input.
This specialization produces some changes in the
model topology, in order to allow the model to bet-
ter capture some contextual restrictions and to get a
more accurate model.
We used as training data the part of the Sem-
Cor corpus that is semantically annotated and su-
pervised for nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs,
and the test data set provided by SENSEVAL-2.
We used 10% of the training corpus as a develop-
ment data set in order to determine the best selection
and specialization criteria.
In the experiments, we used WordNet1.6 (Miller
et al, 1993a) as a dictionary that supplies all the
possible semantic senses for a given word. Our sys-
tem disambiguated all the polysemic lemmas, that
is, the coverage of our system was 100%. For un-
known words (words that did not appear in the train-
ing data set), we assigned the first sense in WordNet.
2.3 Relevant Domains
This is an unsupervised WSD method based on the
WordNet Domains lexical resource (Magnini and
Cavaglia, 2000). The underlaying working hypoth-
esis is that domain labels, such as ARCHITEC-
TURE, SPORT and MEDICINE provide a natural
way to establish semantic relations between word
senses, that can be used during the disambiguation
process. This resource has already been used on
Word Sense Disambiguation (Magnini and Strappa-
rava, 2000), but it has not made use of glosses infor-
mation. So our approach make use of a new lexical
resource obtained from glosses information named
Relevant Domains.
First step is to obtain the Relevant Domains re-
source from WordNet glosses. For this task is nec-
essary a previous part-of-speech tagging of Word-
Net glosses (each gloss has associated a domain la-
bel). So we extract all nouns, verbs, adjectives and
adverbs from glosses and assign them their associ-
ated domain label. With this information and using
the Association Ratio formula(w=word,D=domain
label), in (1), we obtain the Relevant Domains re-
source.
AR(w,D) = Pr(w|D)log2Pr(w|D)Pr(w) (1)
The final result is for each word, a set of domain
labels sorted by Association Ratio, for example,
for word plant? its Relevant Domains are: genetics
0.177515, ecology 0.050065, botany 0.038544 . . . .
Once obtained Relevant Domains the disam-
biguation process is carried out. We obtain from
the text source the context words that co-occur with
the word to be disambiguated (context could be
a sentence or a window of words). We obtain a
context vector from Relevant Domains and context
words (in case of repeated domain labels, they are
weighted). Furthermore we need a sense vector ob-
tained in the same way as context vector from words
of glosses of each word sense. We select the cor-
rect sense using the cosine measure between con-
text vector and sense vectors. So the selected sense
is that for which the cosine with the context vector
is closer to one.
2.4 LVQ-JA ?EN-ELS
The LVQ-JA ?EN-ELS system (Garc??a-Vega et al,
2003) is based on a supervised learning algorithm
for WSD. The method trains a neural network using
the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm
(Kohonen, 1995), integrating Semcor and several
semantic relations of WordNet.
The Vector Space Model (VSM) is used as an in-
formation representation model. Each sense of a
word is represented as a vector in an n-dimensional
space where n is the number of words in all its con-
texts.
We use the LVQ algorithm to adjust the word
weights. The input vector weights are calculated
as shown by (Salton and McGill, 1983) with the
standard (tf ? idf). They are presented to the LVQ
network and, after training, the output vectors are
obtained, containing the adjusted weights for all
senses of each word.
Any word to disambiguate is represented with a
vector in the same way. This representation must be
compared with all the trained sense vectors of the
word by applying the cosine similarity rule:
sim(wk, xi) = wk ? xi| wk | ? | xi | (2)
The sense corresponding to the vector of highest
similarity is selected as the disambiguated sense.
To train the neural network we have inte-
grated semantic information from two linguistic re-
sources: SemCor1.6 corpus and WordNet1.7.1 lex-
ical database. From Semcor1.6 we used the para-
graph as a contextual semantic unit and each con-
text was included in the training vector set. From
WordNet1.7.1 some semantic relations were consid-
ered, specifically, synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy,
homonymy, hyperonymy, meronymy, and coordi-
nate terms. This information was introduced to the
training set through the creation of artificial para-
graphs with the words of each relation. So, for a
word with 7 senses, 7 artificial paragraphs with the
synonyms of the 7 senses were added, 7 more with
all its hyponyms, and so on.
The learning algorithm is very simple. First, the
learning rate and the codebook vectors are initial-
ized. Then, the following procedure is repeated for
all the training input vectors until a stopping crite-
rion is satisfied:
- Select a training input pattern, x, with class d,
and present it to the network
- Calculate the Euclidean distance between the in-
put vector and each codebook vector || x? wk ||
- Select the codebook vector, wc, that is closest to
the input vector, x, like the winner sense.
- The winner neuron updates its weights accord-
ing the learning equation:
wc(t+ 1) = wc(t) + s ? ?(t) ? [x(t)? wc(t)] (3)
where s = 0, if k 6= c; s = 1, if x(t) and wc(t)
belong to the same class (c = d); and s = ?1, if
they do not (c 6= d). ?(t) is the learning rate, and
0 < ?(t) < 1 is a monotically decreasing func-
tion of time. It is recommended that ?(t) should
already initially be rather small, say, smaller than
0.1 (Kohonen, 1995) and ?(t) continues decreasing
to a given threshold, u, very close to 0.
2.5 CIAOSENSO
The CIAOSENSO WSD system is an unsupervised
system based on Conceptual Density, the frequency
of WordNet sense, and WordNet Domains. Concep-
tual Density is a measure of the correlation among
the sense of a given word and its context. The
noun sense disambiguation is performed by means
of a formula combining the Conceptual Density
with WordNet sense frequency (Rosso et al, 2003).
The context window used in both the English all-
words and lexical sample tasks is of 4 nouns. Ad-
ditional weights are assigned to those senses hav-
ing the same domain as the context nouns? senses.
Each weight is proportional to the frequency of such
senses, and is calculated as MDW (f, i) = 1/f ?1/i
where f is an integer representing the frequency
of the sense of the word to be disambiguated and
i gives the same information for the context word.
Example: If the word to be disambiguated is doc-
tor, the domains for senses 1 and 4 are, respec-
tively, Medicine and School. Therefore, if one of
the context words is university, the resulting weight
for doctor(4) and university(3) is 1/4 ? 1/3.
The sense disambiguation of an adjective is per-
formed only on the basis of the above weights.
Given one of its senses, we extract the synsets ob-
tained by the similar to, pertainym and attribute
relationships. For each of them, we calculate the
MDW with respect to the senses of the context
noun. The weight assigned to the adjective sense
is the average between these MDWs. The se-
lected sense is the one having the maximum average
weight.
The sense disambiguation of a verb is done nearly
in the same way, but taking into consideration only
the MDWs with the context words. In the all-words
task the context words are the noun before and af-
ter the verb, whereas in the lexical sample task the
context words are four (two before and two after the
verb), without regard to their morphological cate-
gory. This has been done in order to improve the
recall in the latter task, for which the test corpus is
made up mostly by verbs.
The sense disambiguation of adverbs (in both
tasks) is carried out in the same way of the disam-
biguation of verbs for the lexical sample task.
3 Tasks Processing
We have selected several combinations of such sys-
tems described before for two voting systems, one
for the Lexical-Sample task and the other for the
All-Words task.
3.1 English Lexical Sample Task
At the English Lexical Sample task we combined
the answers of four systems: Relevant Domains,
CIAOSENSO, LVQ-JA ?EN-ELS and Maximum En-
tropy.
The four methods worked in parallel and their
sets of answers were the input of a majority voting
procedure. This procedure selected those answers
with more systems agreements. In case of tie we
gave priority to supervised systems.
With this voting system we obtained around a
63% precision and a 52% recall.
3.2 English All Words Task
For this task we used a voting system combining
the results of Relevant Domains, Maximum En-
tropy, CIAOSENSO and UPV-SHMM-AW. So we
obtained the final results after 10 steps.
Step 1, we selected those answers with agree-
ment between ME and UPV-SHMM-AW (super-
vised systems).
Step 2, from no agreement in step 1 we selected
those answers with agreement between ME and Rel-
evant Domains.
Step 3, from no agreement in step 2 we selected
those answers with agreement between ME and
CIAOSENSO.
Step 4, from no agreement in step 3 we se-
lected those answers with agreement between
CIAOSENSO and UPV-SHMM-AW.
Step 5, from no agreement in step 4 we se-
lected those answers with agreement between UPV-
SHMM-AW and Relevant Domains.
Step 6, from no agreement in step 5 we selected
those answers with agreement between Relevant
Domains and CIAOSENSO.
Step 7, from no agreement in step 6 we selected
Maximum Entropy answers.
Step 8, from the remaining unlabeled instances
we selected UPV-SHMM-AW answers.
Step 9, from the remaining unlabeled instances
we selected Relevant Domains answers.
Step 10, from the remaining unlabeled instances
we selected CIAOSENSO answers.
Last step was labeling with the most frequent
sense in WordNet those instances that had been not
tagged by any system, but in view of the final results
only two instances had not answer and we didn?t
find them in WordNet.
With this voting system preference was given to
supervised systems over unsupervised systems.
We obtained around a 63% precision and a 63%
recall.
4 Conclusions
This paper presents the main characteristics of
the Maximum Entropy, LVQ-JAEN-ELS, UPV-
SHMM-AW, Relevant Domains and CIAOSENSO
systems within the framework of SENSEVAL-3 En-
glish Lexical Sample and All Words tasks. These
systems are combined with a voting technique ob-
taining a promising results for English All Words
and English Lexical Sample tasks.
