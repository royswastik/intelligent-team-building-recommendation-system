Abstract 
I will describe my collaborators' and my 
own effort to compile large models of 
molecular pathways in complex human 
disorders. 
The talk will address a number of interre-
lated questions: 
How to extract facts from texts at a large 
scale? 
How to assess the quality of the extracted 
facts? 
How to identify sets of conflicting or un-
reliable facts and to generate an internally 
consistent model? 
How to use the resulting pathway model 
for automated generation of biological 
hypotheses?
