Abstract 
In several recent years, natural 
language processing (NLP) has brought 
some very interesting and promising 
outcomes. In the field of information 
retrieval (IR), however, these significant 
advances have not been applied in an 
optimal way yet. 
Author argues that traditional IR 
methods, i.e. methods based on dealing 
with individual terms without considering 
their relations, can be overcome using 
NLP procedures. The reason for this 
expectation is the fact that NLP methods 
are able to detect the relations among 
terms in sentences and that the 
information obtained can be stored and 
used for searching. Features of word 
senses and the significance of word 
contexts are analysed and possibility of 
searching based on word senses instead of 
mere words is examined. 
The core part of the paper focuses on 
analysing Czech sentences and extracting 
the  context relations among words from 
them. In order to make use of 
lemmatisation and morphological and 
syntactic tagging of Czech texts, author 
proposes a method for construction of 
dependency word microcontexts fully 
automatically extracted from texts, and 
several ways how to exploit the 
microcontexts for the sake of increasing 
retrieval performance. 
1 Introduction 
Empirical methods in natural language 
processing (NLP) employ learning techniques to 
automatically extract linguistic knowledge from 
nat~al language corpora; for an overview of this 
field see (Bfill and Mooney 1997). This paper 
wants to show their usefulness in the field of 
information retrieval (IR). As the effects and the 
contribution of this discipline to IR has not been 
well examined and evaluated yet, various uses of 
NLP techniques in IR are only marginally 
mentioned in well known monographs published 
in last ten years, e.g. (Salton 1989), (Frakes and 
Baeza-Yates 1992), (Korfhage 1997). 
A textual IR system stores a collection of 
documents and special data structures for 
effective searching. A textual document is a 
sequence of terms. When analysing the content 
of a document, terms are the basic processed 
units - -  usually they are words of natural 
language. When retrieving, the IR system returns 
documents presumed to be of interest to the user 
in response to a query. The user's query is a 
formal statement of user's information eed. The 
documents that are interesting for the user 
(relative to the put query) are relevant; the others 
are non-relevant. The effectiveness of IR 
systems is usually measured in terms of 
precision, the percentage of retrieved ocuments 
that are relevant, and recall, the percentage of 
relevant documents hat are retrieved. 
The starting point of our consideration on IR 
was a critique of word-based retrieval 
techniques. Traditional IR systems treat the 
query as a pattern of words to be matched by 
documents. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of 
these word-matching systems is mostly poor 
23 
because the system retrieves only the documents 
that contain words that occttr also in the query. 
However, in fact, the user &Des not look for the 
words used in  the query. The user desires the 
sense of the words and wants to retrieve the 
documents containing word,,; having the same 
sense. In contrast to the word-based approach, a
sense-based IR system treats the query as a 
pattern of the required sense. In order to match 
this sense by the sense of words in documents, 
the senses of ambiguous words must be 
determined. Therefore a good word sense 
disambiguation is necessary ha a sense-based IR
system. 
Ambiguity and synonymity of words is a 
property of natural language causing a very 
serious problem in IR. Both ambiguous words 
and synonyms depress the effectiveness of word- 
matching systems. The direct effect of polysemy 
on word-matching systems is to decrease 
precision (e.g., queries about financial banks 
retrieve documents about rivers). Synonymity 
decreases recall. If one sense is expressed by 
different synonyms in different documents, the 
word-matching system will retrieve all the 
documents only if all the synonyms are given in 
the query. Unfortunately, polysemy has another 
negative effect: polysemy also prevents the 
effective use of thesauri. Consequently, thesauri 
cannot be directly used to eliminate the problem 
with synonyms. 
In our opinion, if a retrieval system is not 
able to identify homonyms and synonyms and to 
discriminate their senses, ambiguity and 
synonymity will remain one of the main factors 
causing 1) low recall, 2) low precision, and 3) 
the known and inevitable fact that recall and 
precision are inversely related. There are some 
evidences that lexical context analysis could be a 
good way how to eliminate or at least decrease 
these difficulties m see below. 
How to take the step from words towards 
senses? Since an application of word contexts is 
the only possibility to estimate the sense of 
words, the way of dealing with word contexts is 
a central problem in sense-based retrieval. 
Knowing word contexts we can determine the 
measure of collocating, i.e. the extent o which a 
pair of words collocates. The knowledge of 
collocations can be used in IR for several 
purposes: making up contextual representations 
of words, resolving word ambiguity, estimating 
semantic word similarity, tuning the user's query 
in interaction with the user and quantifying the 
significance of words for retrieval according to 
entropy of their contexts. 
Section 2 expresses our motivation: the 
investigation of word contexts helps us to 
develop an efficient IR system. Next section is 
devoted to analysing Czech texts and suggests a
construction of dependency microcontext 
structures making use of the tree structure 
automatically created in the process of Prague 
Dependency Treebank annotation. Further part 
focuses on applications of contextual knowledge 
in IR and refers to the project working on an 
experimental IR textual database. Finally we 
summarise the results of this study. 
2 Significance of word contexts 
Word senses are not something iven a priori. 
Humans create word senses in the process of 
thinking and using language. Thinking forms 
language and language influences thinking. It is 
impossible to separate them. Word senses are 
products of their interaction. In our opinion, the 
effort to represent word senses as fixed elements 
in a textual information system is a 
methodological mistake. 
Many researchers consider the sense of a 
word as an average of its linguistic uses. Then, 
the investigation of sense distinctions i based on 
the knowledge of contexts in which a word 
appears in a text corpus. Sense representations 
are computed as groups of similar contexts. For 
instance, Schiitze (1998) creates sense clusters 
from a corpus rather than relying on a pre- 
established sense list. He makes up the clusters 
as the sets of contextually similar occurrences of
an ambiguous word. These clusters are then 
interpreted as senses. 
According to how wide vicinity of the target 
word we include into the context we can speak 
about the local context and the topical context. 
The local or "micro"context is generally 
considered to be some small window of words 
surrounding a word occurrence in a text, from a 
few words of context o the entire sentence in 
which the target word appears. The topical 
context includes ubstantive words that co-occur 
24 
with a given word, usually within a window of 
several sentences. In contrast with the topical 
context, the microcontext may include 
information on word order, distance, 
grammatical inflections and syntactic strncture. 
In one study, Miller and Charles (1991) found 
evidence that human subjects determine the 
semandc similarity of words from the similarity 
of the contexts they are used in. They 
surnmarised this result in the so-called strong 
contextual hypothesis: 
Two words are semantically similar to the 
extent hat their contextual representations are 
similar. 
The contextual representation of a word has 
been defined as a characterisation of the 
linguistic context in which a word appears. 
Leacock, Towell and Voorhees (1996) 
demonstrated that contextual representations 
consisting of both local and topical components 
are effective for resolving word senses and can 
be automatically extracted from sample texts. No 
doubt information from both microcontext and 
topical context contributes to sense selection, but 
the relative roles and importance of information 
from different contexts, and their interrelations, 
are not well understood yet. 
Not only computers but even humans learn, 
realise, get to know and understand the meanings 
of words from the contexts in which they meet 
them. The investigation of word contexts is the 
most important, essential, unique and 
indispensable means of understanding the sense 
of words and texts. 
3 Analysing Czech texts 
Linguistic analysis of an input Czech text 
consists of a sequence of procedures depicted in 
Figure 1. The input is a Czech sentence and the 
results of the analysis are the two target 
structures: the dependency microcontext 
structure (DMCS) which we use for the 
microcontext extraction and the 
tectogrammatical tree structure (TGTS) which 
represents he underlying syntactic structure of 
the sentence. As the main intention of this paper 
is to describe the DMCS, building of the TGTS 
is distinguished by dashed line in Figure 1; we 
mention it here only for completeness and for 
comparison with the DMCS.

Key algorithms used in the process of the 
analysis are based on empirical methods and on 
previous statistical processing of training data, 
i.e. natural " language corpora providing 
statistically significant sample of correct 
decisions. Consequently, the ability of these 
procedures to provide a correct output has a 
stochastic character. These procedures were 
developed during the past years in the process of 
the Czech National Corpus and Prague 
Dependency Treebank creation. For a detailed 
descriptions see Haji6 (1998), Hladkfi (2000) and 
Collins, Haji6, Ram~haw, Tillmann (1999). 
As shown in Figure 1, the first procedure is
tokenizafion. The output of tokenization is the 
text divided into lexical atoms or tokens, i.e. 
words, numbers, punctuation marks and special 
graphical symbols. At the same time the 
boundaries of sentences and paragraphs are 
determined. 
The following procedure, i.e. morphological 
tagging and lexical disambiguation, works in two 
stages. The first is the morphological nalysis, 
which assigns each word its lemma, i.e. its basic 
word form, and its morphological tag. Since we 
often meet lexical ambiguity (i.e. it is not 
possible to determine the lemma and the tag 
uniquely without the knowledge of the word 
context), the morphological analyser often 
provides several alternatives. In the second 
stage, the result of the analysis is further used as 
an input for the lexical disambiguation assigning 
a given word form its unique lemma and 
morphological tag. 
The next procedures work with syntactic tree 
stn~ctures. This process is described in the 
following subsection. 
3.1 Syntactical analysis 
The first step of the syntactic tagging consists 
in the building of the anatytic tree structure 
(ATS) representing the surface syntactic 
dependency relations in the sentence. We use the 
statistical Collins's parser to create the stnlcture 
of the tree and then a statistical procedure to 
assign words their syntactic functions. Two 
examples of the ATS are given in figures 
2and 3.

(Lit.: It-was clear that the-state too fast will-not- 
change. E: It was clear, that the state will not 
change too fast.) 
Figure 2: An example of an ATS. 
The automatically created ATS is a labelled 
oriented acyclic graph with a single root 
(dependency tree). In the ATS every word form 
and punctuation mark is explicitly represented as
a node of the tree. Each node of the tree is 
annotated by a set of attribute-value pairs. One 
of the attributes is the analytic function that 
expresses the syntactic function of the word. The 
number of nodes in the graph is equal to the 
number of word form tokens in the sentence plus 
that of punctuation signs and a symbol for the 
sentence as such (the root of the tree). The graph 
edges represent surface syntactic relations within 
the sentence as defined in B6movfi et al(1997). 
The created ATS is further transformed either 
to the TGTS or to the DMCS. In the Prague 
Dependency Treebank annotation, the 
transduction of the ATS to the TGTS is 
performed (see BShmovfi and I-Iaji~ovfi 1999). 
For the sake of the construction of word contexts, 
we use the lemmas of word forms, their part of 
speech, their analytic function and we adapted the 
algorithms aiming towards the TGTS to build a 
similar structure, DMCS. Since, in comparison 
with the ATS, in both the TGTS and the DMCS 
only autosemantic words have nodes of their own, 
the first stage of this transformation (i.e. the 
pruning of the tree structure) is common.

Figure 3: An example of an ATS. 
3.2 F rom ATS towards  DMCS 
The transduction of the ATS to the DMCS 
consists of the four procedures: 
1. Pruning of the tree structure, i.e. 
elimination of the auxiliary nodes and 
joining the complex word forms into one 
node. 
2. Transformation of the structures of 
coordinations and appositions. 
3. Transformation of the nominal 
predicates. 
4. Transformation f the complements. 
The first step of the transformation of the 
ATS to the respective DMCS is deletion of the 
auxiliary nodes. By the auxiliary nodes we 
understand nodes for prepositions, subordinate 
conjunctions, rhematizers (including negation) 
and punctuation. In case the deleted node is not a 
leaf of the tree, we reorganise the tree. For the IR 
purposes the auxiliary verbs do not carry any 
sense, so the analytical verb forms are treated as 
one single node with the lernma of the main 
verb. The purpose of the next three procedures i  
to obtain the context relations among words from 
the sentence, so we call them context 
transformations. 
The constructions of coordination and 
apposition are represented by a special node 
(usually the node of the coordinating conjunction 
or other expression) that is the governor of the 
coordinated subtrees and their common 
complementation in the ATS. The heads of the 
coordinated subtrees are marked by a special 
feature. In case of coordinated attributes, the 
transformation algorithm deletes the special 
node, which means that a separate microcontext 
(X, Atr, Y) is extracted for each member of 
coordination. The same procedure is used for 
adverbials, objects and subjects. If two clauses 
occur coordinated, the special node remains in 
the structure, as the clauses are handled 
separately.

Figure 2. 
Probably the main difference from the 
syntactic analysis is the way we are dealing with 
the nominal predicate. We consider the nominal 
predicate to act as a normal predicate, though not 
expressed by a verb. This way of understanding 
a predicate is very close to predicate logic, where 
the sentence "The grass is green" is considered to
express aformula such as "green(grass)". 
In the ATS the complement (word 
syntactically depending both on the verb and the 
noun) is placed as a daughter node of the noun 
and marked by the analytical function of Atv. In 
the DMCS this node is copied and its analytical 
function is changed to Attr for the occurrence of 
the daughter of the noun and Adv for the new 
token of the daughter of the governing verb. 
As we cannot go into details here, we 
illustrate the DMCS by two examples given in 
figures 4 and 5. The nodes of the trees represent 
semantically significant words. The edges of the 
graphs are labelled by so called dependency 
types (see below). 
3.3 Extraction of microcontexts from the 
DMCS 
There are I0 parts of speech in Czech and 18 
types of analytic function in ATSs. However, we 
will consider only four parts of speech, namely 
nouns (N), adjectives (A), verbs (V) and adverbs 
(D), and four types of analytic function, namely 
subject (Sb), object (Obj), adverbial (Adv) and 
attribute (Attr), because only these are 
significant for the purpose of retrieval. 
The construction of the dependency 
microcontext is based on the identification of 
significant dependency relationships (SDRs) in 
the sentence. An SDR consists of two words and 
a dependency t pe. An SDR is a triple \[wl, DT, 
w2\], where wl is a head word (lexical unit), DT 
is a dependency t pe and w2 is a depending word 
(lexical unit). A dependency t pe is a triple (P1, 
AF, P2), where Pi is the part of speech of the 
head word, AF is an analytic function and P2 is 
the part of speech of the depending word. 
For example, (A, Adv, D) is a dependency 
type expressing the relationship between words 
in expression "very large" where "very" is a 
depending adverb and "large" is a head adjective. 
\[large, (A, Adv, D), very\] is an example of an 
SDR. 
Considering 4 significant parts of speech and 
4 analytic functions, we have 64 (= 4x4x4) 
possible distinct dependency types. In Czech, 
however, only 28 of them really occur. Thus, we 
have 28 distinct dependency types shown in 
Table 1. Table 2 surnmarises the number of 
dependency t pes for each part of speech. The 
dependency t pes marked by an asterisk are not 
the usual syntactic relations in Czech, they were 
added on account of the transformation f the 
nominal predicate. 
The number of SDRs extracted from one 
sentence is always only a little smaller than the 
number of significant, autosemantic words in the 
sentence, because almost all these words are 
depending on another word and make an SDR 
with it. 
Now we define the dependency word 
microcontext (DMC). A DMC of a given word w 
is a list of its microcontext elements (MCEs). An 
MCE is a pair consisting of a word and a 
dependency type. If a word w occurs in a 
sentence and forms an SDR with another word 
wl, i.e. if there is an SDR \[w, DT, wd or \[wl, 
DT', w\], then w~ and the dependency t pe DT or 
DT', respectively, constitute a mierocontext 
element \[DT, wd or \[wl, DT'\], respectively, of 
the word w. The first case implies that w is a 
head word in the SDR and in the second case the 
word w is a dependant. 
Thus, each SDR \[wl, DT, w2\] in a text 
produces two MCEs: \[w~, DT\] is an dement of 
the context of Wz and \[DT, w2\] is an element of 
the context of w~.

4 Applications 
4.1 Contextual  knowledge in IR  
As we have already mentioned, the 
knowledge of word contexts can be used for 
resolving word ambiguity. Word sense 
disambiguation is a central problem in NLP. Its 
task is to assign sense labels to occurrences of an 
ambiguous word. Researchers dealing with WSD 
methods often inspect also the way it affects 
retrieval performance if used in a retrieval 
model. Krovetz and Croft (1992) demonstrated 
that WSD can improve text retrieval 
performance. Later, Schiitze and Pedersen 
(1995) found a noticeable improvement in 
precision using sense-based retrieval and word 
sense discrimination. Towell and Voorhees 
(1998) showed that, given accurate WSD, the 
lexical relations encoded in lexicons such as 
WordNet can be exploited to improve the 
effectiveness of IR systems. 
Schiitze (1998) introduced an interesting 
method: word sense discrimination. This 
technique is easier than full disambiguation since 
it only determines which occurrences of a given 
word have the same meaning and not what the 
? meaning actually is. Moreover, while other 
disambiguation algorithms employ various 
sources of information, this method ispenses of 
an outside source of knowledge for defining 
senses. For many problems in information 
access, it is sufficient to solve the discrimination 
problem only. Schiitze and Pedersen (1995) 
measured ocument-query similarity based on 
word senses rather on words and achieved a 
considerable improvement in ranking relevant 
documents. No references to externally defined 
senses are necessary for measurement of 
similarity. 
4.2 Using microcontexts  
In this subsection we give several ideas how 
to employ the microcontexts for improving the 
retrieval performance. Their significance and the 
extent of their usefulness is to be verified 
experimentally. For more details refer to Holub 
(2000). 
In the literature, we can meet different 
definitions of collocation (cf. Ide and Vdronis, 
1998). Following Yarowsky (1993), who 
explicitly addresses the use of collocations in the 
WSD work, we adopt his definition, adapted to 
our purpose: A collocation is a co-occurrence of
two words in a defined relation. Dependency 
microcontexts and collocations can be treated as 
mutually equivalent concepts in the sense that 
collocations can be derived from the knowledge 
of microcontexts and vice versa. In order to 
separate significant collocations from word pairs 
which occurred merely by a coincidence, we can 
compute the measure of collocating of a word 
and an MCE as the mutual information of the 
probability of their occurrence. 
We also use the knowledge of collocations 
for computing the context similarity measure of 
two words. Assuming the "strong contextual 
hypothesis", the context similarity of words 
implies their semantic similarity, too. 
Consequently, we can estimate the semantic 
similarity of words.

30 
Another application of microcontexts consists in 
determining the context entropy of the words. 
Based on the context entropy we can distinguish 
vague and specific words and give them different 
weights for retrieval. 
In order to improve retrieval performance by a 
modification of the query, two methods can be 
employed. The first is query expansion replacing 
words in the query with a set of words of the same 
meaning. It should ensure a higher recall. The 
second is query refinement, i.e. specifying the 
senses of query terms more precisely to avoid 
ambiguity of the query. 
Asking a query, the user can be offered 
collocations of the terms used in the query. Then 
the user can decrease the vagueness of the 
(ambiguous) query terms by the choice of 
collocations that are characteristic for the sense 
required. It seems to be a good way of refining a 
query. The user can be also offered a list of words 
identified by the system as similar to query terms. 
Then the user can modify the query or even 
compose an aitemative xpression for the same 
query sense. This is a way to decrease or eliminate 
the negative influence of synonyms in relevant 
documents. 
4.3 Experimental databases  
In order to test the methods mentioned above 
we are developing two experimental databases. 
The first is the database of dependency 
microcontexts extracted from a large text corpus. 
We should obtain a lot of useful statistical data 
from it. 
The second experimental database is a textual 
system MATES (MAster of TExt Sources). The 
main purpose of MATES is to serve as a textual 
database for experiments with various information 
retrieval methods. 
MATES is constructed universally, not only for 
certain given retrieval algorithms, and it is adapted 
for the work with Czech language. Using MATES, 
it is possible to store both the originals of the input 
documents and their linguistically pre-processed 
versions. MATES supports grouping of 
documents into collections. For each collection an 
index is built and additional data structures are 
created that enable storing all the additional 
information about each term, each document and 
about their relations. This additional data can be 
used by the retrieval module. 
In the near future, the MATES system should 
enable us to test the methods proposed here and 
evaluate their contribution to IR as well. 
5 Conclusion 
In the presented study, it is pointed out that 
ambiguity of language as well as synonymy are 
the serious obstacles preventing retrieval based on 
sense of the user's query. We describe an 
approach employing the lexical contexts to 
overcome or at least to reduce these difficulties. In 
order to recapitulate he results of this study and to 
make them more clear, we can sum up the 
essential and most important ideas into the 
following principles: 
1. As to retrieval performance, word-based IR 
systems can be superseded by sense-based 
ones using effective techniques that are able to 
identify and compare meanings or senses of 
words. The structure of the IR system should 
contain the word context information retrieved 
from texts. 
2. The closest core of the word context cannot be 
extracted based on word order. Therefore 
knowledge of the syntactic relations, which 
does carry this information, should be used. 
3. The dependency tree containing all the surface 
dependency relations (ATS) contains 
information not relevant for the contexts 
extraction (with respect to IR needs), therefore 
we reduce this structure and we gather a 
structure containing only the semantically 
significant words and 4 main types of 
syntactic dependencies. 
4. We present an algorithm for construction of 
the DMCS meeting the previously mentioned 
requirements, the DMCS allows for extraction 
of word microcontexts. The accuracy of this 
process depends on the quality of the used 
syntactic parser. 
5. The statistical knowledge of lexical contexts 
can help especially to determine the 
importance of lexical units for retrieval and to 
tune the user's query in interaction with the 
31 
. 
user using the knowledge of collocations and 
word similaritty. Thus, the database of the 
retrieved microcontexts can be used for 
improving the performance of sense-based IR 
systems. 
Uncertainty and vagueness in the text retrieval 
cannot be eliminated entirely since they are 
caused primarily by the character of the 
human thinking necessarily determining also 
the character of natural language. 
Our long-term goal is to design an efficient IR 
system using the best methods of natural language 
analysis. The presented analyses as well as 
building the experimental textual database 
MATES are likely to be significant steps towards 
that goal.
