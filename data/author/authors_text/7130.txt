Abstract 
In this paper, we describe a system to rank sus- 
pected answers to natural language questions. 
We process both corpus and query using a new 
technique, predictive annotation, which aug- 
ments phrases in texts with labels anticipating 
their being targets of certain kinds of questions. 
Given a natural anguage question, our IR sys- 
tem returns a set of matching passages, which 
we then rank using a linear function of seven 
predictor variables. We provide an evaluation of 
the techniques based on results from the TREC 
Q&A evaluation in which our system partici- 
pated. 
1 Introduction 
Question Answering is a task that calls for a 
combination of techniques from Information Re- 
trieval and Natural Language Processing. The 
former has the advantage of years of develop- 
ment of efficient techniques for indexing and 
searching large collections of data, but lacks of 
any meaningful treatment of the semantics of 
the query or the texts indexed. NLP tackles 
the semantics, but tends to be computationally 
expensive. 
We have attempted to carve out a middle 
ground, whereby we use a modified IR system 
augmented by shallow NL parsing. Our ap- 
proach was motivated by the following problem 
with traditional IR systems. Suppose the user 
asks "Where did <some event> happen?". If 
the system does no pre-processing of the query, 
then "where" will be included in the bag of 
words submitted to the search engine, but this 
will not be helpful since the target text will 
be unlikely to contain the word "where". If 
the word is stripped out as a stop-word, then 
* The work presented in this paper was performed while 
the first and third authors were at 1BM Research. 
the search engine will have no idea that a lo- 
cation is sought. Our approach, called predic- 
tive annotation, is to augment he query with 
semantic ategory markers (which we call QA- 
Tokens), in this case with the PLACES to- 
ken, and also to label with QA-Tokens all oc- 
currences in text that are recognized entities, 
(for example, places). Then traditional bag-of- 
words matching proceeds uccessfully, and will 
return matching passages. The answer-selection 
process then looks for and ranks in these pas- 
sages occurrences ofphrases containing the par- 
ticular QA-Token(s) from the augmented query. 
This classification of questions is conceptually 
similar to the query expansion in (Voorhees, 
1994) but is expected to achieve much better 
performance since potentially matching phrases 
in text are classified in a similar and synergistic 
way. 
Our system participated in the official TREC 
Q&A evaluation. For 200 questions in the eval- 
uation set, we were asked to provide a list of 
50-byte and 250-byte xtracts from a 2-GB cor- 
pus. The results are shown in Section 7. 
Some techniques used by other participants in
the TREC evaluation are paragraph indexing, 
followed by abductive inference (Harabagiu and 
Maiorano, 1999) and knowledge-representation 
combined with information retrieval (Breck et 
al., 1999). Some earlier systems related to our 
work are FaqFinder (Kulyukin et al, 1998), 
MURAX (Kupiec, 1993), which uses an encyclo- 
pedia as a knowledge base from which to extract 
answers, and PROFILE (Radev and McKeown, 
1997) which identifies named entities and noun 
phrases that describe them in text. 
2 System description 
Our system (Figure 1) consists of two pieces: 
an IR component (GuruQA) that which returns 
matching texts, and an answer selection compo- 
150 
neat (AnSel/Werlect) that extracts and ranks 
potential answers from these texts. 
This paper focuses on the process of rank- 
ing potential answers selected by the IR engine, 
which is itself described in (Prager et al, 1999).

Figure 1: System Architecture. 
2.1 The Information Retrieval 
component 
In the context of fact-seeking questions, we 
made the following observations: 
? In documents that contain the answers, the 
query terms tend to occur in close proxim- 
ity to each other. 
? The answers to fact-seeking questions are 
usually phrases: "President Clinton", "in 
the Rocky Mountains", and "today"). 
? These phrases can be categorized by a set of 
a dozen or so labels (Figure 2) correspond- 
ing to question types. 
? The phrases can be identified in text by 
pattern matching techniques (without full 
NLP). 
As a result, we defined a set of about 20 cat- 
egories, each labeled with its own QA-Token, 
and built an IR system which deviates from the 
traditional model in three important aspects. 
? We process the query against a set of ap- 
proximately 200 question templates which, 
may replace some of the query words 
with a set of QA-Tokens, called a SYN-  
class. Thus "Where" gets mapped 
to "PLACES", but "How long " goes 
to "@SYN(LENGTH$, DURATIONS)". 
Some templates do not cause complete re- 
placement of the matched string. For ex- 
ample, the pattern "What is the popula- 
tion" gets replaced by "NUMBERS popu- 
lation'. 
? Before indexing the text, we process it 
with Textract (Byrd and Ravin, 1998; 
Wacholder et al, 1997), which performs 
lemmatization, and discovers proper names 
and technical terms. We added a new 
module (Resporator) which annotates text 
segments with QA-Tokens using pattern 
matching. Thus the text "for 5 centuries" 
matches the DURATIONS pattern "for 
:CARDINAL _timeperiod", where :CAR- 
DINAL is the label for cardinal numbers, 
and _timeperiod marks a time expression. 
? GuruQA scores text passages instead of 
documents. We use a simple document- 
and collection-independent weighting 
scheme: QA-Tokens get a weight of 400, 
proper nouns get 200 and any other word 
- 100 (stop words are removed in query 
processing after the pattern template 
matching operation). The density of 
matching query tokens within a passage is 
contributes a score of 1 to 99 (the highest 
scores occur when all matched terms are 
consecutive). 
Predictive Annotation works best for Where, 
When, What, Which and How+adjective ques- 
tions than for How+verb and Why questions, 
since the latter are typically not answered by 
phrases. However, we observed that "by" + 
the present participle would usually indicate 
the description of a procedure, so we instan- 
tiate a METHODS QA-Token for such occur- 
rences. We have no such QA-Token for Why 
questions, but we do replace the word "why" 
with "@SYN(result, cause, because)", since the 
occurrence of any of these words usually beto- 
kens an explanation. 
3 Answer  select ion 
So far, we have described how we retrieve rel- 
evant passages that may contain the answer to 
a query. The output of GuruQA is a list of 
10 short passages containing altogether a large

number (often more than 30 or 40) of potential 
answers in the form of phrases annotated with 
QA-Tokens. 
3.1 Answer  rank ing  
We now describe two algorithms, AnSel and 
Werlect, which rank the spans returned by Gu- 
ruQA. AnSel and Werlect 1 use different ap- 
proaches, which we describe, evaluate and com- 
pare and contrast. The output of either system 
consists of five text extracts per question that 
contain the likeliest answers to the questions. 
3.2 Sample  Input to AnSel /Wer lect  
The role of answer selection is to decide which 
among the spans extracted by GuruQA are 
most likely to contain the precise answer to the 
questions. Figure 3 contains an example of the 
data structure passed from GuruQA to our an- 
swer selection module. 
The input consists of four items: 
? a query (marked with <QUERY> tokens 
in the example), 
? a list of 10 passages (one of which is shown 
above), 
? a list of annotated text spans within the 
passages, annotated with QA-Tokens, and 
1 from ANswer SELect and ansWER seLECT, respec- 
tively 
? the SYN-class corresponding to the type of 
question (e.g., "PERSONS NAMES"). 
The text in Figure 3 contains five spans (po- 
tential answers), of which three ("Biography of 
Margaret Thatcher", "Hugo Young", and "Mar- 
garet Thatcher") are of types included in the 
SYN-class for the question (PERSON NAME). 
The full output of GuruQA for this question in- 
cludes a total of 14 potential spans (5 PERSONs 
and 9 NAMEs). 
3.3 Sample  Output  o f  AnSel /Wer lect  
The answer selection module has two outputs: 
internal (phrase) and external (text passage). 
Internal output:  The internal output is a 
ranked list of spans as shown in Table 1. It 
represents a ranked list of the spans (potential 
answers) sent by GuruQA. 
Externa l  output :  The external output is 
a ranked list of 50-byte and 250-byte xtracts. 
These extracts are selected in a way to cover 
the highest-ranked spans in the list of potential 
answers. Examples are given later in the paper. 
The external output was required for the 
TREC evaluation while system's internal out- 
put can be used in a variety of applications, e.g., 
to highlight the actual span that we believe is 
the answer to the question within the context 
of the passage in which it appears.

4 Ana lys i s  o f  corpus  and quest ion 
sets 
In this section we describe the corpora used for 
training and evaluation as well as the questions 
contained in the training and evaluation ques- 
tion sets. 
4.1 Corpus  analysis 
For both training and evaluation, we used the 
TREC corpus, consisting of approximately 2
GB of articles from four news agencies. 
4.2 Training set TR38 
To train our system, we used 38 questions (see 
Figure 4) for which the answers were provided 
by NIST. 
4.3 Test set T200 
The majority of the 200 questions (see Figure 5) 
in the evaluation set (T200) were not substan- 
tially different from these in TR38, although the 
introduction of "why" and "how" questions as 
well as the wording of questions in the format 
"Name X" made the task slightly harder.

5 AnSe l  
AnSel uses an optimization algorithm with 7 
predictive variables to describe how likely a 
given span is to be the correct answer to a 
question. The variables are illustrated with ex- 
amples related to the sample question number 
10001 from TR38 "Who was Johnny Mathis' 
high school track coach?". The potential an- 
swers (extracted by GuruQA) are shown in Ta- 
ble 2. 
5.1 Feature selection 
The seven span features described below were 
found to correlate with the correct answers. 
Number :  position of the span among M1 spans 
returned from the hit-list. 
Rspanno:  position of the span among all spans 
returned within the current passage. 
Count:  number of spans of any span class re- 
trieved within the current passage. 
Notinq: the number of words in the span that 
do not appear in the query. 
Type: the position of the span type in the list 
of potential span types. Example: Type 
("Lou Vasquez") = 1, because the span 
type of "Lou Vasquez", namely "PER- 
SON" appears first in the SYN-class "PER- 
SON ORG NAME ROLE". 
Avgdst:  the average distance in words between 
the beginning of the span and query words 
that also appear in the passage. Example: 
given the passage "Tim O'Donohue, Wood- 
bridge High School's varsity baseball coach, 
resigned Monday and will be replaced by 
assistant Johnny Ceballos, Athletic Direc- 
tor Dave Cowen said." and the span "Tim 
O'Donohue", the value of avgdst is equal 
to 8. 
Sscore: passage relevance as computed by Gu- 
ruQA. 
Number :  the position of the span among all 
retrieved spans. 
5.2 AnSel  algorithm 
The TOTAL score for a given potential answer 
is computed as a linear combination of the fea- 
tures described in the previous ubsection: 
TOTAL  = ~ w~ , fi 
i 
The Mgorithm that the training component 
of AnSel uses to learn the weights used in the 
formula is shown in Figure 7. 
For each <question,span> tuple in training 
set : 
i. Compute features for each span 
2. Compute TOTAL score for each span 
using current set of weights 
Kepeat 
3. Compute performance on training 
set 
4. Adjust weights wi through 
logistic regression 
Until performance > threshold 
Figure 7: Training algorithm used by AnSel. 
Training discovered the following weights: 
Wnurnbe r -~ --0.3; Wrspann o -~ --0.5; Wcount : 
3 .0 ;  Wnot inq  = 2 .0 ;  Wtypes  = 15 .0 ;  Wavgdst  ---- 
-1.0; W~score = 1.5 
At runtime, the weights are used to rank po- 
tential answers. Each span is assigned a TO- 
TAL score and the top 5 distinct extracts of 
50 (or 250) bytes centered around the span are 
output. The 50-byte xtracts for question 10001 
are shown in Figure 8. For lack of space, we are 
omitting the 250-byte xtracts. 
6 Wer lec t  
The Werlect algorithm used many of the same 
features of phrases used by AnSel, but employed 
a different ranking scheme. 
6.1 Approach 
Unlike AnSel, Werlect is based on a two-step, 
rule-based process approximating a function 
with interaction between variables. In the first 
stage of this algorithm, we assign a rank to

every relevant phrase within each sentence ac- 
cording to how likely it is to be the target an- 
swer. Next, we generate and rank each N-byte 
fragment based on the sentence score given by 
GuruQA, measures of the fragment's relevance, 
and the ranks of its component phrases. Unlike 
AnSel, Werlect was optimized through manual 
trial-and-error using the TR38 questions. 
6.2 Step  One: Feature  Se lect ion  
The features considered in Werlect that were 
also used by AnSel, were Type, Avgdst and Ss- 
core. Two additional features were also taken 
into account: 
Not inqW:  a modified version of Notinq. As 
in AnSel, spans that are contained in the 
query are given a rank of 0. However, par- 
tial matches are weighted favorably in some 
cases. For example, if the question asks, 
"Who was Lincoln's Secretary of State?" 
a noun phrase that contains "Secretary of 
State" is more likely to be the answer than 
one that does not. In this example, the 
phrase, "Secretary of State William Se- 
ward" is the most likely candidate. This 
criterion also seems to play a role in the 
event that Resporator fails to identify rel- 
evant phrase types. For example, in the 
training question, "What shape is a por- 
poise's tooth?" the phrase "spade-shaped" 
is correctly selected from among all nouns 
and adjectives of the sentences returned by 
Guru-QA. 
F requency :  how often the span occurs across 
different passages. For example, the test 
question, "How many lives were lost in the 
Pan Am crash in Lockerbie, Scotland?" re- 
sulted in four potential answers in the first 
two sentences returned by Guru-QA. Ta- 
ble 3 shows the frequencies of each term, 
and their eventual influence on the span 
rank. The repeated occurrence of "270", 
helps promote it to first place. 
6.3 Step  two:  rank ing the  sentence  
spans  
After each relevant span is assigned a rank, we 
rank all possible text segments of 50 (or 250) 
bytes from the hit list based on the sum of the 
phrase ranks plus additional points for other 
words in the segment that match the query. 
The algorithm used by Werlect is shown in 
Figure 9.

noted that on the 14 questions we were unable 
to classify with a QA-Token, Werlect (runs W50 
and W250) achieved an MRAR of 3.5 to Ansel's 
2.0. 
The cumulative RAR of A50 on T200 (Ta- 
ble 4) is 63.22 (i.e., we got 49 questions among 
the 198 right from our first try and 39 others 
within the first five answers). 
The performance of A250 on T200 is shown 
in Table 5. We were able to answer 71 questions 
with our first answer and 38 others within our 
first five answers (cumulative RAR = 85.17). 
To better characterize the performance of our 
system, we split the 198 questions into 20 groups 
of 10 questions. Our performance on groups 
of questions ranged from 0.87 to 5.50 MRAR 
for A50 and from 1.98 to 7.5 MRAR for A250 
(Table 6). 
Figure 9: Algorithm used by Werlect. 
7 Eva luat ion  
In this section, we describe the performance of
our system using results from our four official 
runs. 
7.1 Evaluat ion scheme 
For each question, the performance is computed 
as the reciprocal value of the rank (RAR) of 
the highest-ranked correct answer given by the 
system. For example, if the system has given 
the correct answer in three positions: second, 
third, and fifth, RAR for that question is ! 2" 
The Mean Reciprocal Answer Rank (MRAR) 
is used to compute the overall performance of
systems participating in the TREC evaluation: 
RAR - rank i  MRAR = . rank i  )

marginally better than Werlect. However, we

Table 6: Performance on groups of ten questions 
Finally, Table 7 shows how our official runs 
compare to the rest of the 25 official submis- 
sions. Our performance using AnSel and 50- 
byte output was 0.430. The performance of 
Werlect was 0.395. On 250 bytes, AnSel scored 
0.319 and Werlect - 0.280. 
8 Conc lus ion  
We presented a new technique, predict ive an- 
notat ion,  for finding answers to natural an- 
guage questions in text corpora. We showed 
that a system based on predictive annotation 
can deliver very good results compared to other 
competing systems. 
We described a set of features that correlate 
with the plausibility of a given text span be- 
ing a good answer to a question. We experi-

Table 7: Comparison of our system with the other participants 
mented with two algorithms for ranking poten- 
tial answers based on these features. We discov- 
ered that a linear combination of these features 
performs better overall, while a non-linear algo- 
rithm performs better on unclassified questions.
