Abstract
We present an investigation of recently
proposed character and word sequence
kernels for the task of authorship attribu-
tion based on relatively short texts. Per-
formance is compared with two corre-
sponding probabilistic approaches based
on Markov chains. Several configurations
of the sequence kernels are studied on a
relatively large dataset (50 authors), where
each author covered several topics. Utilis-
ing Moffat smoothing, the two probabilis-
tic approaches obtain similar performance,
which in turn is comparable to that of char-
acter sequence kernels and is better than
that of word sequence kernels. The results
further suggest that when using a realistic
setup that takes into account the case of
texts which are not written by any hypoth-
esised authors, the amount of training ma-
terial has more influence on discrimination
performance than the amount of test mate-
rial. Moreover, we show that the recently
proposed author unmasking approach is
less useful when dealing with short texts.
1 Introduction
Applications of authorship attribution include pla-
giarism detection (e.g. college essays), deducing
the writer of inappropriate communications that
were sent anonymously or under a pseudonym
(e.g. threatening or harassing e-mails), as well
as resolving historical questions of unclear or
disputed authorship. Specific examples are the
Federalist papers (Hanus and Hagenauer, 2005;
Mosteller, 1984) and the forensic analysis of the
Unabomber manifesto (Foster, 2001).
Within the area of automatic author at-
tribution, recently it has been shown that
encouraging performance can be achieved
via the use of probabilistic models based on
n-grams (Clement and Sharp, 2003) and Markov
chains of characters and words (Peng et al, 2004).
Diederich et al (2003) showed that Support Vector
Machines (SVMs), using the bag-of-words kernel,
can obtain promising performance, while in an-
other study, SVMs with kernels based on character
collocations obtained mixed performance (Cor-
ney, 2003). Gamon (2004) utilised SVMs with
syntactic and semantic features to obtain relatively
minor accuracy improvements over the use of
function word frequencies and part-of-speech
trigrams. Koppel & Schler (2004) proposed a
word-level heuristic, resembling recursive feature
elimination used for cancer classification (Guyon
et al, 2002; Huang and Kecman, 2005), to obtain
author unmasking curves. The curves were
processed to obtain feature vectors that were in
turn classified in a traditional SVM setting.
The studies listed above have several limita-
tions. In (Clement and Sharp, 2003), a rudimen-
tary probability smoothing technique was used to
handle n-grams which were unseen during the
training phase. In the dataset used by (Peng et al,
2004) each author tended to stick to one or two
topics, raising the possibility that the discrimina-
tion was based on topic rather than by author style.
In (Corney, 2003; Gamon, 2004; Peng et al,
2004; Koppel and Schler, 2004) the datasets were
rather small in terms of the number of authors,
indicating the results may not be generalisable.
Specifically, in (Corney, 2003) the largest dataset
contains texts from five authors, in (Gamon, 2004)
from three, while in (Peng et al, 2004) and (Kop-
pel and Schler, 2004) from ten.
In (Clement and Sharp, 2003; Gamon, 2004;
Peng et al, 2004), the attribution of a given doc-
ument was forced to one of the authors from a
set of possible authors (i.e. a closed set identifi-
cation setup), thus not taking into account the re-
alistic case of having a document which was not
482
written by any of the authors. In (Koppel and
Schler, 2004), the unmasking method was evalu-
ated exclusively on books, raising the question as
to whether the method is applicable to consider-
ably shorter texts.
Lastly, all of the studies used different datasets
and experiment setups, thus making a quantita-
tive performance comparison of the different ap-
proaches infeasible.
Recently, various practical character and word
sequence kernels have been proposed (Cancedda
et al, 2003; Leslie et al, 2004; Vishwanathan
and Smola, 2003) for the purposes of text and
biological sequence analysis. This allows kernel
based techniques (such as SVMs) to be used in
lieu of traditional probabilistic approaches based
on Markov chains. In comparison to the latter,
SVMs have the advantage of directly optimising
the discrimination criterion.
This paper has four main aims: (i) to evalu-
ate the usefulness of sequence kernel based ap-
proaches for the task of authorship attribution;
(ii) to compare their performance with two prob-
abilistic approaches based on Markov chains of
characters and words; (iii) to appraise the applica-
bility of the author unmasking approach for deal-
ing with short texts; and (iv) to address some of
the limitations of the previous studies.
Several configurations of the sequence kernels
are studied. The evaluations are done on a rela-
tively large dataset (50 authors) where each author
covers several topics. Rather than using long texts
(such as books), in almost all of the experiments
the amount of training and test material per author
is varied from approx. 300 to 5000 words for both
cases. Moreover, rather than using a closed set
identification setup, the evaluations are done using
a verification setup. Here, a given text material is
classified as either having been written by a hy-
pothesised author or as not written by that author
(i.e. a two class discrimination task).
The paper is structured as follows. Section 2
describes author attribution systems based on
Markov chains of characters and words, followed
by a description of the corresponding sequence
kernel based approaches in Section 3. Section 4
provides an empirical performance comparison of
the abovementioned approaches, while in Sec-
tion 5 the author unmasking method is appraised.
Section 6 concludes the paper by presenting the
main findings and suggesting future directions.
2 Markov Chain Based Approaches
The opinion on how likely a given text X was writ-
ten by author A, rather than any other author, can
be found by a log likelihood ratio:
OA,G (X) = |ez(X)|
?1 log [ pA (ez(X)) / pG (ez(X)) ]
where z ? {words, chars}, ez(X) extracts an ordered
set of items from X (where the items are either
words or characters, indicated by z), |ez(X)|?1 is
used as a normalisation for varying number of
items, while pA(ez(X)) and pG(ez(X)) estimate the
likelihood of the text having been written by au-
thor A and a generic author1, G, respectively.
Given a threshold t, text X is classified as hav-
ing been written by author A when OA,G (X) > t,
or as written by someone else when OA,G (X) ? t.
The |ez(X)|?1 normalisation term allows for the
use of a common threshold (i.e. shared by all au-
thors), which facilitates the interpretation of per-
formance (e.g. via the use of the Equal Error Rate
(EER) point on a Receiver Operating Characteris-
tic (ROC) curve (Ortega-Garcia et al, 2004)).
Appropriating a technique originally used in
language modelling (Chen and Goodman, 1999),
the likelihood of author A having written a partic-
ular sequence of items, X =
`
i1, i2, ? ? ? , i|X|
?
, can
be approximated using the joint probability of all
present m-th order Markov chains:
pA (X) ?
Y|X|
j=(m+1)
pA
?
ij |i
j?1
j?m
?
(1)
where ij?1j?m is a shorthand for ij?m ? ? ? ij?1 and m
indicates the length of the history. Given train-
ing material for author A, denoted as XA, the max-
imum likelihood (ML) probability estimate for a
particular m-th order Markov chain is:
pmlA
?
ij |i
j?1
j?m
?
= C
?
ijj?m|XA
?
/ C
?
ij?1j?m|XA
?
(2)
where C
`
ijj?m|XA
?
is the number of times the se-
quence ijj?m occurs in XA. For chains that have
not been seen during training, elaborate smooth-
ing techniques (Chen and Goodman, 1999) are
utilised to avoid zero probabilities in Eqn. (1).
The probabilities for the generic author are es-
timated from a dataset comprised of texts from
many authors.
In this work we utilise interpolated Moffat
smoothing2, where the probability of an m-th or-
1A generic author is a composite of a number of authors.
2Moffat smoothing is often mistakenly referred to as
Witten-Bell smoothing. Witten & Bell (1991) referred to this
technique as Method C and cited Moffat (1988).

?
? is the number of
unique (m+1)-grams that have the same ij?1j?m his-
tory items. Further elucidation of this method is
given in (Chen and Goodman, 1999; Witten and
Bell, 1991).
The (m-1)-th order probability will typically
correlate with the m-th order probability and has
the advantage of being estimated from a larger
number of examples (Chen and Goodman, 1999).
The 0-th order probability is interpolated with the
uniform distribution, given by: punifA = 1/ |VA|,
where |VA| is the vocabulary size (Chen and Good-
man, 1999).
When an m-th order chain has a history (i.e. the
items ij?1j?m) which hasn?t been observed during
training, a back-off to the corresponding reduced
order chain is done3:
if C
?
ij?1j?m|XA
?
= 0, pmofA
?
ij |i
j?1
j?m
?
= pmofA
?
ij |i
j?1
j?(m?1)
?
Note that if the 0-th order chain also hasn?t been
observed during training, we are effectively back-
ing off to the uniform distribution.
A caveat: the training dataset for an author can
be much smaller (and hence have a smaller vo-
cabulary) than the combined training dataset for
the generic author, resulting in punifA > p
unif
G . Thus
when a previously unseen chain is encountered
there is a dangerous bias towards author A, i.e.,
pmofA
`
ij |i
j?1
j?m
?
> pmofG
`
ij |i
j?1
j?m
?
. To avoid this, punifA
must be set equal to punifG .
3 Sequence Kernel Based Approaches
Kernel based techniques, such as SVMs, allow the
comparison of, and discrimination between, vec-
torial as well as non-vectorial objects. In a binary
SVM, the opinion on whether object X belongs to
class -1 or +1 is given by:
O+1,?1(X) =
X|S|
j=1
?j yj k(sj , X) + b (3)
where k(XA, XB) is a symmetric kernel function
which reflects the degree of similarity between

objects XA and XB, while S = (sj)|S|j=1 is a set
of support objects with corresponding class labels
(yj ? {?1,+1} )
|S|
j=1 and weights ? = (?j)
|S|
j=1. The
kernel function, b as well as sets S and ? define a
hyperplane which separates the +1 and -1 classes.
Given a training dataset, quadratic programming
based optimisation is used to maximise the separa-
tion margin4 (Scho?lkopf and Smola, 2002; Shawe-
Taylor and Cristianini, 2004).
Recently, kernels for measuring the similarity of
texts based on sequences of characters and words
have been proposed (Cancedda et al, 2003; Leslie
et al, 2004; Vishwanathan and Smola, 2003). One
kernel belonging to this family is:
k(XA, XB) =
X
q?Q?
wq C(q|XA) C(q|XB) (4)
where Q? represents all possible sequences,
in XA and XB, of the symbols in Q. In turn,
Q is a set of possible symbols, which can be
characters, e.g. Q = { ?a?, ?b?, ?c?, ? ? ? }, or words,
e.g. Q = {?kangaroo?, ?koala?, ?platypus?, ? ? ? }.
Furthermore, C(q|X) is the number of occurrences
of sequence q in X, and wq is the weight for
sequence q. If the sequences are restricted to have
only one item, Eqn. (4) for the case of words is
in effect a bag-of-words kernel (Cancedda et al,
2003; Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004).
In this work we have utilised weights that were
dependent only on the length of each sequence,
i.e. wq = w|q|. By default w|q| = 0, modified by one
of the following functions:
specific length: w|q| = 1, if |q| = ?
bounded range: w|q| = 1, if |q| ? [1, ? ]
bounded linear decay: w|q| = 1 + 1?|q|? , if |q| ? [1, ? ]
bounded linear growth: w|q| = |q| / ? , if |q| ? [1, ? ]
where ? indicates a user defined maximum se-
quence length.
To allow comparison of texts with different
lengths, a normalised version (Scho?lkopf and
Smola, 2002; Shawe-Taylor and Cristianini, 2004)
of the kernel can be used:
bk(XA, XB) = k(XA, XB) /
p
k(XA, XA) k(XB , XB)
with constraints |XA| ? 1 and |XB | ? 1.
It has been suggested that SVM discrimina-
tion based on character sequence kernels in effect
utilises a noisy version of stemming (Cancedda
et al, 2003). As such, word sequence kernels
could be more effective than character sequence

constant C, used in SVM training, was set to 100.
484
kernels, since proper word stems, instead of full
words, can be explicitly used. However, it must
be noted that Eqn. (4) implicitly maps texts to a
feature space which has one dimension for each
of the possible sequences comprised of the sym-
bols from Q (Cancedda et al, 2003). When us-
ing words, the number of unique symbols (i.e. |Q|)
can be much greater than when using characters
(e.g. 10,000 vs 100); furthermore, for a given
text the number of words is always smaller than
the number of characters. For a given sequence
length, these observations indicate that for word
sequence kernels the implicit feature space repre-
sentation can have considerably higher dimension-
ality and be sparser than for character sequence
kernels, which could lead to poorer generalisation
of the resulting classifier.
4 Evaluation
4.1 ?Columnists? Dataset
We have compiled a dataset that is comprised of
texts from 50 newspaper journalists, with a min-
imum of 10,000 words per journalist. Journalists
were selected based on their coverage of several
topics; any journalist who covered only one spe-
cific area (e.g. sports or economics) was not in-
cluded in the dataset. Apart from removing all
advertising material and standardising the repre-
sentation by converting any unicode characters to
their closest ASCII counterparts, no further edit-
ing was performed. The dataset is available for
use by other researchers by contacting the authors.
4.2 Setup
The experiments followed a verification setup,
where a given text material was classified as ei-
ther having been written by a hypothesised author
or as not written by that author (i.e. a two class
discrimination task). This is distinct from a closed
set identification setup, where a text is assigned as
belonging to one author out of a pool of authors.
The presentation of an impostor text (a text known

the number of characters and number of words.
For comparison purposes, this paper has about
5900 words.
No. characters 1750 3500 7000 14000 28000
No. words 312 625 1250 2500 5000
not to be written by the hypothesised author) will
be referred to as an impostor claim, while the pre-
sentation of a true text (a text known to be written
by the hypothesised author) will be referred to as
a true claim.
For a given text, one of the following two classi-
fication errors can occur: (i) a false positive, where
an impostor text is incorrectly classified as a true
text; (ii) a false negative, where a true text is in-
correctly classified as an impostor text. The er-
rors are measured in terms of the false positive rate
(FPR) and the false negative rate (FNR). Follow-
ing the approach often used within the biometrics
field, the decision threshold was then adjusted so
that the FPR is equal to the FNR, giving Equal Er-
ror Rate (EER) performance (Ortega-Garcia et al,
2004; Sanderson et al, 2006).
The authors in the database were randomly as-
signed into two disjoint sections: (i) 10 back-
ground authors; (ii) 40 evaluation authors. For
the case of Markov chain approaches, texts from
the background authors were used to construct the
generic author model, while for kernel based ap-
proaches they were used to represent the negative
class. In both cases, text materials each comprised
of approx. 28,000 characters were used, via ran-
domly choosing a sufficient number of sentences
from the pooled texts. Table 1 shows a corre-
spondence between the number of characters and
words, using the average word length of 5.6 char-
acters including a trailing whitespace (found on
the whole dataset).
For each author in the evaluation section, their
material was randomly split5 into two continuous
parts: training and testing. The split occurred
without breaking sentences. The training material
was used to construct the author model, while the
test material was used to simulate a true claim as
well as impostor claims against all other authors?
models. Note that if material from the evaluation
section was used for constructing the generic au-
thor model, the system would have prior knowl-
edge about the writing style of the authors used
for the impostor claims.
For each configuration of an approach (where,
for example, the configuration is the order of the
Markov chains), the above procedure was repeated
ten times, with the randomised assignments and
splitting being done each time. The final results

were then obtained in terms of the mean and the
corresponding standard deviation of the ten EERs
(the standard deviations are shown as error bars
in the result figures). Based on preliminary ex-
periments, stemming was used for word based ap-
proaches (Manning and Schu?tze, 1999).
4.3 Experiments and Discussion
In the first experiment we studied the effects of
varying the order for character and word Markov
chain approaches, while the amount of training
material was fixed at approx. 28,000 characters
and the test material (for evaluation authors) was
decreased from approx. 28,000 to 1,750 charac-
ters. Results are presented in Fig. 1.
The results show that 2nd order chains of
characters generally obtain the best performance.
However, the difference in performance between
1st order and 2nd order chains could be considered
as statistically insignificant due to the large over-
lap of the error bars. The best performing word
chain approach had an order of zero, with higher
orders (not shown) having virtually the same per-
formance as the 0th order. Its performance is
largely similar to the 2nd order character chain ap-
proach, with the latter obtaining a somewhat lower
error rate at 28,000 characters.
The second experiment was similar to the first,
with the difference being that the amount of train-
ing material and test material was decreased from
approx. 28,000 to 1,750 characters. The main
change between the results of this experiment
(shown in Fig. 2) and the previous experiment?s
results is the faster degradation in performance as
the number of characters is decreased. We com-
ment on this effect later.
In the third experiment we utilised SVMs with
character sequence kernels and studied the effects
of chunk size. As SVMs employ support ob-
jects in the definition of the discriminant function
(see Section 3), the training material was split into
varying size chunks, ranging from approximately
62 to 4000 characters. Each of the chunks can be-
come a support chunk. Naturally, the smaller the
chunk size, the larger the number of chunks. As
the split was done without breaking sentences, the
effective chunk size tended to be somewhat larger.
If there is less words available than a given chunk
size, then all of the remaining words are used for
forming a chunk. Based on preliminary experi-
ments, the bounded range weight function with

size is approximately 500 characters for the three
cases. Furthermore, the optimum chunk size ap-

In the fourth experiment we studied the ef-
fects of various weight functions and sequence
lengths for the character sequence kernel. The
amount of training and test material was fixed at
approx. 28,000 characters. Based on the results
from the previous experiment, chunk size was set
at 500. Results for specific length (Fig. 4) suggest
that most of the reliable discriminatory informa-
tion is contained in sequences of length 2. The

ear decay functions are quite similar, with both
reaching minima for sequences of length 4; most
of the improvement occurs when the sequences
reach a length of 3. This indicates that while se-
quences with a specific length of 3 and 4 are less
reliable than sequences with a specific length of
2, they contain (partly) complementary informa-
tion which is useful when combined with infor-
mation from shorter lengths. Emphasising longer
lengths of 5 and 6 (via the bounded linear growth
function) achieves a minor, but noticeable, perfor-
mance degradation. We conjecture that the degra-
dation is caused by the sparsity of relatively long
sequences, which affects the generalisation of the
classifier.

quence approach. To keep the results comparable
with the character sequence approach (third exper-
iment), the training material was split into vary-
ing size chunks, ranging from approximately 62
to 8000 characters. Based on the results from the
first experiment, the specific length weight func-
tion with ?=1 was used6 (resulting in a bag-of-
words kernel).
The amount of training and test material was
equal and three cases were evaluated: 28,000,
14,000 and 7,000 characters. Results, shown in
Fig. 5, suggest that the optimum chunk size is ap-
proximately 4000 characters for the three cases.
As mentioned in Section 3, for the word based
approach the implicit feature space representation
can have considerably higher dimensionality and
be sparser than for the character based approach.
Consequently, longer texts would be required to
adequately populate the feature space. This is re-
flected by the optimum chunk size for the word
based approach, which is roughly an order of mag-
nitude larger than the optimum chunk size for the
character based approach.
In the sixth experiment we compared the per-
formance of character sequence kernels (using
the bounded range function with ?=4) and sev-
eral configurations of the word sequence kernels.
The amount of training material was fixed at ap-
prox. 28,000 characters and the test material was
decreased from approx. 28,000 to 1,750 charac-
ters. Based on the results of previous experi-
ments, chunk size was set to 500 for the charac-
ter based approach and to 4000 for the word based

approach. Fig. 6 shows that word sequences with
a specific length of 2 lead to considerably worse
performance than sequences of length 1 (i.e. indi-
vidual words). Furthermore, the best performing
combination of lengths (i.e. via the bounded linear
decay function7) does not provide better perfor-
mance than using individual words. The charac-
ter sequence kernels consistently achieve a lower
error rate than the best performing word sequence
kernel. This suggests that the sparse feature space
representation, described in Section 3, is becom-
ing an issue.
The final experiment was similar to the sixth,
with the difference being that the amount of train-
ing material and test material was decreased from
approx. 28,000 to 1,750 characters. As observed
for the Markov chain approaches, the main change
between the results of this experiment (shown in
Fig. 7) and the previous experiment?s results is the
faster degradation in performance as the number
of characters is decreased. Along with the results
from experiments 1 and 2, this indicates that the
amount of training material has considerably more
influence on discrimination performance than the
amount of test material.
In Fig. 8 it can be observed that the best per-
forming Markov chain based approach (charac-
ters, 2nd order) obtains comparable performance
to the character sequence kernel based approach
(using the bounded range function with ?=4).

5 Author Unmasking On Short Texts
Koppel & Schler (2004) proposed an alternative
method for author verification. Rather than treat-
ing the verification problem directly as a two-class
discrimination task (as done in Section 4), an ?au-
thor unmasking? curve is first built. A vector rep-
resenting the ?essential features? of the curve is
then classified in a traditional SVM setting. The
unmasking procedure is reminiscent of the recur-
sive feature elimination procedure first proposed
in the context of gene selection for cancer classifi-
cation (Guyon et al, 2002).
Instead of having an author specific model (as
in the Markov chain approach) or an author spe-
cific SVM, a reference text is used. The text to be

classified as well as the reference text are divided
into chunks; the features representing each chunk
are the counts of pre-selected words. Each point in
the author unmasking curve is the cross-validation
accuracy of discriminating between the two sets
of chunks (using a linear SVM). At each iteration,
several of the most discriminative features are re-
moved from further consideration.
The underlying hypothesis is that if the two
given texts have been written by the same author,
the differences between them will be reflected in
a relatively small number of features. Koppel &
Schler (2004) observed that for texts authored by
the same person, the extent of the cross-validation
accuracy degradation is much larger than for texts
written by different authors. Encouraging classifi-
cation results were obtained for long texts (books
available from Project Gutenberg8).
In this section we first confirm the unmasking
effect for long texts and then show that for shorter
texts (i.e. approx. 5000 words), the effect is con-
siderably less distinctive.
For the first experiment we followed the setup
in (Koppel and Schler, 2004), i.e. the same books,
chunks with a size of approximately 500 words,
10 fold cross-validation, removing 6 features at
each iteration, and using 250 words with the high-
est average frequency in both texts as the set of
pre-selected words. Fig. 9 shows curves for un-
masking Oscar Wilde?s An Ideal Husband using
Wilde?s Woman of No Importance (same-author
curve) as well as the works of other authors as
reference texts (different-author curves). As can

be observed, the unmasking effect is most pro-
nounced for Wilde?s text. Furthermore, this figure
has a close resemblance to Fig. 2 in (Koppel and
Schler, 2004).
In the second experiment we used text mate-
rials from the Columnists dataset. Each author?s
text material was divided into two sections of ap-
proximately 5000 words, with the one of the sec-
tions randomly selected to be the reference mate-
rial, leaving the other as the test material. Based
on preliminary experiments, the number of pre-
selected words was set to 100 (with the highest
average frequency in both texts) and the size of
the chunks was set to 200 words. The remainder
of the unmasking procedure setup was the same as
for the first experiment. The setup for verification
trials was similar to the setup in Section 4.2, with
the difference being that the background authors
were used to generate same-author and different-
author curves for training the secondary SVM. In
all cases features from each curve were extracted,
as done in (Koppel and Schler, 2004), prior to fur-
ther processing.

formance of the unmasking approach with that

Markov chain based approaches, as evaluated in
Section 4. Fig. 10 shows representative curves re-
sulting from unmasking of the test material from
author A, using A?s as well as other authors? refer-
ence materials. Generally, the unmasking effect
for the same-author curves is considerably less
pronounced and in some cases it is non-existent.
More dangerously, different-author curves often
have close similarities to same-author curves. The
results and the above observations hence suggest
that the unmasking method is less useful when
dealing with relatively short texts.
6 Main Findings and Future Directions
In this paper we investigated the use of charac-
ter and word sequence kernels for the task of
authorship attribution and compared their perfor-
mance with two probabilistic approaches based on
Markov chains of characters and words. The eval-
uations were done on a relatively large dataset (50
authors), where each author covered several top-
ics. Rather than using the restrictive closed set
identification setup, a verification setup was used
which takes into account the realistic case of texts
which are not written by any hypothesised authors.
We also appraised the applicability of the recently
proposed author unmasking approach for dealing
with relatively short texts.
In the framework of Support Vector Machines,
several configurations of the sequence kernels
were studied, showing that word sequence ker-
nels do not achieve better performance than a bag-
of-words kernel. Character sequence kernels (us-
ing sequences with a length of 4) generally have
better performance than the bag-of-words kernel
and also have comparable performance to the two
probabilistic approaches.
A possible advantage of character sequence ker-
nels over word-based kernels is their inherent abil-
ity to do partial matching of words. Let us con-
sider two examples. (i) Given the words ?negotia-
tion? and ?negotiate?, the character sequence ker-
nel can match ?negotiat?, while a standard word-
based kernel requires explicit word stemming be-
forehand in order to match the two related words
(as done in our experiments). (ii) Given the
words ?negotiation? and ?desalination?, a charac-
ter sequence kernel can match the common ending
?ation?. Particular word endings may be indica-
tive of a particular author?s style; such information
would not be picked up by a standard word-based
kernel.
Interestingly, the bag-of-words kernel based ap-
proach obtains worse performance than the cor-
responding word based Markov chain approach.
Apart from the issue of sparse feature space rep-
resentation, factors such as the chunk size and the
setting of the C parameter in SVM training can
also affect the generalisation performance.
The results also show that the amount of train-
ing material has more influence on discrimina-
tion performance than the amount of test material;
about 5000 training words are required to obtain
relatively good performance when using between
1250 and 5000 test words.
Further experiments suggest that the author un-
masking approach is less useful when dealing with
relatively short texts, due to the unmasking effect
being considerably less pronounced than for long
texts and also due to different-author unmasking
curves having close similarities to the same-author
curves.
In future work it would be useful to appraise
composite kernels (Joachims et al, 2001) in or-
der to combine character and word sequence ker-
nels. If the two kernel types use (partly) com-
plementary information, better performance could
be achieved. Furthermore, more sophisticated
character sequence kernels can be evaluated, such
as mismatch string kernels used in bioinformat-
ics, where mutations in the sequences are al-
lowed (Leslie et al, 2004).
