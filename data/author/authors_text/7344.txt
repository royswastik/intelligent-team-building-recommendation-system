Abstract
Text document clustering can greatly simplify
browsing large collections of documents by re-
organizing them into a smaller number of man-
ageable clusters. Algorithms to solve this task
exist; however, the algorithms are only as good
as the data they work on. Problems include am-
biguity and synonymy, the former allowing for
erroneous groupings and the latter causing sim-
ilarities between documents to go unnoticed. In
this research, na??ve, syntax-based disambigua-
tion is attempted by assigning each word a
part-of-speech tag and by enriching the ?bag-of-
words? data representation often used for docu-
ment clustering with synonyms and hypernyms
from WordNet.
1 Introduction
Text document clustering is the grouping of text
documents into semantically related groups, or
as Hayes puts it, ?they are grouped because they
are likely to be wanted together?(Hayes, 1963).
Initially, document clustering was developed to
improve precision and recall of information re-
trieval systems. More recently, however, driven
by the ever increasing amount of text docu-
ments available in corporate document reposi-
tories and on the Internet, the focus has shifted
towards providing ways to efficiently browse
large collections of documents and to reorganise
search results for display in a structured, often
hierarchical manner.
The clustering of Internet search results has
attracted particular attention. Some recent
studies explored the feasibility of clustering ?in
real-time? and the problem of adequately label-
ing clusters. Zamir and Etzioni (1999) have
created a clustering interface for the meta-
search engine ?HuskySearch? and Zhang and
Dong (2001) present their work on a system
called SHOC. The reader is also referred to
Vivisimo,1 a commercial clustering interface
based on results from a number of search-
engines.
Ways to increase clustering speed are ex-
plored in many research papers, and the recent
trend towards web-based clustering, requiring
real-time performance, does not seem to change
this. However, van Rijsbergen points out, ?it
seems to me a little early in the day to insist on
efficiency even before we know much about the
behaviour of clustered files in terms of the ef-
fectiveness of retrieval? (van Rijsbergen, 1989).
Indeed, it may be worth exploring which factors
influence the quality (or effectiveness) of docu-
ment clustering.
Clustering can be broken down into two
stages. The first one is to preprocess the doc-
uments, i.e. transforming the documents into
a suitable and useful data representation. The
second stage is to analyse the prepared data and
divide it into clusters, i.e. the clustering algo-
rithm.
Steinbach et al (2000) compare the suitabil-
ity of a number of algorithms for text clustering
and conclude that bisecting k-means, a parti-
tional algorithm, is the current state-of-the-art.
Its processing time increases linearly with the
number of documents and its quality is similar
to that of hierarchical algorithms.
Preprocessing the documents is probably at
least as important as the choice of an algorithm,
since an algorithm can only be as good as the
data it works on. While there are a number of
preprocessing steps, that are almost standard
now, the effects of adding background knowl-
edge are still not very extensively researched.
This work explores if and how the two following
methods can improve the effectiveness of clus-
tering.
1http://www.vivisimo.com
Part-of-Speech Tagging. Segond et al
(1997) observe that part-of-speech tagging
(PoS) solves semantic ambiguity to some
extent (40% in one of their tests). Based
on this observation, we study whether
na??ve word sense disambiguation by PoS
tagging can help to improve clustering
results.
WordNet. Synonymy and hypernymy can re-
veal hidden similarities, potentially leading
to better clusters. WordNet,2 an ontology
which models these two relations (among
many others) (Miller et al, 1991), is used
to include synonyms and hypernyms in the
data representation and the effects on clus-
tering quality are observed and analysed.
The overall aim of the approach outlined above
is to cluster documents by meaning, hence it
is relevant to language understanding. The ap-
proach has some of the characteristics expected
from a robust language understanding system.
Firstly, learning only relies on unannoted text
data, which is abundant and does not contain
the individual bias of an annotator. Secondly,
the approach is based on general-purpose re-
sources (Brill?s PoS Tagger, WordNet), and the
performance is studied under pessimistic (hence
more realistic) assumptions, e.g., that the tag-
ger is trained on a standard dataset with poten-
tially different properties from the documents
to be clustered. Similarly, the approach studies
the potential benefits of using all possible senses
(and hypernyms) from WordNet, in an attempt
to postpone (or avoid altogether) the need for
Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD), and the re-
lated pitfalls of a WSD tool which may be biased
towards a specific domain or language style.
The remainder of the document is structured
as follows. Section 2 describes related work
and the techniques used to preprocess the data,
as well as cluster it and evaluate the results
achieved. Section 3 provides some background
on the selected corpus, the Reuters-21578 test
collection (Lewis, 1997b), and presents the sub-
corpora that are extracted for use in the exper-
iments. Section 4 describes the experimental
framework, while Section 5 presents the results
and their evaluation. Finally, conclusions are
drawn and further work discussed in Section 6.

2 Background
This work is most closely related to the recently
published research of Hotho et al (2003b), and
can be seen as a logical continuation of their ex-
periments. While these authors have analysed
the benefits of using WordNet synonyms and up
to five levels of hypernyms for document clus-
tering (using the bisecting k-means algorithm),
this work describes the impact of tagging the
documents with PoS tags and/or adding all hy-
pernyms to the information available for each
document.
Here we use the vector space model, as de-
scribed in the work of Salton et al (1975), in
which a document is represented as a vector or
?bag of words?, i.e., by the words it contains
and their frequency, regardless of their order.
A number of fairly standard techniques have
been used to preprocess the data. In addition,
a combination of standard and custom software
tools have been used to add PoS tags and Word-
Net categories to the data set. These will be
described briefly below to allow for the experi-
ments to be repeated.
The first preprocessing step is to PoS tag the
corpus. The PoS tagger relies on the text struc-
ture and morphological differences to determine
the appropriate part-of-speech. For this reason,
if it is required, PoS tagging is the first step
to be carried out. After this, stopword removal
is performed, followed by stemming. This or-
der is chosen to reduce the amount of words
to be stemmed. The stemmed words are then
looked up in WordNet and their correspond-
ing synonyms and hypernyms are added to the
bag-of-words. Once the document vectors are
completed in this way, the frequency of each
word across the corpus can be counted and ev-
ery word occurring less often than the pre speci-
fied threshold is pruned. Finally, after the prun-
ing step, the term weights are converted to tf idf
as described below.
Stemming, stopword removal and pruning all
aim to improve clustering quality by removing
noise, i.e. meaningless data. They all lead to
a reduction in the number of dimensions in the
term-space. Weighting is concerned with the es-
timation of the importance of individual terms.
All of these have been used extensively and are
considered the baseline for comparison in this
work. However, the two techniques under in-
vestigation both add data to the representa-
tion. PoS tagging adds syntactic information
and WordNet is used to add synonyms and hy-
pernyms. The rest of this section discusses pre-
processing, clustering and evaluation in more
detail.
PoS Tagging PoS tags are assigned to the
corpus using Brill?s PoS tagger. As PoS tagging
requires the words to be in their original order
this is done before any other modifications on
the corpora.
Stopword Removal Stopwords, i.e. words
thought not to convey any meaning, are re-
moved from the text. The approach taken in
this work does not compile a static list of stop-
words, as usually done. Instead PoS informa-
tion is exploited and all tokens that are not
nouns, verbs or adjectives are removed.
Stemming Words with the same meaning ap-
pear in various morphological forms. To cap-
ture their similarity they are normalised into
a common root-form, the stem. The morphol-
ogy function provided with WordNet is used for
stemming, because it only yields stems that are
contained in the WordNet dictionary.
WordNet Categories WordNet, the lexical
database developed by Miller et al, is used to
include background information on each word.
Depending on the experiment setup, words are
replaced with their synset IDs, which constitute
their different possible senses, and also different
levels of hypernyms, more general terms for the
a word, are added.
Pruning Words appearing with low fre-
quency throughout the corpus are unlikely to
appear in more than a handful of documents
and would therefore, even if they contributed
any discriminating power, be likely to cause too
fine grained distinctions for us to be useful, i.e
clusters containing only one or two documents.
Therefore all words (or synset IDs) that ap-
pear less often than a pre-specified threshold are
pruned.
Weighting Weights are assigned to give an
indication of the importance of a word. The
most trivial weight is the word-frequency. How-
ever, more sophisticated methods can provide
better results. Throughout this work, tf idf
(term frequency x inverse document frequency)
as described by Salton et al (1975), is used.
One problem with term frequency is that the
lengths of the documents are not taken into ac-
count. The straight forward solution to this
problem is to divide the term frequency by the
total number of terms in the document, the
document length. Effectively, this approach is
equivalent to normalising each document vector
to length one and is called relative term fre-
quency.
However, for this research a more sophisti-
cated measure is used: the product of term fre-
quency and inverse document frequency tf idf.
Salton et al define the inverse document fre-
quency idf as
idf
t
= log
2
n ? log
2
df
t
+ 1 (1)
where df
t
is the number of documents in which
term t appears and n the total number of doc-
uments. Consequently, the tf idf measure is cal-
culated as
tf idf
t
= tf ? (log
2
n ? log
2
df
t
+ 1) (2)
simply the multiplication of tf and idf . This
means that larger weights are assigned to terms
that appear relatively rarely throughout the
corpus, but very frequently in individual doc-
uments. Salton et al (1975) measure a 14%
improvement in recall and precision for tf idf in
comparison to the standard term frequency tf.
Clustering is done with the bisecting k-
means algorithm as it is described by Stein-
bach et al (2000). In their comparison of
different algorithms they conclude that bisect-
ing k-means is the current state of the art for
document clustering. Bisecting k-means com-
bines the strengths of partitional and hierarchi-
cal clustering methods by iteratively splitting
the biggest cluster using the basic k-means algo-
rithm. Basic k-means is a partitional clustering
algorithm based on the vector space model. At
the heart of such algorithms is a similarity mea-
sure. We choose the cosine distance, which mea-
sures the similarity of two documents by cal-
culating the cosine of the angle between them.
The cosine distance is defined as follows:
s(d
i
, d
j
) = cos((d
i
, d
j
)) =
d
i
?
d
j
|
d
i
| ? |
d
j
|
(3)
where |d
i
| and |d
j
| are the lengths of vectors
d
i
and d
j
, respectively, and d
i
?
d
j
is the dot-
product of the two vectors. When the lengths of
the vectors are normalised, the cosine distance
is equivalent to the dot-product of the vectors,
i.e. d
1
?
d
2
.
Evaluation Three different evaluation mea-
sures are used in this work, namely purity, en-
tropy and overall similarity. Purity and entropy
are both based on precision,
prec(C,L) := |C ? L|
|C| , (4)
where each cluster C from a clustering C of the
set of documents D is compared with the man-
ually assigned category labels L from the man-
ual categorisation L, which requires a category-
labeled corpus. Precision is the probability of a
document in cluster C being labeled L.
Purity is the percentage of correctly clustered
documents and can be calculated as:
purity(C, L) :=
?
C?C
|C|
|D| ? maxL?L prec(C,L) (5)
yielding values in the range between 0 and 1.
The intra-cluster entropy (ice) of a cluster C,
as described by Steinbach et al (2000), consid-
ers the dispersion of documents in a cluster, and
is defined as:
ice(C) :=
?
L?L
prec(C,L) ? log(prec(C,L)) (6)
Based on the intra-cluster entropy of all clus-
ters, the average, weighted by the cluster size,
is calculated. This results in the following for-
mula, which is based on the one used by Stein-
bach et al (2000):
entropy(C) :=
?
C?C
|C|
|D| ? ice(C) (7)
Overall similarity is independent of pre-
annotation. Instead the intra-cluster similari-
ties are calculated, giving an idea of the cohe-
siveness of a cluster. This is the average similar-
ity between each pair of documents in a cluster,
including the similarity of a document with it-
self. Steinbach et al (2000) show that this is
equivalent to the squared length of the cluster
centroid, i.e. |c|2. The overall similarity is then
calculated as
overall similarity(C) :=
?
C?C
|C|
|D| ? |c|
2 (8)
Similarity is expressed as a percentage, there-
fore the possible values for overall similarity
range from 0 to 1.
3 The Corpus
Here we look at what kind of corpus is required
to assess the quality of clusters, and present
our choice, the Reuters-21578 test collection.
This is followed by a discussion of the ways sub-
corpora can be extracted from the whole corpus
in order to address some of the problems of the
Reuters corpus.
A corpus useful for evaluating text document
clustering needs to be annotated with class or
category labels. This is not a straightforward
task, as even human annotators sometimes dis-
agree on which label to assign to a specific doc-
ument. Therefore, all results depend on the
quality of annotation. It is therefore unrealis-
tic to aim at high rates of agreement with re-
gard to the corpus, and any evaluation should
rather focus on the relative comparison of the
results achieved by different experiment setups
and configurations.
Due to the aforementioned difficulty of agree-
ing on a categorisation and the lack of a defini-
tion of ?correct? classification, no standard cor-
pora for evaluation of clustering techniques ex-
ist. Still, although not standardised, a number
of pre-categorised corpora are available. Apart
from various domain-specific corpora with class
annotations, there is the Reuters-21578 test col-
lection (Lewis, 1997b), which consists of 21578
newswire articles from 1987.
The Reuters corpus is chosen for use in the
experiments of this projects for four reasons.
1. Its domain is not specific, therefore it can
be understood by a non-expert.
2. WordNet, an ontology, which is not tailored
to a specific domain, would not be effective
for domains with a very specific vocabulary.
3. It is freely available for download.
4. It has been used in comparable studies be-
fore (Hotho et al, 2003b).
On closer inspection of the corpus, there re-
main some problems to solve. First of all, only
about half of the documents are annotated with
category-labels. On the other hand some doc-
uments are attributed to multiple categories,
meaning that categories overlap. Some confu-
sion seems to have been caused in the research
community by the fact that there is a TOPICS
attribute in the SGML, the value of which is ei-
ther set to YES or NO (or BYPASS). However,
this does not correspond to the values observed
within the TOPICS tag; sometimes categories
can be found, even if the TOPICS attribute is
set to NO and sometimes there are no categories
assigned, even if the attribute indicates YES.
Lewis explains that this is not an error in the
corpus, but has to do with the evolution of the
corpus and is kept for historic reasons (Lewis,
1997a).
Therefore, to prepare a base-corpus, the
TOPICS attribute is ignored and all documents
that have precisely one category assigned to
them are selected. Additionally, all documents
with an empty document body are also dis-
carded. This results in the corpus ?reut-base?
containing 9446 documents. The distribution
of category sizes in the ?reut-base? is shown in
Figure 1. It illustrates that there are a few cat-
egories occurring extremely often, in fact the
two biggest categories contain about two thirds
of all documents in the corpus. This unbal-
anced distribution would blur test results, be-
cause even ?random clustering? would poten-
tially obtain purity values of 30% and more only
due to the contribution of the two main cate-
gories.

Figure 1: Category Distribution for Corpus
?reut-base? (only selected categories are listed).
Similar to Hotho et al (2003b), we get around
this problem by deriving new corpora from the
base corpus. Their maximum category size is
reduced to 20, 50 and 100 documents respec-
tively. Categories containing more documents
are not excluded, but instead they are reduced
in size to comply with the defined maximum,
i.e., all documents in excess of the maximum
are removed.
Creating derived corpora has the further ad-
vantages of reducing the size of corpora and thus
computational requirements for the test runs.
Also, tests can be run on more and less homo-
geneous corpora, homogeneous with regard to
the cluster size, that is, which can give an idea
of how the method performs under different con-
ditions. Especially for this purpose a fourth, ex-
tremely homogeneous test corpus, ?reut-min15-
max20? is derived. It is like the ?reut-max20?
corpus, but all categories containing less than
15 documents are entirely removed. The ?reut-
min15-max20? is thus the most homogeneous
test corpus, with a standard deviation in cluster
size of only 0.7 documents.
A summary of the derived test corpora is
shown in Table 1, including the number of doc-
uments they contain, i.e. their size, the average
category size and the standard deviation. Fig-
ure 2 shows the distribution of categories within
the derived corpora graphically.
Table 1: Corpus Statistics

reut-max100 2244 34 35.2
reut-base 9446 143 553.2
Note: The average category size is rounded to the nearest
whole number, the standard deviation to the first decimal
place.
4 Clustering with PoS and
Background Knowledge
The aim of this work is to explore the bene-
fits of partial disambiguation of words by their
PoS and the inclusion of WordNet concepts.
This has been tested on five different setups,
as shown in Table 2.
Table 2: Experiment Configurations

Baseline yes
PoS Only yes yes
Syns yes yes yes
Hyper 5 yes yes yes 5
Hyper All yes yes yes all
Base: stopword removal, stemming, pruning and tf idf weighting
are performed; PoS tags are stripped.

weighting. PoS tags are removed from the
tokens to get the equivalent of a raw text
corpus.
PoS Only Identical to the baseline, but the
PoS tags are not removed.
Syns In addition to the previous configuration,
all WordNet senses (synset IDs) of each
PoS tagged token are included.
Hyper 5 Here five levels of hypernyms are in-
cluded in addition to the synset IDs.
Hyper All Same as above, but all hypernyms
for each word token are included.
Each of the configurations is used to create
16, 32 and 64 clusters from each of the four
test-corpora. Due to the random choice of ini-
tial cluster centroids in the bisecting k-means
algorithm, the means of three test-runs with
the same configuration is calculated for corpora
?reut-max20? and ?reut-max50?. The existing
project time constraints allowed us to gain some
additional insight by doing one test-run for each
of ?reut-max100? and ?reut-min15-max20?. This
results in 120 experiments in total.
All configurations use tf idf weighting and
pruning. The pruning thresholds vary. For all
experiments using the ?reut-max20? corpus all
terms occurring less than 20 times are pruned.
The experiments on corpora ?reut-max50? and
?reut-min15-max20? are carried out with a prun-
ing threshold of 50. For the corpus ?reut-
max100?, the pruning threshold is set to 50
when configurations Baseline, PoS Only or
Syns are used and to 200 otherwise. This rel-
atively high threshold is chosen, in order to re-
duce memory requirements. To ensure that this
inconsistency does not distort the conclusions
drawn from the test data, the results of these
tests are considered with great care and are ex-
plicitly referred to when used.
Further details of this research are described
in an unpublished report (Sedding, 2004).
5 Results and Evaluation
The results are presented in the format of one
graph per corpus, showing the entropy, purity
and overall similarity values for each of the con-
figurations shown in Table 2.
On the X-axis, the different configuration set-
tings are listed. On the right-hand side, hype
refers to the hypernym depth, syn refers to
whether synonyms were included or not, pos
refers to the presence or absence of PoS tags
and clusters refers to the number of clusters cre-
ated. For improved readability, lines are drawn,
splitting the graphs into three sections, one for
each number of clusters. For experiments on
the corpora ?reut-max20? and ?reut-max50?, the
values in the graphs are the average of three
test runs, whereas for the corpora ?reut-min15-
max20? and ?reut-max100?, the values are those
obtained from a single test run.
The Y-axis indicates the numerical values for
each of the measures. Note that the values
for purity and similarity are percentages, and
thus limited to the range between 0 and 1. For
those two measures, higher values indicate bet-
ter quality. High entropy values, on the other
hand, indicate lower quality. Entropy values are
always greater than 0 and for the particular ex-
periments carried out, they never exceed 1.3.
In analysing the test results, the main focus is
on the data of corpora ?reut-max20? and ?reut-
max50?, shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4, re-
spectively. This data is more reliable, because
it is the average of repeated test runs. Figures
6?7 show the test data obtained from cluster-
ing the corpora ?reut-min15-max20? and ?reut-
max100?, respectively.
The fact that the purity and similarity values
are far from 100 percent is not unusual. In many
cases, not even human annotators agree on how
to categorise a particular document (Hotho et
al., 2003a). More importantly, the number of
categories are not adjusted to the number of la-
bels present in a corpus, which makes complete
agreement impossible.
All three measures indicate that the qual-
ity increases with the number of clusters. The
graph in Figure 5 illustrates this for the entropy
in ?reut-max50?. For any given configuration, it
appears that the decrease in entropy is almost
constant when the number of clusters increases.
This is easily explained by the average cluster
sizes, which decrease with an increasing number
of clusters; when clusters are smaller, the proba-
bility of having a high percentage of documents
with the same label in a cluster increases. This

becomes obvious when very small clusters are
looked at. For instance, the minimum purity
value for a cluster containing three documents
is 33 percent, for two documents it is 50 percent,
and, in the extreme case of a single document
per cluster, purity is always 100 percent.
The PoS Only experiment results in perfor-
mance, which is very similar to the Baseline,
and is sometimes a little better, sometimes a lit-
tle worse. This is expected, and the experiment
is included to allow for a more accurate inter-
pretation of the subsequent experiments using
synonyms and hypernyms.
A more interesting observation is that purity
and entropy values indicate better clusters for
Baseline than for any of the configurations us-
ing background knowledge from WordNet (i.e.
Syns, Hyper 5 and Hyper All). One possi-
ble conclusion is that adding background knowl-
edge is not helpful at all. However, the reasons
for the relatively poor performance could also
be due to the way the experiments are set up.
Therefore, a possible explanation for these re-
sults could be that the benefit of extra overlap
between documents, which the added synonyms
and hypernyms should provide, is outweighed
by the additional noise they create. WordNet
does often provide five or more senses for a
word, which means that for one correct sense
a number of incorrect senses are added, even if
the PoS tags eliminate some of them.
The overall similarity measure gives a differ-
ent indication. Its values appear to increase
for the cases where background knowledge is in-
cluded, especially when hypernyms are added.
Overall similarity is the weighted average of the
intra-cluster similarities of all clusters. So the
intra-cluster similarity actually increases with

added information. As similarity increases with
additional overlap, the overall similarity mea-
sure shows that additional overlap is achieved.
The main problem with the approach of
adding all synonyms and all hypernyms into
the document vectors seems to be the added
noise. The expectation that tf idf weighting
would take care of these quasi-random new con-
cepts is not met, but the results also indicate
possible improvements to this approach.

used, the correct sense of a word could be cho-
sen and only the hypernyms for the correct
sense of the word could be taken into account.
This should drastically reduce noise. The ben-
efit of the added ?correct? concepts would then
probably improve cluster quality. Hotho et al
(2003a) experimented successfully with simple
disambiguation strategies, e.g., they used only
the first sense provided by WordNet.
As an alternative to word-by-word disam-
biguation, a strategy to disambiguate based on
document vectors could be devised; after adding
all alternative senses of the terms, the least fre-
quent ones could be removed. This is similar
to pruning but would be done on a document
by document basis, rather than globally on the
whole corpus. The basis for this idea is that only
concepts that appear repeatedly in a document
contribute (significantly) to the meaning of the
document. It is important that this is done be-
fore hypernyms are added, especially when all
levels of hypernyms are added, because the most
general terms are bound to appear more often
than the more specific ones. This would lead
to lots of very similar, but meaningless bags of
words or bags of concepts.
Comparing Syns, Hyper 5 and Hyper All
with each other, in many cases Hyper 5 gives
the best results. A possible explanation could
again be the equilibrium between valuable in-
formation and noise that are added to the vec-
tor representations. From these results it seems
that there is a point where the amount of in-
formation added reaches its maximum benefit;
adding more knowledge afterwards results in
decreased cluster quality again. It should be
noted that a fixed threshold for the levels of hy-
pernyms used is unlikely to be optimal for all
words. Instead, a more refined approach could
set this threshold as a function of the semantic
distance (Resnik and Yarowsky, 2000; Stetina,
1997) between the word and its hypernyms.
The maximised benefit is most evident in
the ?reut-max100? corpus (Figure 7). However,
it needs to be kept in mind that for the last
two data points, Hyper 5 and Hyper All,
the pruning threshold is 200. Therefore, the
comparison with Syns needs to be done with
care. This is not much of a problem, because
the other graphs consistently show that the
performance for Syns is worse than for Hy-
per 5. The difference between Hyper 5 and
Hyper All in ?reut-max100?, can be directly
compared though, because the pruning thresh-
old of 200 is used for both configurations.
Surprisingly, there is a sharp drop in the
overall similarity from Hyper 5 to Hyper All,
much more evident than in the other three
corpora. One possible explanation could be
the different structure of the corpus. It seems
more probable, however, that the high prun-
ing threshold is the cause again. Assuming
that Hyper 5 seldom includes the most gen-
eral concepts, whereas Hyper All always in-
cludes them, their frequency in Hyper All be-
comes so high that the frequencies of all the
other terms are very low in comparison. The
document vectors in case of Hyper All end
up containing mostly meaningless concepts, be-
cause most of the others are pruned. This leads
to decreased cluster quality because the gen-
eral concepts have little discriminating power.
In the corresponding experiments on other cor-
pora, more of the specific concepts are retained.
Therefore, a better balance between general
and specific concepts is maintained, keeping the
cluster quality higher than in the case of corpus
?reut-max100?.
PoS Only performs similar to Baseline, al-
though usually a slight decrease in quality can
be observed. Despite the assumption that the
disambiguation achieved by the PoS tags should
improve clustering results, this is clearly not
the case. PoS tags only disambiguate the cases
where different word classes are represented by
the same stem, e.g., the noun ?run? and the verb
?run?. Clearly the meanings of these pairs are
in most cases related. Therefore, distinguishing
between them reduces the weight of their com-
mon concept by splitting it between two con-
cepts. In the worst case, they are pruned if
treated separately, instead of contributing sig-
nificantly to the document vector as a joint con-
cept.
6 Conclusions
The main finding of this work is that includ-
ing synonyms and hypernyms, disambiguated
only by PoS tags, is not successful in improv-
ing clustering effectiveness. This could be at-
tributed to the noise introduced by all incor-
rect senses that are retrieved from WordNet. It
appears that disambiguation by PoS alone is in-
sufficient to reveal the full potential of including
background knowledge. One obviously imprac-
tical alternative would be manual sense disam-
biguation. The automated approach of only us-
ing the most common sense adopted by Hotho
et al(2003b) seems more realistic yet beneficial.
When comparing the use of different levels of
hypernyms, the results indicate that including
only five levels is better than including all. A
possible explanation of this is that the terms
become too general when all hypernym levels
are included.
Further research is needed to determine
whether this way of document clustering can
be improved by appropriately selecting a sub-
set of the synonyms and hypernyms used
here. There is a number of corpus-based ap-
proaches to word-sense disambiguation (Resnik
and Yarowsky, 2000), which could be used for
this purpose.
The other point of interest that could be fur-
ther analysed is to find out why using five lev-
els of hypernyms produces better results than
using all levels of hypernyms. It would be in-
teresting to see whether this effect persists when
better disambiguation is used to determine ?cor-
rect? word senses.
