Abstract
We present a PCFG parsing algorithm
that uses a multilevel coarse-to-fine
(mlctf) scheme to improve the effi-
ciency of search for the best parse.
Our approach requires the user to spec-
ify a sequence of nested partitions or
equivalence classes of the PCFG non-
terminals. We define a sequence of
PCFGs corresponding to each parti-
tion, where the nonterminals of each
PCFG are clusters of nonterminals of
the original source PCFG. We use the
results of parsing at a coarser level
(i.e., grammar defined in terms of a
coarser partition) to prune the next
finer level. We present experiments
showing that with our algorithm the
work load (as measured by the total
number of constituents processed) is
decreased by a factor of ten with no de-
crease in parsing accuracy compared to
standard CKY parsing with the origi-
nal PCFG. We suggest that the search
space over mlctf algorithms is almost
totally unexplored so that future work
should be able to improve significantly
on these results.
1 Introduction
Reasonably accurate constituent-based parsing
is fairly quick these days, if fairly quick means
about a second per sentence. Unfortunately, this
is still too slow for many applications. In some
cases researchers need large quantities of parsed
data and do not have the hundreds of machines
necessary to parse gigaword corpora in a week
or two. More pressingly, in real-time applica-
tions such as speech recognition, a parser would
be only a part of a much larger system, and
the system builders are not keen on giving the
parser one of the ten seconds available to pro-
cess, say, a thirty-word sentence. Even worse,
some applications require the parsing of multi-
ple candidate strings per sentence (Johnson and
Charniak, 2004) or parsing from a lattice (Hall
and Johnson, 2004), and in these applications
parsing efficiency is even more important.
We present here a multilevel coarse-to-fine
(mlctf) PCFG parsing algorithm that reduces
the complexity of the search involved in find-
ing the best parse. It defines a sequence of in-
creasingly more complex PCFGs, and uses the
parse forest produced by one PCFG to prune
the search of the next more complex PCFG.
We currently use four levels of grammars in our
mlctf algorithm. The simplest PCFG, which we
call the level-0 grammar, contains only one non-
trivial nonterminal and is so simple that min-
imal time is needed to parse a sentence using
it. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that it identi-
fies the locations of correct constituents of the
parse tree (the ?gold constituents?) with high
recall. Our level-1 grammar distinguishes only
argument from modifier phrases (i.e., it has two
nontrivial nonterminals), while our level-2 gram-
mar distinguishes the four major phrasal cate-
gories (verbal, nominal, adjectival and preposi-
tional phrases), and level 3 distinguishes all of
the standard categories of the Penn treebank.
168
The nonterminal categories in these grammars
can be regarded as clusters or equivalence classes
of the original Penn treebank nonterminal cat-
egories. (In fact, we obtain these grammars by
relabeling the node labels in the treebank and
extracting a PCFG from this relabelled treebank
in the standard fashion, but we discuss other ap-
proaches below.) We require that the partition
of the nonterminals defined by the equivalence
classes at level l + 1 be a refinement of the par-
tition defined at level l. This means that each
nonterminal category at level l+1 is mapped to a
unique nonterminal category at level l (although
in general the mapping is many to one, i.e., each
nonterminal category at level l corresponds to
several nonterminal categories at level l + 1).
We use the correspondence between categories
at different levels to prune possible constituents.
A constituent is considered at level l + 1 only
if the corresponding constituent at level l has
a probability exceeding some threshold.. Thus
parsing a sentence proceeds as follows. We first
parse the sentence with the level-0 grammar to
produce a parse forest using the CKY parsing
algorithm. Then for each level l + 1 we reparse
the sentence with the level l + 1 grammar us-
ing the level l parse forest to prune as described
above. As we demonstrate, this leads to consid-
erable efficiency improvements.
The paper proceeds as follows. We next dis-
cuss previous work (Section 2). Section 3 out-
lines the algorithm in more detail. Section
4 presents some experiments showing that the
work load (as measured by the total number of
constituents processed) is decreased by a fac-
tor of ten over standard CKY parsing at the
final level. We also discuss some fine points of
the results therein. Finally in section 5 we sug-
gest that because the search space of mlctf al-
gorithms is, at this point, almost totally unex-
plored, future work should be able to improve
significantly on these results.
2 Previous Research
Coarse-to-fine search is an idea that has ap-
peared several times in the literature of com-
putational linguistics and related areas. The
first appearance of this idea we are aware of is
in Maxwell and Kaplan (1993), where a cover-
ing CFG is automatically extracted from a more
detailed unification grammar and used to iden-
tify the possible locations of constituents in the
more detailed parses of the sentence. Maxwell
and Kaplan use their covering CFG to prune the
search of their unification grammar parser in es-
sentially the same manner as we do here, and
demonstrate significant performance improve-
ments by using their coarse-to-fine approach.
The basic theory of coarse-to-fine approxima-
tions and dynamic programming in a stochastic
framework is laid out in Geman and Kochanek
(2001). This paper describes the multilevel
dynamic programming algorithm needed for
coarse-to-fine analysis (which they apply to de-
coding rather than parsing), and show how
to perform exact coarse-to-fine computation,
rather than the heuristic search we perform here.
A paper closely related to ours is Goodman
(1997). In our terminology, Goodman?s parser
is a two-stage ctf parser. The second stage is a
standard tree-bank parser while the first stage is
a regular-expression approximation of the gram-
mar. Again, the second stage is constrained by
the parses found in the first stage. Neither stage
is smoothed. The parser of Charniak (2000)
is also a two-stage ctf model, where the first
stage is a smoothed Markov grammar (it uses
up to three previous constituents as context),
and the second stage is a lexicalized Markov
grammar with extra annotations about parents
and grandparents. The second stage explores
all of the constituents not pruned out after the
first stage. Related approaches are used in Hall
(2004) and Charniak and Johnson (2005).
A quite different approach to parsing effi-
ciency is taken in Caraballo and Charniak (1998)
(and refined in Charniak et al (1998)). Here
efficiency is gained by using a standard chart-
parsing algorithm and pulling constituents off
the agenda according to (an estimate of) their
probability given the sentence. This probability
is computed by estimating Equation 1:
p(nki,j | s) =
?(nki,j)?(nki,j)
p(s) . (1)
169
It must be estimated because during the
bottom-up chart-parsing algorithm, the true
outside probability cannot be computed. The
results cited in Caraballo and Charniak (1998)
cannot be compared directly to ours, but are
roughly in the same equivalence class. Those
presented in Charniak et al (1998) are superior,
but in Section 5 below we suggest that a com-
bination of the techniques could yield better re-
sults still.
Klein and Manning (2003a) describe efficient
A? for the most likely parse, where pruning is
accomplished by using Equation 1 and a true
upper bound on the outside probability. While
their maximum is a looser estimate of the out-
side probability, it is an admissible heuristic and
together with an A? search is guaranteed to find
the best parse first. One question is if the guar-
antee is worth the extra search required by the
looser estimate of the true outside probability.
Tsuruoka and Tsujii (2004) explore the frame-
work developed in Klein and Manning (2003a),
and seek ways to minimize the time required
by the heap manipulations necessary in this
scheme. They describe an iterative deepening
algorithm that does not require a heap. They
also speed computation by precomputing more
accurate upper bounds on the outside proba-
bilities of various kinds of constituents. They
are able to reduce by half the number of con-
stituents required to find the best parse (com-
pared to CKY).
Most recently, McDonald et al (2005) have
implemented a dependency parser with good
accuracy (it is almost as good at dependency
parsing as Charniak (2000)) and very impres-
sive speed (it is about ten times faster than
Collins (1997) and four times faster than Char-
niak (2000)). It achieves its speed in part be-
cause it uses the Eisner and Satta (1999) algo-
rithm for n3 bilexical parsing, but also because
dependency parsing has a much lower grammar
constant than does standard PCFG parsing ?
after all, there are no phrasal constituents to
consider. The current paper can be thought of
as a way to take the sting out of the grammar
constant for PCFGs by parsing first with very
few phrasal constituents and adding them only

3 Multilevel Course-to-fine Parsing
We use as the underlying parsing algorithm a
reasonably standard CKY parser, modified to
allow unary branching rules.
The complete nonterminal clustering is given
in Figure 1. We do not cluster preterminals.
These remain fixed at all levels to the standard
Penn-tree-bank set Marcus et al (1993).
Level-0 makes two distinctions, the root node
and everybody else. At level 1 we make one
further distinction, between phrases that tend
to be heads of constituents (NPs, VPs, and Ss)
and those that tend to be modifiers (ADJPs,
PPs, etc.). Level-2 has a total of five categories:
root, things that are typically headed by nouns,
those headed by verbs, things headed by prepo-
sitions, and things headed by classical modifiers
(adjectives, adverbs, etc.). Finally, level 3 is the

Figure 2: A tree represented at levels 0 to 3
classical tree-bank set. As an example, Figure 2
shows the parse for the sentence ?He ate at the
mall.? at levels 0 to 3.
During training we create four grammars, one
for each level of granularity. So, for example, at
level 1 the tree-bank rule
S ?NP VP .
would be translated into the rule
HP ?HP HP .
That is, each constituent type found in ?S ?NP
VP .? is mapped into its generalization at level 1.
The probabilities of all rules are computed us-
ing maximum likelihood for constituents at that
level.
The grammar used by the parser can best be
described as being influenced by four compo-
nents:
1. the nonterminals defined at that level of
parsing,
2. the binarization scheme,
3. the generalizations defined over the bina-
rization, and
4. extra annotation to improve parsing accu-
racy.
The first of these has already been covered. We
discuss the other three in turn.
In anticipation of eventually lexicalizing the
grammar we binarize from the head out. For
example, consider the rule
A ?a b c d e
where c is the head constituent. We binarize
this as follows:
A ?A1 e
A1 ?A2 d
A2 ?a A3
A3 ?b c
Grammars induced in this way tend to be
too specific, as the binarization introduce a very
large number of very specialized phrasal cat-
egories (the Ai). Following common practice
Johnson (1998; Klein and Manning (2003b) we
Markovize by replacing these nonterminals with
ones that remember less of the immediate rule
context. In our version we keep track of only the
parent, the head constituent and the constituent
immediately to the right or left, depending on
which side of the constituent we are processing.
With this scheme the above rules now look like
this:
A ?Ad,c e
Ad,c ?Aa,c d
Aa,c ?a Ab,c
Ab,c ?b c
So, for example, the rule ?A ?Ad,c e? would
have a high probability if constituents of type
A, with c as their head, often have d followed
by e at their end.
Lastly, we add parent annotation to phrasal
categories to improve parsing accuracy. If we
assume that in this case we are expanding a rule
for an A used as a child of Q, and a, b, c, d, and
e are all phrasal categories, then the above rules
become:
AQ ?Ad,c eA
Ad,c ?Aa,c dA
Aa,c ?aA Ab,c
Ab,c ?bA cA

Figure 3: Probability of a gold constituent being
pruned as a function of pruning thresholds for
the first 100 sentences of the development corpus
Once we have parsed at a level, we evaluate
the probability of a constituent p(nki,j | s) ac-
cording to the standard inside-outside formula
of Equation 1. In this equation nki,j is a con-
stituent of type k spanning the words i to j, and
?(?) and ?(?) are the outside and inside proba-
bilities of the constituent, respectively. Because
we prune at the end each granularity level, we
can evaluate the equation exactly; no approxi-
mations are needed (as in, e.g., Charniak et al
(1998)).
During parsing, instead of building each con-
stituent allowed by the grammar, we first test
if the probability of the corresponding coarser
constituent (which we have from Equation 1 in
the previous round of parsing) is greater than
a threshold. (The threshold is set empirically
based upon the development data.) If it is below
the threshold, we do not put the constituent in
the chart. For example, before we can use a NP
and a VP to create a S (using the rule above),
we would first need to check that the probability
in the coarser grammar of using the same span
HP and HP to create a HP is above the thresh-
old. We use the standard inside-outside for-
mula to calculate this probability (Equation 1).
The empirical results below justify our conjec-
ture that there are thresholds that allow signifi-
cant pruning while leaving the gold constituents
untouched.

4 Results
In all experiments the system is trained on the
Penn tree-bank sections 2-21. Section 23 is used
for testing and section 24 for development. The
input to the parser are the gold-standard parts
of speech, not the words.
The point of parsing at multiple levels of gran-
ularity is to prune the results of rough levels be-
fore going on to finer levels. In particular, it is
necessary for any pruning scheme to retain the
true (gold-standard WSJ) constituents in the
face of the pruning. To gain an idea of what
is possible, consider Figure 3. According to the
graph, at the zeroth level of parsing and a the
pruning level 10?4 the probability that a gold
constituent is deleted due to pruning is slightly
more than 0.001 (or 0.1%). At level three it is
slightly more that 0.01 (or 1.0%).
The companion figure, Figure 4 shows the
retention rate of the non-gold (incorrect) con-
stituents. Again, at pruning level 10?4 and pars-
ing level 0 we retain about .3 (30%) of the bad
constituents (so we pruned 70%), whereas at
level 3 we retain about .004 (0.4%). Note that
in the current paper we do not actually prune
at level 3, instead return the Viterbi parse. We
include pruning results here in anticipation of
future work in which level 3 would be a precur-
sor to still more fine-grained parsing.
As noted in Section 2, there is some (implicit)

debate in the literature on using estimates of
the outside probability in Equation 1, or instead
computing the exact upper bound. The idea is
that an exact upper bound gives one an admis-
sible search heuristic but at a cost, since it is a
less accurate estimator of the true outside prob-
ability. (Note that even the upper bound does
not, in general, keep all of the gold constituents,
since a non-perfect model will assign some of
them low probability.) As is clear from Figure
3, the estimate works very well indeed.
On the basis of this graph, we set the lowest
allowable constituent probability at ? 5 ? 10?4,
? 10?5, and ? 10?4 for levels 0,1, and 2, re-
spectively. No pruning is done at level 3, since
there is no level 4. After setting the pruning
parameters on the development set we proceed
to parse the test set (WSJ section 23). Figure 5
shows the resulting pruning statistics. The to-
tal number of constituents created at level 0, for
all sentences combined, is 8.82 ? 106. Of those
7.55 ? 106 (or 86.5%) are pruned before going on
to level 1. At level 1, the 1.3 million left over
from level 0 expanded to a total of 9.18 ? 106.
70.8% of these in turn are pruned, and so forth.
The percent pruned at, e.g., level 1 in Figure 3
is much higher than that shown here because it
considers all of the possible level-1 constituents,
not just those left unpruned after level 0.
There is no pruning at level 3. There we sim-
ply return the Viterbi parse. We also show that
with pruning we generate a total of 40.4 ? 106
constituents. For comparison exhaustively pars-
ing using the tree-bank grammar yields a total
of 392 ? 106 constituents. This is the factor-of-10

Figure 6: Running times in seconds on WSJ sec-
tion 23, with and without pruning
workload reduction mentioned in Section 1.
There are two points of interest. The first is
that each level of pruning is worthwhile. We do
not get most of the effect from one or the other
level. The second point is that we get signif-
icant pruning at level 0. The reader may re-
member that level 0 distinguishes only between
the root node and the rest. We initially ex-
pected that it would be too coarse to distinguish
good from bad constituents at this level, but it
proved as useful as the other levels. The expla-
nation is that this level does use the full tree-
bank preterminal tags, and in many cases these
alone are sufficient to make certain constituents
very unlikely. For example, what is the proba-
bility of any constituent of length two or greater
ending in a preposition? The answer is: very
low. Similarly for constituents of length two or
greater ending in modal verbs, and determiners.
Not quite so improbable, but nevertheless less
likely than most, would be constituents ending
in verbs, or ending just short of the end of the
sentence.
Figure 6 shows how much time is spent at each
level of the algorithm, along with a running to-
tal of the time spent to that point. (This is for
all sentences in the test set, length ? 100.) The
number for the unpruned parser is again about
ten times that for the pruned version, but the
number for the standard CKY version is prob-
ably too high. Because our CKY implementa-
tion is quite slow, we ran the unpruned version
on many machines and summed the results. In
all likelihood at least some of these machines
were overloaded, a fact that our local job dis-
tributer would not notice. We suspect that the
real number is significantly lower, though still

Figure 7: Labeled precision/recall f-measure,
WSJ section 23, all sentences of length ? 100
much higher than the pruned version.
Finally Figure 7 shows that our pruning is ac-
complished without loss of accuracy. The results
with pruning include four sentences that did not
receive any parses at all. These sentences re-
ceived zeros for both precision and recall and
presumably lowered the results somewhat. We
allowed ourselves to look at the first of these,
which turned out to contain the phrase:
(NP ... (INTJ (UH oh) (UH yes)) ...)
The training data does not include interjections
consisting of two ?UH?s, and thus a gold parse
cannot be constructed. Note that a different
binarization scheme (e.g. the one used in Klein
and Manning (2003b) would have smoothed over
this problem. In our case the unpruned version
is able to patch together a lot of very unlikely
constituents to produce a parse, but not a very
good one. Thus we attribute the problem not to
pruning, but to binarization.
We also show the results for the most similar
Klein and Manning (2003b) experiment. Our
results are slightly better. We attribute the dif-
ference to the fact that we have the gold tags
and they do not, but their binarization scheme
does not run into the problems that we encoun-
tered.
5 Conclusion and Future Research
We have presented a novel parsing algorithm
based upon the coarse-to-fine processing model.
Several aspects of the method recommend it.
First, unlike methods that depend on best-first
search, the method is ?holistic? in its evalua-
tion of constituents. For example, consider the
impact of parent labeling. It has been repeat-
edly shown to improve parsing accuracy (John-
son, 1998; Charniak, 2000; Klein and Manning,
2003b), but it is difficult if not impossible to
integrate with best-first search in bottom-up
chart-parsing (as in Charniak et al (1998)). The
reason is that when working bottom up it is diffi-
cult to determine if, say, ssbar is any more or less
likely than ss, as the evidence, working bottom
up, is negligible. Since our method computes
the exact outside probability of constituents (al-
beit at a coarser level) all of the top down in-
formation is available to the system. Or again,
another very useful feature in English parsing
is the knowledge that a constituent ends at the
right boundary (minus punctuation) of a string.
This can be included only in an ad-hoc way when
working bottom up, but could be easily added
here.
Many aspects of the current implementation
that are far from optimal. It seems clear to
us that extracting the maximum benefit from
our pruning would involve taking the unpruned
constituents and specifying them in all possible
ways allowed by the next level of granularity.
What we actually did is to propose all possi-
ble constituents at the next level, and immedi-
ately rule out those lacking a corresponding con-
stituent remaining at the previous level. This
was dictated by ease of implementation. Before
using mlctf parsing in a production parser, the
other method should be evaluated to see if our
intuitions of greater efficiency are correct.
It is also possible to combine mlctf parsing
with queue reordering methods. The best-first
search method of Charniak et al (1998) esti-
mates Equation 1. Working bottom up, estimat-
ing the inside probability is easy (we just sum
the probability of all the trees found to build
this constituent). All the cleverness goes into
estimating the outside probability. Quite clearly
the current method could be used to provide a
more accurate estimate of the outside probabil-
ity, namely the outside probability at the coarser
level of granularity.
There is one more future-research topic to add
before we stop, possibly the most interesting of
all. The particular tree of coarser to finer con-
stituents that governs our mlctf algorithm (Fig-
ure 1) was created by hand after about 15 min-
utes of reflection and survives, except for typos,
with only two modifications. There is no rea-
174
son to think it is anywhere close to optimal. It
should be possible to define ?optimal? formally
and search for the best mlctf constituent tree.
This would be a clustering problem, and, for-
tunately, one thing statistical NLP researchers
know how to do is cluster.
