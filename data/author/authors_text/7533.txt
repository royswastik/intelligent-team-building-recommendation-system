Abstract 
 
We address the problem of mining text for 
relevant image metadata.  Our work is situ-
ated in the art and architecture domain, 
where highly specialized technical vocabu-
lary presents challenges for NLP tech-
niques.  To extract high quality metadata, 
the problem of word sense disambiguation 
must be addressed in order to avoid leading 
the searcher to the wrong image as a result 
of ambiguous ? and thus faulty ? meta-
data.  In this paper, we present a disam-
biguation algorithm that attempts to select 
the correct sense of nouns in textual de-
scriptions of art objects, with respect to a 
rich domain-specific thesaurus, the Art and 
Architecture Thesaurus (AAT).  We per-
formed a series of intrinsic evaluations us-
ing a data set of 600 subject terms ex-
tracted from an online National Gallery of 
Art (NGA) collection of images and text.  
Our results showed that the use of external 
knowledge sources shows an improvement 
over a baseline. 
      
1. Introduction 
We describe an algorithm that takes noun phrases 
and assigns a sense to the head noun or phrase, 
given a large domain-specific thesaurus, the Art 
and Architecture Thesaurus1 (published by the 
Getty Research Institute).  This research is part of 
the Computational Linguistics for Metadata

Building (CLiMB) project (Klavans 2006, Kla-
vans in preparation), which aims to improve im-
age access by automatically extracting metadata 
from text associated with images.  We present 
here a component of an overall architecture that 
automatically mines scholarly text for metadata 
terms.  In order to filter and associate a term with 
a related concept, ambiguous terms must be clari-
fied.  The disambiguation of terms is a basic chal-
lenge in computational linguistics (Ide and Vero-
nis 1990, Agirre and Edmonds 2006). 
As more non-specialists in digital libraries 
search for images, the need for subject term ac-
cess has increased.  Subject terms enrich catalog 
records with valuable broad-reaching metadata 
and help improve image access (Layne 1994).  
Image seekers will receive more relevant results 
if image records contain terms that reflect con-
ceptual, semantic, and ontological relationships.  
Furthermore, subject terms associated with hier-
archical and faceted thesaural senses promise to 
further improve precision in image access.  Such 
terms map to standardized thesaurus records that 
include the term?s preferred, variant, and related 
names, including both broader and specific con-
cepts, and other related concepts.  This informa-
tion can then be filtered, linked, and subsequently 
tested for usefulness in performing richer image 
access.  As with other research on disambigua-
tion, our hypothesis is that accurate assignment of 
senses to metadata index terms will results in 
higher precision for searchers.  This hypothesis 
will be fully tested as we incorporate the disam-
biguation module in our end-to-end CLiMB 
Toolkit, and as we perform user studies. 
Finding subject terms and mapping them to a 
thesaurus is a time-intensive task for catalogers 
25
(Rasmussen 1997, Ferguson and Intner 1998).  
Doing so typically involves reading image-related 
text or other sources to find subject terms.  Even 
so, the lack of standard vocabulary in extensive 
subject indexing means that the enriched number 
of subject terms could be inadvertently offset by 
the vocabulary naming problem (Baca 2002).   
This paper reports on our results using the 
subject terms in the AAT; the CLiMB project is 
also using the Thesaurus of Geographic Names 
(TGN) and the Union List of Artist Names 
(ULAN).  Since the focus of this paper is on dis-
ambiguation of common nouns rather than proper 
nouns, the AAT is our primary resource. 
2. Resources 
2.1 Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT)  
The AAT is a widely-used multi-faceted thesau-
rus of terms for the cataloging and indexing of 
art, architecture, artifactual, and archival materi-
als. Since the AAT offers a controlled vocabulary 
for recording and retrieval of data in object, bib-
liographic, and visual databases, it is of interest to 
a wide community. 
In the AAT, each concept is described 
through a record which has a unique ID, preferred 
name, record description, variant names, broader, 
narrower, and related terms.  In total, AAT has 
31,000 such records.  For the purpose of this arti-
cle, a record can be viewed as synonymous with 
sense. Within the AAT, there are 1,400 homo-
nyms, i.e., records with same preferred name.  
For example, the term wings has five senses in 
the AAT (see Figure 1 below).   
Wings (5 senses): 
? Sense#1: Used for accessories that project outward 
from the shoulder of a garment and are made of cloth 
or metal.   
? Sense#2: Lateral parts or appendages of a work of 
art, such as those found on a triptych.  
? Sense#3: The areas offstage and to the side of the 
acting area. 
? Sense#4: The two forward extensions to the sides of 
the back on an easy chair.  
? Sense#5: Subsidiary parts of buildings extending out 
from the main portion. 
Figure 1:  Selection of AAT records for term ?wings? 
Table 1 shows the breakdown of the AAT vo-
cabulary by number of senses with a sample lexi-
cal item for each frequency.

Table 1:  Scope of the disambiguation problem in AAT 
Note that there are potentially three tasks that 
could be addressed with our algorithm: (i) map-
ping a term to the correct sense in the AAT, (ii) 
selecting amongst closely related terms in the 
AAT, and (iii) mapping synonyms onto a single 
AAT entry.  In this paper, our primary focus is on 
task (i); we handle task (ii) with a simple ranking 
approach; we do not address task (iii).  
Table 1 shows that multiple senses per term 
makes mapping subject terms to AAT very chal-
lenging.  Manual disambiguation would be slow, 
tedious, and unrealistic.  Thus we explore auto-
matic methods since, in order to identify the cor-
rect sense of a term in running text, each of these 
senses needs to be viewed in context. 
2.2 The Test Collection 
The data set of terms that we use for evaluation 
comes from the National Gallery of Art (NGA) 
online archive2.  This collection covers paintings, 
sculpture, decorative arts, and works from the 
Middle Ages to the present.  We randomly se-
lected 20 images with corresponding text from 
this collection and extracted noun phrases to form 
the data set.  The data set was divided into two 
categories: the training set and the test set.  The 
training set consisted of 326 terms and was used 
                                                                 
2 http://www.nga.gov/home.htm 
26
to develop the algorithm.  The test set consisted 
of 275 terms and was used to evaluate. 
Following standard procedure in word sense 
disambiguation tasks (Palmer et al 2006), 
groundtruth for the data set was created manually 
by two labelers (referred to as Labeler 1 and La-
beler 2 in Section 4 below).  These labelers were 
part of the larger CLiMB project but they were 
not involved in the development of the disam-
biguation algorithm.  The process of creating the 
groundtruth involved picking the correct AAT 
record for each of the terms in the data set.  
Terms not appearing in the AAT (as determined 
by the labelers) were given an AAT record value 
of zero.  Each labeler worked independently on 
this task and had access to the online version of 
the AAT and the text where each term appeared. 
Interannotator agreement for the task was encour-
agingly high, at 85% providing a notional upper 
bound for automatic system performance (Gale et 
al.  1992).  
Not all terms in this dataset required disam-
biguation; 128 terms (out of 326) under the train-
ing set and 96 terms (out of 275) under the test 
set required disambiguation, since they matched 
more than one AAT record.  The dataset we se-
lected was adequate to test our different ap-
proaches and to refine our techniques.  We intend 
to run over more data as we collect and annotate 
more resources for evaluation. 
2.3 SenseRelate AllWords3 and WordNet4 
SenseRelate AllWords (Banerjee and Pederson 
2003, Patwardhan et al 2003) is a Perl program 
that our algorithm employs to perform basic dis-
ambiguation of words. We have adapted Sen-
seRelate for the purpose of disambiguating AAT 
senses.  
Given a sentence, SenseRelate AllWords dis-
ambiguates all the words in that sentence.  It uses 
word sense definitions from WordNet (in this 
case WordNet 2.1), a large lexical database of 
English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.  As 
an example, consider the text below: 
                                                                 
3 http://sourceforge.net/projects/senserelate 
4 http://wordnet.princeton.edu/ 
With more than fifty individual scenes, the al-
tarpiece was about fourteen feet wide. 
 
The SenseRelate result is: 
With more#a#2 than fifty#n#1 individual#n#1 
scene#n#10 the altarpiece#n#1 be#v#1 about#r#1 
fourteen#n#1 foot#n#2 wide#a#1 
 
In the above example, more#a#2 means SenseRe-
late labeled more as an adjective and mapped it to 
second meaning of more (found in WordNet). 
fifty#n#1 means SenseRelate labeled fifty as a 
noun and mapped it to first meaning of fifty 
(found in WordNet).  Note, that fifty#n#1 maps to 
a sense in WordNet, whereas in our algorithm it 
needs to map to an AAT sense.  In Section 3, we 
show how we translate a WordNet sense to an 
AAT sense for use in our algorithm. 
To perform disambiguation, SenseRelate re-
quires that certain parameters be set:  (1) the 
number of words around the target word (also 
known as the context window), and  (2) the simi-
larity measure.  We used a value of 20 for the 
context window, which means that SenseRelate 
will use 10 words to the left and 10 words to the 
right of the target word to determine the correct 
sense.  We used lesk as the similarity measure in 
our algorithm which is based on Lesk (1986).  
This decision was based on several experiments 
we did with various context window sizes and 
various similarity measures on a data set of 60 
terms.   
27
3. Methodology 
3.1 Disambiguation Algorithm  
 
Figure 2:  Disambiguation Algorithm 
Figure 2 above shows that first we identify the 
noun phrases from the input document.  Then we 
disambiguate each noun phrase independently by 
first looking it up in the AAT.  If a record is 
found, we move on to the next step; otherwise we 
look up the head noun (as the noun phrase) in the 
AAT.  
Second, we filter out any AAT records where 
the noun phrase (or the head noun) is used as an 
adjective (for a term like painting this would be 
painting techniques, painting knives, painting 
equipment, etc). Third, if zero records are found 
in the AAT, we label the term as ?not found in 
AAT.?  If only one matching record is found, we 
label the term with the ID of this record.  Fourth, 
if more than one record is found, we use the dis-
ambiguation techniques outlined in the next sec-
tion to find the correct record.  
3.2 Techniques for Disambiguation 
For each of the terms, the following techniques 
were applied in the order they are given in this 
section. If a technique failed to disambiguate a 
term, we applied the next technique. If none of 
these techniques was able to disambiguate, we 
selected the first AAT record as the correct re-
cord.  Findings for each technique are provided in 
the Results section below. 
First, we used all modifiers that are in the 
noun phrase to find the correct AAT record.  We 
searched for the modifiers in the record descrip-
tion, variant names, and the parent hierarchy 
names of all the matching AAT senses.  If this 
technique narrowed down the option set to one 
record, then we found our correct record.  For 
example, consider the term ceiling coffers.  For 
this term we found two records: coffers (coffered 
ceiling components) and coffers (chests).  The 
first record has the modifier ceiling in its record 
description, so we were able to determine that 
this was the correct record. 
Second, we used SenseRelate AllWords and 
WordNet.  This gave us the WordNet sense of our 
noun phrase (or its head noun).  Using that sense 
definition from WordNet, we next examined 
which of the AAT senses best matches with the 
WordNet sense definition.  For this, we used the 
word overlapping technique where we awarded a 
score of N to an AAT record where N words 
overlap with the sense that SenseRelate picked.  
The AAT record with the highest score was se-
lected as the correct record.  If none of the AAT 
records received any positive score (above a cer-
tain threshold), then it was decided that this tech-
nique could not find the one correct match.  
As an example, consider finding the correct 
sense for the single word noun bells using Sen-
seRelate: 
1. Given the input sentence: 
?? city officials, and citizens were followed by 
women and children ringing bells for joy.? 
2. Search for AAT records.  There are two records 
for the bells in AAT: 
a. bells: ?Flared or bulbous terminals found on 
many open-ended aerophone tubes?. 
b. bells: ?Percussion vessels consisting of a hollow 
object, usually of metal but in some cultures of 
hard clay, wood, or glass, which when struck emits 
a sound by the vibration of most of its mass;?? 
3. Submit the input sentence to SenseRelate, which 
provides a best guess for the corresponding 
WordNet senses for each word. 
4. Get SenseRelate output, which indicates that the 
WordNet definition for bells is WordNet-Sense1, 
i.e., ?a hollow device made of metal that makes a 
ringing sound when struck? 
28
SenseRelate output: 
city#n#1 official#n#1 and citizen#n#1 be#v#1 
follow#v#20 by#r#1 woman#n#1 and child#n#1 
ringing#a#1 bell#n#1 for joy#n#1 
5. Find the correct AAT match using word overlap of 
the WordNet definition and the two AAT defini-
tions for bells: 
 
WordNet:  ?a hollow device made of metal that 
makes a ringing sound when struck? 
compared with: 
AAT: ?Flared or bulbous terminals found on many 
open-ended aerophone tubes? 
and compared with: 
AAT:  ?Percussion vessels consisting of a hollow 
object, usually of metal but in some cultures of 
hard clay, wood, or glass, which when struck 
emits a sound by the vibration of most of its 
mass;?? 
  
6. The second AAT sense is the correct sense accord-
ing to the word overlap (see Table 2 below): 
 
Comparison Score Word Overlap 
AAT ? Definition 1 and 
WordNet Sense1 
0 None 
AAT ? Definition 2 and 
WordNet Sense1 
4 hollow, metal, 
sound, struck 
Table 2: Word Overlap to Select AAT Definition 
Notice that we only used the AAT record descrip-
tion for performing the word overlap.  We ex-
perimented by including other information pre-
sent in the AAT record (like variant names, par-
ent AAT record names) also, but simply using the 
record description yielded the best results.   
Third, we used AAT record names (preferred 
and variant) to find the one correct match.  If one 
of the record names matched better than the other 
record names to the noun phrase name, that re-
cord was deemed to be the correct record.  For 
example, the term altar more appropriately 
matches altars (religious building fixtures) than 
altarpieces (religious visual works).  Another 
example is children, which better matches chil-
dren (youth) than offspring (people by family re-
lationship).   
Fourth, if none of the above techniques 
succeeded in selecting one record, we used the 
most common sense definition for a term (taken 
from WordNet) in conjunction with the AAT re-
sults and word overlapping mentioned above to 
find the one correct record.  
4. Results and Evaluation 
4.1 Methodologies 
We used three different evaluation methods to 
assess the performance of our algorithm.  The 
first evaluation method computes whether our 
algorithm picked the correct AAT record (i.e., the 
AAT sense picked is in agreement with the 
groundtruth).  The second method computes 
whether the correct record is among the top three 
records picked by our algorithm.  In Table 3 be-
low, this is referred to as Top3.  The third evalua-
tion method computes whether the correct record 
is in top five records picked by our algorithm, 
Top5.  The last two evaluations helped us deter-
mine the usability of our algorithm in situations 
where it does not pick the correct record but it 
still narrows down to top three or top five results.  
We ranked the AAT records according to 
their preferred name for the baseline, given the 
absence of any other disambiguation algorithm. 
Thus, AAT records that exactly matched the term 
in question appear on top, followed by records 
that partially matched the term.  For example, for 
term feet, the top three records were feet (terminal 
elements of objects), French feet (bracket feet), 
and Spanish feet (furniture components).  For the 
noun wings, the top three records were wings 
(shoulder accessories), wings (visual works com-
ponents), and wings (backstage spaces). 
4.2 Overall Results 
In this section, we present evaluation results for 
all the terms.  In the next section, we present re-
sults for only those terms that required disam-
biguation. 
Overall results for the training set (326 terms) 
are shown in Table 3. This table shows that over-
all accuracy of our algorithm is 76% and 68% for 
Labeler 1 and Labeler 2, respectively.  The base-
line accuracy is 69% for Labeler 1 and 62% for 
Labeler 2. The other two evaluations show much 
better results.  The Top 3 and Top5 evaluations 
have accuracy of 84% and 88% for Labeler 1 and 
accuracy of 78% and 79% for Labeler 2. This 
argues for bringing in additional techniques to 
29
enhance the SenseRelate approach in order to 
select from Top3 or Top5.

Table 7 shows that SenseRelate is used for most 
of the AAT mappings, and provides a breakdown 
based upon the disambiguation technique used.   
Row One in Table 7 shows how few terms were 
disambiguated using the lookup modifier tech-
nique, just 1 in the training set and 3 in the test 
set.

Rows Two and Three show that most of the terms

rithm for the training set terms:

Table 8: Breakdown of the errors in our algorithm  
under training set (58 total errors) 
Table 8 shows the following: 
(1) Out of the total of 58 errors, 16 errors were 
caused because SenseRelate picked the wrong 
WordNet sense.  
(2) 8 errors were caused because WordNet did 
not  contain the sense of the word in which it was 
30
being used.  For example, consider the term work-
shop.  WordNet has two definitions of workshop: 
i. ?small workplace where handcrafts or manufac-
turing are done? and 
ii. ?a brief intensive course for a small group; em-
phasizes problem solving? 
but AAT has an additional definition that was 
referred by term workshop in the NGA text: 
?In the context of visual and decorative arts, refers 
to groups of artists or craftsmen collaborating to 
produce works, usually under a master's name? 
(3) 11 errors occurred because the AAT record 
definition and the WordNet sense definition did 
not overlap.  Consider the term figures in the sen-
tence, ?As with The Holy Family, the style of the 
figures offers no clear distinguishing characteris-
tic.?  Then examine the AAT and WordNet sense 
definitions below for figures: 
AAT sense: ?Representations of humans or ani-
mals? 
WordNet sense: ?a model of a bodily form (espe-
cially of a person)? 
These definitions do not have any words in com-
mon, but they discuss the same concept. 
(4) 10 errors occurred in the Best Record Match 
technique, 0 errors occurred under the Lookup 
Modifier Technique, and 3 errors occurred under 
the Most Common Sense technique. 
5. Conclusion  
We have shown that it is possible to create an 
automated program to perform word sense dis-
ambiguation in a field with specialized vocabu-
lary.   Such an application could have great poten-
tial in rapid development of metadata for digital 
collections.   Still, much work must be done in 
order to integrate our disambiguation program 
into the CLiMB Toolkit, including the following: 
(1) Our algorithm?s disambiguation accuracy is 
between 48-55% (Table 5 and Table 6), and so 
there is room for improvement in the algorithm.  
Currently we depend on an external program 
(SenseRelate) to perform much of the disam-
biguation (Table 7).  Furthermore, SenseRelate 
maps terms to WordNet and we then map the 
WordNet sense to an AAT sense.  This extra step 
is overhead, and it causes errors in our algorithm.  
We can either explore the option of re-
implementing concepts behind SenseRelate to 
directly map terms to the AAT, or we may need 
to find additional approaches to employ hybrid 
techniques (including machine learning) for dis-
ambiguation.  At the same time, we may benefit 
from the fact that WordNet, as a general resource, 
is domain independent and thus offers wider cov-
erage.  We will need to explore the trade-off in 
precision between different configurations using 
these different resources. 
(2) We need more and better groundtruth.  Our 
current data set of noun phrases includes term 
like favor, kind, and certain aspects.  These terms 
are unlikely to be used as meaningful subject 
terms by a cataloger and will never be mapped to 
AAT.  Thus, we need to develop reliable heuris-
tics to determine which noun phrases are poten-
tially high value subject index terms.  A simple 
frequency count does not achieve this purpose.  
Currently we are evaluating based on ground-
truth that our project members created.  Instead, 
we would like to extend the study to a wider set 
of image catalogers as labelers, since they will be 
the primary users of the CLiMB tool.  Image 
catalogers have experience in finding subject 
terms and mapping subject terms to the AAT.  
They can also help determine which terms are 
high quality subject terms.   
In contrast to working with the highly experi-
enced image cataloger, we also want to extend the 
study to include various groups with different 
user needs.  For example, journalists have ongo-
ing needs for images, and they tend to search by 
subject.  Using participants like these for markup 
and evaluation promises to provide comparative 
results, ones which will enable us to effectively 
reach a broad audience. 
We also would like to test our algorithm on 
more collections.  This will help us ascertain 
what kind of improvements or additions would 
make CLiMB a more general tool.
