Abstract
There are several approaches that
model information extraction as a to-
ken classification task, using various
tagging strategies to combine multiple
tokens. We describe the tagging strate-
gies that can be found in the litera-
ture and evaluate their relative perfor-
mances. We also introduce a new strat-
egy, called Begin/After tagging or BIA,
and show that it is competitive to the
best other strategies.
1 Introduction
The purpose of information extraction (IE) is to
find desired pieces of information in natural lan-
guage texts and store them in a form that is
suitable for automatic querying and processing.
IE requires a predefined output representation
(target structure) and only searches for facts
that fit this representation. Simple target struc-
tures define just a number of slots to be filled
with a string extracted from a text (slot filler).
For this simple kind of information extraction,
statistical approaches that model IE as a token
classification task have proved very successful.
These systems split a text into a series of to-
kens and invoke a trainable classifier to decide
for each token whether or not it is part of a slot
filler of a certain type. To re-assemble the clas-
sified tokens into multi-token slot fillers, various
tagging strategies can be used.
So far, each classification-based IE approach
combines a specific tagging strategy with a spe-
cific classification algorithm and specific other
parameter settings, making it hard to detect
how each of these choices influences the results.
To allow systematic research into these choices,
we have designed a generalized IE system that
allows utilizing any tagging strategy with any
classification algorithm. This makes it possible
to compare strategies or algorithms in an iden-
tical setting. In this paper, we describe the tag-
ging strategies that can be found in the liter-
ature and evaluate them in the context of our
framework. We also introduce a new strategy,
called Begin/After tagging or BIA, and show
that it is competitive to the best other strate-
gies. While there are various approaches that
employ a classification algorithm with one of the
tagging strategies described below, there are no
other comparative analyses of tagging strategies
yet, to the best of our knowledge.
In the next section, we describe how IE can
be modeled as a token classification task and ex-
plain the tagging strategies that can be used for
this purpose. In Sec. 3 we describe the IE frame-
work and the experimental setup used for com-
paring the various tagging strategies. In Sec. 4
we list and analyze the results of the compari-
son.

classification algorithms. These systems split a
text into a series of tokens and invoke a trainable
classifier to decide for each token whether or not
it is part of a slot filler of a certain type. To re-
assemble the classified tokens into multi-token
slot fillers, various tagging strategies can be used.
The trivial (Triv) strategy would be to use
a single class for each slot type and an addi-
tional ?O? class for all other tokens. However,
this causes problems if two entities of the same
type immediately follow each other, e.g. if the
names of two speakers are separated by a line-
break only. In such a case, both names would
be collapsed into a single entity, since the trivial
strategy lacks a way to mark the begin of the
second entity.
For this reason (as well as for improved classi-
fication accuracy), various more complex strate-
gies are employed that use distinct classes to
mark the first and/or last token of a slot filler.
The two variations of IOB tagging are proba-
bly most common: the variant usually called
IOB2 classifies each token as the begin of a slot
filler of a certain type (B-type), as a continua-
tion of the previously started slot filler, if any
(I-type), or as not belonging to any slot filler
(O). The IOB1 strategy differs from IOB2 in us-
ing B-type only if necessary to avoid ambiguity
(i.e. if two same-type entities immediately follow
each other); otherwise I-type is used even at the
beginning of slot fillers. While the Triv strat-
egy uses only n+1 classes for n slot types, IOB
tagging requires 2n+ 1 classes.
BIE tagging differs from IOB in using an ad-
ditional class for the last token of each slot filler.
One class is used for the first token of a slot filler
(B-type), one for inner tokens (I-type) and an-
other one for the last token (E-type). A fourth
class BE-type is used to mark slot fillers consist-
ing of a single token (which is thus both begin
and end). BIE requires 4n+ 1 classes.
A disadvantage of the BIE strategy is the
high number of classes it uses (twice as many
as IOB1|2 ). This can be addressed by introduc-
ing a new strategy, BIA (or Begin/After tag-
ging). Instead of using a separate class for the
last token of a slot filler, BIA marks the first to-
ken after a slot filler as A-type (unless it is the
begin of a new slot filler). Begin (B-type) and
continuation (I-type) of slot fillers are marked in
the same way as by IOB2. BIA requires 3n+ 1
classes, n less than BIE since no special treat-
ment of single-token slot fillers is necessary.
The strategies discussed so far require only a
single classification decision for each token. An-
other option is to use two separate classifiers,
one for finding the begin and another one for
finding the end of slot fillers. Begin/End (BE )
tagging requires n + 1 classes for each of the
two classifiers (B-type + O for the first, E-type
+ O for the second). In this case, there is no
distinction between inner and outer (other) to-
kens. Complete slot fillers are found by com-
bining the most suitable begin/end pairs of the
same type, e.g. by taking the length distribution
of slots into account. Table 1 lists the properties
of all strategies side by side.
3 Classification Algorithm and
Experimental Setup
Our generalized IE system allows employing any
classification algorithm with any tagging strat-
egy and any context representation, provided
that a suitable implementation or adapter ex-
ists. For this paper, we have used the Winnow
(Littlestone, 1988) classification algorithm and

the context representation described in (Siefkes,
2005), varying only the tagging strategy. An ad-
vantage of Winnow is its supporting incremen-
tal training as well as batch training. For
many ?real-life? applications, automatic extrac-
tions will be checked and corrected by a human
revisor, as automatically extracted data will al-
ways contain errors and gaps that can be de-
tected by human judgment only. This correction
process continually provides additional training
data, but the usual batch-trainable algorithms
are not very suited to integrate new data, since
full retraining takes a long time.
We have compared the described tagging
strategies on two corpora that are used very of-
ten to evaluate IE systems, CMU Seminar An-
nouncements and Corporate Acquisitions.1 For
both corpora, we used the standard setup: 50/50
training/evaluation split, averaging results over
five (Seminar) or ten (Acquisitions) random
splits, ?one answer per slot? (cf. Lavelli et al
(2004)). Extraction results are evaluated in the
usual way by calculating precision P and re-
call R of the extracted slot fillers and combin-
ing them in the F-measure, the harmonic mean
of precision and recall: F = 2?P?RP+R .

nificance testing, we applied a paired two-tailed

classification accuracy due to the very unbalanced class
distribution among tokens. In the Seminar Announce-
ments corpus, our tokenization schema yields 139,021 to-

4 Comparison Results
Table 2 list the F-measure results (in percent)
reached for both corpora using batch training.
Incremental results have been omitted due to
lack of space?they are generally slightly worse
than batch results, but in many cases the dif-
ference is small. For the Corporate Acquisitions,
the batch results of the best strategies (IOB2
and BIA) are better than any other published
results we are aware of; for the Seminar An-
nouncements, they are only beaten by the ELIE
system (Finn and Kushmerick, 2004).3
Tables 3 and 4 analyze the performance of
each tagging strategy for both training regimes,
kens, only 9820 of which are part of slot fillers. Thus most
strategies could already reach an accuracy of 93% by al-
ways predicting the O class. Also, correctly extracting
slot fillers is the goal of IE?a higher token classification
accuracy won?t be of any use if information extraction
performance suffers.

using the popular IOB2 strategy as a baseline.
The first item in each cell indicates whether
the strategy performs significantly better (?+?)
or worse (???) than IOB2 or whether the per-
formance difference is not significant at the 95%
level (?o?). In brackets, we show the significance
of the comparison and whether the results are
better or worse when significance is ignored.
Considering these results, we see that the
IOB2 and BIA strategies are best. No strategy
is able to significantly beat the IOB2 strategy
on any slot, neither with incremental nor batch
training. The newly introduced BIA strategy
is the only one that is able to compete with
IOB2 on all slots. The IOB1 and Triv strategies
come close, being significantly worse than IOB2
only for one or two slots. The two-classifier BE
strategy is weaker, being significantly outper-
formed on three (incremental) or four (batch)
slots. Worst results are reached by the BIE
strategy, where the difference is significant in
about half of all cases. The good performance of
BIA is interesting, since this strategy is new and
has never been used before (to our knowledge).
The Triv strategy would have supposed to be
weaker, considering how simple this strategy is.
5 Conclusion
Previously, classification-based approaches to IE
have combined a specific tagging strategy with
a specific classification algorithm and specific
other parameter settings, making it hard to de-
tect how each of these choices influences the re-
sults. We have designed a generalized IE sys-
tem that allows exploring each of these choices
in isolation. For this paper, we have tested the
tagging strategies that can be found in the lit-
erature. We have also introduced a new tagging
strategy, BIA (Begin/After tagging).
Our results indicate that the choice of a tag-
ging strategy, while not crucial, should not be
neglected when implementing a statistical IE
system. The IOB2 strategy, which is very
popular, having been used in public challenges
such as those of CoNLL (Tjong Kim Sang and
De Meulder, 2003) and JNLPBA (Kim et al,
2004), has been found to be indeed the best
of all established tagging strategies. It is ri-
valed by the new BIA strategy. In typical sit-
uations, using one of those strategies should be
a good choice?since BIA requires more classes,
it makes sense to prefer IOB2 when in doubt.
Considering that it is not much worse, the
Triv strategy which requires only a single class
per slot type might be useful in situations where
the number of available classes is limited or the
space or time overhead of additional classes is
high. The two-classifier BE strategy is still in-
teresting if used as part of a more refined ap-
proach, as done by the ELIE system (Finn and
Kushmerick, 2004).4 Future work will be to ob-
serve how well these results generalize in the
context of other classifiers and other corpora.
To combine the strengths of different tagging
strategies, ensemble meta-strategies utilizing the
results of multiple strategies could be explored.
