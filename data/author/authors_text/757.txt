Abstract 
  
This paper tests speech recognition using 
prosody dependent allophone models.  The 
log likehoods of various prosodically 
labeled phonemes are calculated using 
Baum-Welsh re-estimation.  These log 
likehoods are then compared to log 
likehoods of non-prosodically labeled 
phonemes.  Based on the comparison of 
these log likehoods, it can be concluded that 
modeling all prosodic information directly 
in the vowel model leads to improvement in 
the model.   Consonants, on the other hand, 
split naturally into three categories, 
strengthened, lengthened and neutral. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Prosody is an important factor in how humans interpret 
speech.  The same word string can have different 
meanings depending on the way it is said.  Many 
linguists have performed extensive studies of prosody 
and of the effects of prosodic factors on spoken 
language.   
 In his dissertation, Cho (2001) investigates 
how phonetic features are conditioned by prosodic 
factors by examining pre-boundary, post-boundary, and 
accented syllables.  Cho reports that boundary induced 
articulatory strengthening occurs in phrase final vowel 
positions and phrase initial consonant positions.  Phrase 
initial vowels are also more susceptible to coarticulation 
than phrase final vowels.  Cho also hypothesizes that 
accented syllables are characterized primarily by 
sonority expansion.  An accented vowel is usually not 
affected by coarticulation with a neighboring vowel.  
Strengthening effects caused by boundaries and accents 
cannot be considered the same and Cho discusses 
several differences between boundary and accent 
strengthening effects. 
 In a study performed by Edwards et al(1991), 
the effect of final lengthening at prosodic boundaries 
was examined by studying articulator movement 
patterns.  It was found that decreasing intragestural 
stiffness slows down the syllable, affecting the tempo of 
the spoken word, causing the syllable to be lengthened.  
The changing of intergestural phrasing also affects the 
syllable duration by decreasing the overlap of a vowel 
gesture with a consonant gesture.  This increases the 
duration of accented syllables comparatively to 
unaccented syllables and causes the accented syllable to 
be strengthened.  
 De Jong (1994) investigated the supraglottal 
correlates of linguistic prominence in English.  De Jong 
suggests that stress involves a localized shift toward 
hyperarticulated speech.  An increase in the duration in 
the closure and in the aspiration of initial voiceless stops 
was observed along with an increase in duration of 
prevoicing in initial voiced stops in stressed syllables.   
 Fougeron and Keating (1997) report that on the 
edges of prosodic phrase boundaries, final vowels and 
initial consonants have less reduced lingual articulation.  
The differences in articulation were manifested in the 
linguopalatal contact of boundary consonants and 
vowels.  The linguopalatal contact of both consonants 
and vowels relates directly to the type and size of phrase 
boundary.  Boundary type and size also appear to effect 
the acoustic duration of post-boundary consonants. 
 Wightman et al(1992) report that there is 
segmental lengthening in the rhyme of a syllable that 
directly precedes a phrase boundary.  Wightman 
examines the effect of duration and pause on boundary 
words and shows that speaking rate effects the 
distribution of phoneme duration.  The lengthening 
effects of pre-boundary syllables can be used to 
distinguish several different types of phrase boundaries. 
 These results show that prosody can cause 
variations not just in pitch, but also in the articulation of 
phonetic contrasts in different phonemes.  These 
variations can be modeled as a part of the phoneme 
definition in an automatic speech recognition (ASR) 
system. However, the question is whether or not 
modeling prosodic factors with phonemes would lead to 
improvements in the quality of the phoneme model and 
thus lead to improvements in both the correctness and 
accuracy in an ASR system.    
 Most modern speech recognizers function by 
breaking words up into mathematical features.  The 
recognizer then determines the most likely occurring set  
                                                               Edmonton, May-June 2003

of phonemes by comparing these extracted features with 
its own phoneme models.  Phonemes are usually 
modeled using hidden Markov Models (HMMs).  Once 
the recognizer has identified a set of the most likely 
occurring phonemes, it then uses a dictionary to match a 
word or group of words to that set.   
 Prosody can be incorporated into the phoneme 
model by allowing two different HMMs to represent a 
single phoneme.  One HMM would need to represent  
the prosody independent version of the phoneme while 
the other would represent the phoneme in some prosodic 
context.  This could allow the recognizer to do things 
such as distinguish between accented and unaccented 
phonemes or distinguish between boundary and non-
boundary phonemes.  Allowing the recognizer to make 
such a distinction may reduce the confusability of 
certain phoneme groups, which in turn could allow for 
increased recognition rates. 
The goal of this research is to not only 
determine if the inclusion of prosody in the phoneme 
model causes improvement in the model, but also to 
determine which prosodic factors to model and the best 
way to model them.  This will be accomplished by first 
splitting phonemes into different prosodically varying 
groups and then by comparing the log probability of the 
occurrence of each phoneme in those different groups.   
Because prosody causes noticeable variations in speech, 
a phoneme model that includes prosodic factors should 
differ from models of the same phoneme that do not.  
This difference will prove to be significant enough to 
show that prosodic factors should be taken into account 
for a more accurate phoneme model.   
 
2. The Database 
 
Boston University?s Radio News Corpus (1995) was 
used for all experiments.  The speakers from this corpus 
that were analyzed were F1A, F2B, and M2B.  The 
usable data from these three speakers consisted of 259  
 
 
phn       :  phrase medial 
phn!      :  phrase medial, accented 
phnB4   :  phrase final, unaccented 
phnB4!  :  phrase final, accented 
B4phn   :  phrase initial, unaccented 
B4phn!  :  phrase initial, accented

wav files containing 18270 words.  All the wav files 
that were used were accompanied by two types of 
prosodic transcription files, .brk and .ton files.   
 The corpus was labeled according to the ToBI 
standard.  Silverman et al(1992) explain the labeling 
system in detail.  It will not be described in this paper.   
The .brk files specify a ToBI  break index (0-4) 
for every spoken word in the associated wav file.   For  
the experiments, the only boundary distinguished was 
the intonational phrase boundary (ToBI index 4).  All 
other boundary types (indices 0-3) were grouped 
together.   There were 3855 intonational phrase 
boundaries in the data set. 
The .ton files label the times in which an 
accented vowel occurs.  The most abundant accent label 
was H* which occurs in a ratio of about 10 H* for every 
single L*.  Other accent types do occur, but most 
include H* in bitonal accent. 
 
3.  Prosodic Annotation 
 
The set of 38 different phonemes, shown in figure 1, 
were used in the experiments.   
 
3.1 Allophone Modeling 
 
Recognition experiments were preformed for four 
different allophone sets:   
 
? Tied 
? Accent 
? Boundary 
? Untied 
 
The Tied set contained no prosodically labeled 
data.   
The Accent set contained monophones that were 
split into two groups, accented and unaccented.  
Phonemes were not distinguished on the basis of phrase 
position.

Figure 3.   The sixteen experimental conditions 
 
 
The Boundary set modeled monophones as phrase 
initial, phrase medial, or phrase final.  Accented 
phonemes were not distinguished from unaccented 
phonemes.   
The Untied set distinguish phonemes by both 
phrasal position and accentuation.  A monophone in this 
group could be labeled as phrase medial, phrase medial  
accented, phrase initial, phrase initial accented, phrase 
final or phrase final accented.   
 
3.2 Allophone Definitions 
 
Figure 2 contains the six different labels used to 
represent the allophones of a single imaginary phoneme 
?phn.? 
  A phrase final phoneme was considered to be 
any phoneme that occurred in the nucleus or coda of the 
final syllable of a word directly preceding an 
intonational phrase boundary.  Phrase initial phonemes, 
on the other hand, were considered to be any phoneme 
in the onset or nucleus of the initial syllable of a word 
that followed an intonational phrase boundary.  Phase 
medial phonemes were considered to be any other 
phoneme.   
 An accented vowel was the lexically stressed 
vowel in a word containing a transcribed pitch accent.  
Because accented consonants are not clearly defined, 
three different labeled sets of accented  consonants were 
developed: 
 
? All Consonants 
? After Vowel 
? Before Vowel 
 
All Consonants considered every consonant in a syllable 
with an accented vowel to also be accented.  After 
Vowel considered as accented only the coda consonants. 
Before Vowel recognized only the onset consonants of 
the accented syllable as being accented.  Accents were 
considered to be limited to a single syllable. 
 Because there were three different groups of 
accented consonants and because there is only one way 
a vowel can be labeled as accented, vowels were  
beyond b iy y aa n d

separated into a fourth group of their own, entitled 
Vowels.  The four groups along with the four different 
allophone models lead to the sixteen experimental 
conditions illustrated in figure 3.   
 
3.3 Dictionaries and Transcription Types  
 
Each experimental condition required its own dictionary 
and transcription.  Just as each phoneme had six distinct 
allophones, each word had six distinct types.  A word 
could be phrase initial, medial or final and accented or  
unaccented.   Each word type had its own definition.  
An example dictionary is shown in figure 4.   
Every experimental condition had both a word 
level transcription and a phone level transcription.  
Figure 5 shows an example of the two different levels of 
transcription files.

Experiments were performed using the Hidden 
Markov Toolkit (HTK), which is distributed by the 
University of Cambridge (2002).  Phonemes were 
modeled using a three-state HMM with no emitting start 
and end states.   Each emitting state consisted of three 
mixture Gaussians and no state skipping was allowed.    
 
4.1 Experimental Procedure 
 
The Radio News Corpus data was divided into 2 sets: a 
training set and a test set.  The test set was 
approximately 10% of the size of the training set.  The 
experimental procedure was completed for sixteen 
experimental conditions.   
The experimental procedure can be divided 
into two steps.  In step one, the training data was used to  
re-estimate the HMM definitions for each phoneme.  
Re-estimation was performed with the HTK tool HRest, 
which uses Baum-Welsh re-estimation described in 
detail in the HTK book available from Cambridge 
University (2002).  HMM parameters were re-estimated  
 
 
until either the log likehood converged or HRest had 
performed 100 iterations of the re-estimation algorithm.  
 In the second step of the experiments, HRest 
was used to perform a single iteration of the re- 
estimation algorithm on the test data using the HMM 
definitions that were updated from the re-estimation of 
the training set.  During re-estimation, the log likehoods 
of each phoneme were output and saved for later 
comparisons.   
 
4.2 Post Processing 
 
Once all the log likehoods had been recorded, the 
Untied allophone sets were used as a basis to determine 
if the considered monophones were better modeled as 
prosody independent or prosody dependent.  To 
determine the best modeling strategy for a particular 
monophone, six different weighted averages (WA?s) 
were calculated from the Untied log likehoods and 
compared to the computed log likehoods of the 
Boundary, Accent and Tied models.   
 
Table 1.  The results of
experiments for the Accented
allophone sets.  The "Merge"
column lists phonemes with
WA ? LL.  The "Separate"
column indicates phonemes
where WA < LL.   Due to the
relatively small size of the
data set, several phonemes
are missing from the table.

1 = Strengthened, 2 = Neutral, 3 = Lengthened 
b. The proposed modeling of Vowels.  Numbers 1-6 
indicate six different distinguishable prosodic types 
 
 
The following three formulas were used to calculate the 
WA?s of the Untied set for comparison with the 
Boundary set computed value: 
 
WAPM = LphnWphn + L phn!Wphn! 
 
WAPI = LB4phnWB4phn + LB4phn!WB4phn! 
 
WAPF = L phnB4WphnB4 + LphnB4!WphnB4! 
 
where PM, PI, and PF stand for phrase medial, initial 
and final, respectively.  Lx represents the computed log 
likehood of the allophone label x in the Untied 
allophone set, and Wx represents the frequency of that x.   
Wx, where x is representative of any of the six  
types of prosodically labeled monophones, is computed 
by the following formula: 
 
Wx = numx / TOTAL 
 
where numx represents the number of examples of the 
token x, and TOTAL is the sum of all the different 
phoneme tokens being taken into account for the 
computation of WA of some set of phonemes. 
 The two formulas used in calculating the WA?s 
for comparison with the Accent allophone set are as 
follows: 
 
WAU = LphnWphn + LB4phnWB4phn + LphnB4WphnB4 
 
WAA = Lphn!Wphn! + LB4phn!WB4phn! + LphnB4!WphnB4! 
 
where WAU and WAA are the weighted averages of log 
likehoods for the accented and unaccented tokens 
respectively. 
 The WA compared to the Tied set was 
computed as follows: 
 
WAT = Lphn!Wphn! + LB4phn!WB4phn! + LphnB4!WphnB4! + 
LphnWphn + LB4phnWB4phn + LphnB4WphnB4   
 
where WAT is the weighted average of all of the 
phonemes in the Untied model.   
The weighted averages were then compared to 
the log likehoods using the following algorithm: 
 
if (WA < LL), then split using prosodic labels 
 
if (WA ? LL), then do not split using prosodic labels 
 
LL is the log likehood computed using HRest. 
 
5.  Results 
 
For each prosodic variable (phrasal position or accent), 
tables were constructed listing the preferred tying of 
phonemes based on the log likehood results.  Table 1, 
for example, lists all phonemes that should be tied on 
the basis of accent and those that should not.  Similar 
tables exist for phrasal position and for the combination 
of both  accent and phrasal position.  Examples of 
certain phonemes are not present due to the relatively 
small size of the data set.  
Experimental results varied greatly between 
consonants and vowels.  For consonants, there appeared 
to be an improvement in the model when phonemes are 
distinguished by phrasal position.  Separation of 
accented and unaccented phrase initial consonants 
yielded no improvement to the model for most 
consonants.  This implies that phrase initial accented 
and phrase initial unaccented phonemes should be 
merged into a single token.  Accented consonants are 
also not benefited by positional information.  Results 
indicate that phrase initial, medial and final accented 
phonemes can be merged together.  Figure 6a illustrates 
a proposed model for the prosodic labeling of 
consonants based on these results.   
 For vowels, a model showed improvement 
when the phoneme was separated into phrase initial, 
medial and final tokens.  Vowel phoneme models also 
showed improvement when separated by accent.  The 
accent on a vowel appears to be important regardless of 
phrasal position.  These results suggest a six-way 
distinction should be used when modeling vowels and 
the proposed model is illustrated in figure 6b.   
 
6.  Conclusion 
 
While the data used for these experiments was sparse 
for certain phonemes, many of the phoneme models 
tested showed improvement when prosody was 
incorporated directly into the HMM definition.  
Analysis of experimental results led to two different 
proposals for the modeling of consonants and vowels.  
Verifying that the proposed models are indeed an 
improvement over standard phoneme modeling will be a 
goal of future work.
