Abstract
We propose a syntax-semantics interface that
realises the mapping between syntax and se-
mantics as a relation and does not make func-
tionality assumptions in either direction. This
interface is stated in terms of Extensible De-
pendency Grammar (XDG), a grammar formal-
ism we newly specify. XDG?s constraint-based
parser supports the concurrent flow of informa-
tion between any two levels of linguistic rep-
resentation, even when only partial analyses are
available. This generalises the concept of under-
specification.
1 Introduction
A key assumption of traditional syntax-semantics
interfaces, starting with (Montague, 1974), is that
the mapping from syntax to semantics is functional,
i. e. that once we know the syntactic structure of a
sentence, we can deterministically compute its se-
mantics.
Unfortunately, this assumption is typically not
justified. Ambiguities such as of quantifier scope
or pronominal reference are genuine semantic am-
biguities; that is, even a syntactically unambigu-
ous sentence can have multiple semantic readings.
Conversely, a common situation in natural language
generation is that one semantic representation can
be verbalised in multiple ways. This means that the
relation between syntax and semantics is not func-
tional at all, but rather a true m-to-n relation.
There is a variety of approaches in the litera-
ture on syntax-semantics interfaces for coping with
this situation, but none of them is completely sat-
isfactory. One way is to recast semantic ambiguity
as syntactic ambiguity by compiling semantic dis-
tinctions into the syntax (Montague, 1974; Steed-
man, 1999; Moortgat, 2002). This restores function-
ality, but comes at the price of an artificial blow-
up of syntactic ambiguity. A second approach is to
assume a non-deterministic mapping from syntax
to semantics as in generative grammar (Chomsky,
1965), but it is not always obvious how to reverse
the relation, e. g. for generation. For LFG, the oper-
ation of functional uncertaintainty allows for a re-
stricted form of relationality (Kaplan and Maxwell
III, 1988). Finally, underspecification (Egg et al,
2001; Gupta and Lamping, 1998; Copestake et al,
2004) introduces a new level of representation,
which can be computed functionally from a syntac-
tic analysis and encapsulates semantic ambiguity in
a way that supports the enumeration of all semantic
readings by need.
In this paper, we introduce a completely rela-
tional syntax-semantics interface, building upon the
underspecification approach. We assume a set of
linguistic dimensions, such as (syntactic) immedi-
ate dominance and predicate-argument structure; a
grammatical analysis is a tuple with one component
for each dimension, and a grammar describes a set
of such tuples. While we make no a priori function-
ality assumptions about the relation of the linguistic
dimensions, functional mappings can be obtained
as a special case. We formalise our syntax-seman-
tics interface using Extensible Dependency Gram-
mar (XDG), a new grammar formalism which gen-
eralises earlier work on Topological Dependency
Grammar (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001).
The relational syntax-semantics interface is sup-
ported by a parser for XDG based on constraint pro-
gramming. The crucial feature of this parser is that
it supports the concurrent flow of possibly partial in-
formation between any two dimensions: once addi-
tional information becomes available on one dimen-
sion, it can be propagated to any other dimension.
Grammaticality conditions and preferences (e. g. se-
lectional restrictions) can be specified on their nat-
ural level of representation, and inferences on each
dimension can help reduce ambiguity on the oth-
ers. This generalises the idea of underspecifica-
tion, which aims to represent and reduce ambiguity
through inferences on a single dimension only.
The structure of this paper is as follows: in Sec-
tion 2, we give the general ideas behind XDG, its
formal definition, and an overview of the constraint-
based parser. In Section 3, we present the relational
syntax-semantics interface, and go through exam-
ples that illustrate its operation. Section 4 shows
how the semantics side of our syntax-semantics in-
terface can be precisely related to mainstream se-
mantics research. We summarise our results and
point to further work in Section 5.
2 Extensible Dependency Grammar
This section presents Extensible Dependency
Grammar (XDG), a description-based formalism
for dependency grammar. XDG generalizes previ-
ous work on Topological Dependency Grammar
(Duchier and Debusmann, 2001), which focussed
on word order phenomena in German.
2.1 XDG in a Nutshell
XDG is a description language over finite labelled
graphs. It is able to talk about two kinds of con-
straints on these structures: The lexicon of an XDG
grammar describes properties local to individual
nodes, such as valency. The grammar?s principles
express constraints global to the graph as a whole,
such as treeness. Well-formed analyses are graphs
that satisfy all constraints.
An XDG grammar allows the characterisation
of linguistic structure along several dimensions of
description. Each dimension contains a separate
graph, but all these graphs share the same set of
nodes. Lexicon entries synchronise dimensions by
specifying the properties of a node on all dimen-
sions at once. Principles can either apply to a single
dimension (one-dimensional), or constrain the rela-
tion of several dimensions (multi-dimensional).
Consider the example in Fig. 1, which shows an
analysis for a sentence of English along two dimen-
sions of description, immediate dominance (ID) and
linear precedence (LP). The principles of the under-
lying grammar require both dimensions to be trees,
and the LP tree to be a ?flattened? version of the ID
tree, in the sense that whenever a node v is a tran-
sitive successor of a node u in the LP tree, it must
also be a transitive successor of u in the ID tree. The
given lexicon specifies the potential incoming and
required outgoing edges for each word on both di-
mensions. The word does, for example, accepts no
incoming edges on either dimension and must there-
fore be at the root of both the ID and the LP tree. It is
required to have outgoing edges to a subject (subj)
and a verb base form (vbse) in the ID tree, needs
fillers for a subject (sf) and a verb complement field
(vcf) in the LP tree, and offers an optional field for
topicalised material (tf). All these constraints are
satisfied by the analysis, which is thus well-formed.
2.2 Formalisation
Formally, an XDG grammar is built up of dimen-
sions, principles, and a lexicon, and characterises a
set of well-formed analyses.
A dimension is a tuple D = (Lab,Fea,Val,Pri) of
a set Lab of edge labels, a set Fea of features, a set
Val of feature values, and a set of one-dimensional

Figure 1: XDG analysis of ?what does John eat?
principles Pri. A lexicon for the dimension D is a
set Lex ? Fea ? Val of total feature assignments (or
lexical entries). A D-structure, representing an anal-
ysis on dimension D, is a triple (V,E,F) of a set V
of nodes, a set E ?V ?V ?Lab of directed labelled
edges, and an assignment F : V ? (Fea ? Val) of
lexical entries to nodes. V and E form a graph. We
write StrD for the set of all possible D-structures.
The principles characterise subsets of StrD that have
further dimension-specific properties, such as being
a tree, satisfying assigned valencies, etc. We assume
that the elements of Pri are finite representations of
such subsets, but do not go into details here; some
examples are shown in Section 3.2.
An XDG grammar ((Labi,Feai,Vali,Prii)ni=1,Pri,
Lex) consists of n dimensions, multi-dimensional
principles Pri, and a lexicon Lex. An XDG analysis
(V,Ei,Fi)ni=1 is an element of Ana = Str1??? ??Strn
where all dimensions share the same set of nodes V .
Multi-dimensional principles work just like one-
dimensional principles, except that they specify
subsets of Ana, i. e. couplings between dimensions
(e. g. the flattening principle between ID and LP in
Section 2.1). The lexicon Lex ? Lex1 ? ?? ? ? Lexn
constrains all dimensions at once. An XDG analysis
is licenced by Lex iff (F1(w), . . . ,Fn(w)) ? Lex for
every node w ?V .
In order to compute analyses for a given input, we
model it as a set of input constraints (Inp), which
again specify a subset of Ana. The parsing prob-
lem for XDG is then to find elements of Ana that
are licenced by Lex and consistent with Inp and
Pri. Note that the term ?parsing problem? is tradi-
tionally used only for inputs that are sequences of
words, but we can easily represent surface realisa-
tion as a ?parsing? problem in which Inp specifies a
semantic dimension; in this case, a ?parser? would
compute analyses that contain syntactic dimensions
from which we can read off a surface sentence.
2.3 Constraint Solver
The parsing problem of XDG has a natural read-
ing as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) (Apt,
2003) on finite sets of integers; well-formed anal-
yses correspond to the solutions of this problem.
The transformation, whose details we omit due to
lack of space, closely follows previous work on ax-
iomatising dependency parsing (Duchier, 2003) and
includes the use of the selection constraint to effi-
ciently handle lexical ambiguity.
We have implemented a constraint solver for
this CSP using the Mozart/Oz programming system
(Smolka, 1995; Mozart Consortium, 2004). This
solver does a search for a satisfying variable assign-
ment. After each case distinction (distribution), it
performs simple inferences that restrict the ranges
of the finite set variables and thus reduce the size
of the search tree (propagation). The successful
leaves of the search tree correspond to XDG anal-
yses, whereas the inner nodes correspond to partial
analyses. In these cases, the current constraints are
too weak to specify a complete analysis, but they
already express that some edges or feature values
must be present, and that others are excluded. Partial
analyses will play an important role in Section 3.3.
Because propagation operates on all dimensions
concurrently, the constraint solver can frequently
infer information about one dimension from infor-
mation on another, if there is a multi-dimensional
principle linking the two dimensions. These infer-
ences take place while the constraint problem is be-
ing solved, and they can often be drawn before the
solver commits to any single solution.
Because XDG allows us to write grammars with
completely free word order, XDG solving is an NP-
complete problem (Koller and Striegnitz, 2002).
This means that the worst-case complexity of the
solver is exponential, but the average-case complex-
ity for the hand-crafted grammars we experimented
with is often better than this result suggests. We
hope there are useful fragments of XDG that would
guarantee polynomial worst-case complexity.
3 A Relational Syntax-Semantics Interface
Now that we have the formal and processing frame-
works in place, we can define a relational syntax-
semantics interface for XDG. We will first show
how we encode semantics within the XDG frame-
work. Then we will present an example grammar
(including some principle definitions), and finally
go through an example that shows how the rela-
tionality of the interface, combined with the con-
currency of the constraint solver, supports the flow
of information between different dimensions.
3.1 Representing Meaning
We represent meaning within XDG on two dimen-
sions: one for predicate-argument structure (PA),

iii. scope trees
Figure 2: Two analyses for the sentence ?every stu-
dent reads a book.?
and one for scope (SC). The function of the PA di-
mension is to abstract over syntactic idiosyncrasies
such as active-passive alternations or dative shifts,
and to make certain semantic dependencies e. g. in
control constructions explicit; it deals with concepts
such as agent and patient, rather than subject and ob-
ject. The purpose of the SC dimension is to reflect
the structure of a logical formula that would repre-
sent the semantics, in terms of scope and restriction.
We will make this connection explicit in Section 4.
In addition, we assume an ID dimension as above.
We do not include an LP dimension only for ease of
presentation; it could be added completely orthogo-
nally to the three dimensions we consider here.
While one ID structure will typically correspond
to one PA structure, each PA structure will typically
be consistent with multiple SC structures, because
of scope ambiguities. For instance, Fig. 2 shows the
unique ID and PA structures for the sentence ?Ev-
ery student reads a book.? These structures (and the
input sentence) are consistent with the two possi-
ble SC-structures shown in (iii). Assuming a David-
sonian event semantics, the two SC trees (together
with the PA-structure) represent the two readings of
the sentence:
? ?e.?x.student(x) ??y.book(y)? read(e,x,y)
? ?e.?y.book(y)??x.student(x) ? read(e,x,y)
3.2 A Grammar for a Fragment of English
The lexicon for an XDG grammar for a small frag-
ment of English using the ID, PA, and SC dimensions
is shown in Fig. 3. Each row in the table specifies a
(unique) lexical entry for each part of speech (deter-
miner, common noun, proper noun, transitive verb
and preposition); there is no lexical ambiguity in
this grammar. Each column specifies a feature. The
meaning of the features will be explained together
inID outID inPA outPA inSC outSC

TV {ag 7? {subj},pat 7? {obj}, instr 7? {prep}} {} {ag 7? {s},pat 7? {s}, instr 7? {a}}
PREP {arg 7? {pcomp}} {} {arg 7? {s}}
Figure 3: The example grammar fragment
with the principles that use them.
The ID dimension uses the edge labels LabID =
{det,subj,obj,prep,pcomp} resp. for determined
common noun,1 subject, object, preposition, and
complement of a preposition. The PA dimension
uses LabPA = {ag,pat,arg,quant,mod, instr}, resp.
for agent, patient, argument of a modifier, common
noun pertaining to a quantifier, modifier, and instru-
ment; and SC uses LabSC = {r,s,a} resp. for restric-
tion and scope of a quantifier, and for an argument.
The grammar also contains three one-dimen-
sional principles (tree, dag, and valency), and
three multi-dimensional principles (linking, co-
dominance, and contra-dominance).
Tree and dag principles. The tree principle re-
stricts ID and SC structures to be trees, and the
dag principle restricts PA structures to be directed
acyclic graphs.
Valency principle. The valency principle, which
we use on all dimensions, states that the incom-
ing and outgoing edges of each node must obey the
specifications of the in and out features. The possi-
ble values for each feature ind and outd are subsets
of Labd ? {!,?,?}. `! specifies a mandatory edge
with label `, `? an optional one, and `? zero or more.
Linking principle. The linking principle for di-
mensions d1,d2 constrains how dependents on d1
may be realised on d2. It assumes a feature linkd1,d2
whose values are functions that map labels from
Labd1 to sets of labels from Labd2 , and is specified
by the following implication:
v
l
?d1 v
? ? ?l? ? linkd1,d2(v)(l) : v
l?
?d2 v
?
Our grammar uses this principle with the link fea-
ture to constrain the realisations of PA-dependents in
the ID dimension. In Fig. 2, the agent (ag) of reads
must be realised as the subject (subj), i. e.
1We assume on all dimensions that determiners are the
heads of common nouns. This makes for a simpler relationship
between the syntactic and semantic dimensions.
reads ag?PA every ? reads
subj
? ID every
Similarly for the patient and the object. There
is no instrument dependent in the example, so this
part of the link feature is not used. An ergative verb
would use a link feature where the subject realises
the patient; Control and raising phenomena can also
be modelled, but we cannot present this here.
Co-dominance principle. The co-dominance
principle for d1,d2 relates edges in d1 to dominance
relations in the same direction in d2. It assumes a
feature codomd1,d2 mapping labels in Labd1 to sets
of labels in Labd2 and is specified as
v
l
?d1 v
? ? ?l? ? codomd1,d2(v)(l) : v
l?
???d2v
?
Our grammar uses the co-dominance principle on
dimension PA and SC to express, e. g., that the
propositional contribution of a noun must end up in
the restriction of its determiner. For example, for the
determiner every of Fig. 2 we have:
every quant? PA student ? every
r
???SCstudent
Contra-dominance principle. The contra-domi-
nance principle is symmetric to the co-dominance
principle, and relates edges in d1 to dominance
edges into the opposite direction in d2. It assumes
a feature contradomd1,d2 mapping labels of Labd1 to
sets of labels from Labd2 and is specified as
v
l
?d1 v
? ?
?l? ? contradomd1,d2(v)(l) : v?
l?
???d2v
Our grammar uses the contra-dominance principle
on dimensions PA and SC to express, e. g., that pred-
icates must end up in the scope of the quantifiers
whose variables they refer to. Thus, for the transi-
tive verb reads of Fig. 2, we have:
reads ag?PA every ? every
s
???SCreads
reads pat?PA a ? a
s
???SCreads

3.3 Syntax-Semantics Interaction
It is important to note at this point that the syntax-
semantics interface we have defined is indeed re-
lational. Each principle declaratively specifies a set
of admissible analyses, i. e. a relation between the
structures for the different dimensions, and the anal-
yses that the complete grammar judges grammatical
are simply those that satisfy all principles. The role
of the lexicon is to provide the feature values which
parameterise the principles defined above.
The constraint solver complements this relation-
ality by supporting the use of the principles to move
information between any two dimensions. If, say,
the left-hand side of the linking principle is found to
be satisfied for dimension d1, a propagator will infer
the right-hand side and add it to dimension d2. Con-
versely, if the solver finds that the right-hand side
must be false for d2, the negation of the left-hand
side is inferred for d1. By letting principles interact
concurrently, we can make some very powerful in-
ferences, as we will demonstrate with the example
sentence ?Mary saw a student with a book,? some
partial analyses for which are shown in Fig. 4.
Column (i) in the figure shows the state after the
constraint solver finishes its initial propagation, at
the root of the search tree. Even at this point, the va-
lency and treeness principles have conspired to es-
tablish an almost complete ID-structure. By the link-
ing principle, the PA-structure has been determined
similarly closely. The SC-structure is still mostly un-
determined, but by the co- and contra-dominance
principles, the solver has already established that
some nodes must dominate others: A dotted edge
with label s in the picture means that the solver
knows there must be a path between these two nodes
which starts with an s-edge. In other words, the
solver has computed a large amount of semantic in-
formation from an incomplete syntactic analysis.
Now imagine some external source tells us that
with is a mod-child of student on PA, i. e. the anal-
ysis in (iii). This information could come e. g. from
a statistical model of selectional preferences, which
will judge this edge much more probable than an
instr-edge from the verb to the preposition (ii).
Adding this edge will trigger additional inferences
through the linking principle, which can now infer
that with is a prep-child of student on ID. In the other
direction, the solver will infer more dominances on
SC. This means that semantic information can be
used to disambiguate syntactic ambiguities, and se-
mantic information such as selectional preferences
can be stated on their natural level of representation,
rather than be forced into the ID dimension directly.
Similarly, the introduction of new edges on SC
could trigger a similar reasoning process which
would infer new PA-edges, and thus indirectly also
new ID-edges. Such new edges on SC could come
from inferences with world or discourse knowledge
(Koller and Niehren, 2000), scope preferences, or
interactions with information structure (Duchier and
Kruijff, 2003).
4 Traditional Semantics
Our syntax-semantics interface represents seman-
tic information as graphs on the PA and SC dimen-
sions. While this looks like a radical departure from
traditional semantic formalisms, we consider these
graphs simply an alternative way of presenting more
traditional representations. We devote the rest of the
paper to demonstrating that a pair of a PA and a SC
structure can be interpreted as a Montague-style for-
mula, and that a partial analysis on these two di-
mensions can be seen as an underspecified semantic
description.
4.1 Montague-style Interpretation
In order to extract a standard type-theoretic expres-
sion from an XDG analysis, we assign each node v
two semantic values: a lexical value L(v) represent-
ing the semantics of v itself, and a phrasal value
P(v) representing the semantics of the entire SC-
subtree rooted at v. We use the SC-structure to de-
termine functor-argument relationships, and the PA-
structure to establish variable binding.
We assume that nodes for determiners and proper
names introduce unique individual variables (?in-
dices?). Below we will write ??v?? to refer to the in-
dex of the node v, and we write ?` to refer to the
node which is the `-child of the current node in the
appropriate dimension (PA or SC). The semantic lex-
icon is defined as follows; ?L(w)? should be read as
?L(v), where v is a node for the word w?.
L(a) = ?P?Q?e.?x(P(x)?Q(x)(e))
L(book) = book?
L(with) = ?P?x.(with?(???arg??)(x)?P(x))
L(reads) = read?(???pat??)(???ag??)
Lexical values for other determiners, common
nouns, and proper names are defined analogously.
Note that we do not formally distinguish event
variables from individual variables. In particular,
L(with) can be applied to either nouns or verbs,
which both have type ?e, t?.
We assume that no node in the SC-tree has more
than one child with the same edge label (which our
grammar guarantees), and write n(`1, . . . , `k) to in-
dicate that the node n has SC-children over the edge
labels `1, . . . , `k. The phrasal value for n is defined
(in the most complex case) as follows:
P(n(r,s)) = L(n)(P(?r))(? ??n??.P(?s))
This rule implements Montague?s rule of quan-
tification (Montague, 1974); note that ? ??n?? is a
binder for the variable ??n??. Nodes that have no
s-children are simply functionally applied to the
phrasal semantics of their children (if any).
By way of example, consider the left-hand SC-
structure in Fig. 2. If we identify each node by the
word it stands for, we get the following phrasal
@
@
every

value for the root of the tree:
L(a)(L(book))(?x.L(every)(L(student)
(?y.read?(y)(x)))),
where we write x for ??a?? and y for ??every??. The
arguments of read? are x and y because every and
a are the arg and pat children of reads on the PA-
structure. After replacing the lexical values by their
definitions and beta-reduction, we obtain the fa-
miliar representation for this semantic reading, as
shown in Section 3.1.
4.2 Underspecification
It is straightforward to extend this extraction of
type-theoretic formulas from fully specified XDG
analyses to an extraction of underspecified seman-
tic descriptions from partial XDG analyses. We will
briefly demonstrate this here for descriptions in the
CLLS framework (Egg et al, 2001), which sup-
ports this most easily. Other underspecification for-
malisms could be used too.
Consider the partial SC-structure in Fig. 5, which
could be derived by the constraint solver for the
sentence from Fig. 2. We can obtain a CLLS con-
straint from it by first assigning to each node of
the SC-structure a lexical value, which is now a part
of the CLLS constraint (indicated by the dotted el-
lipses). Because student and book are known to be r-
daughters of every and a on SC, we plug their CLLS
constraints into the r-holes of their mothers? con-
straints. Because we know that reads must be dom-
inated by the s-children of the determiners, we add
the two (dotted) dominance edges to the constraint.
Finally, variable binding is represented by the bind-
ing constraints drawn as dashed arrows, and can be
derived from PA exactly as above.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we have shown how to build a fully re-
lational syntax-semantics interface based on XDG.
This new grammar formalism offers the grammar
developer the possibility to represent different kinds
of linguistic information on separate dimensions
that can be represented as graphs. Any two dimen-
sions can be linked by multi-dimensional principles,
which mutually constrain the graphs on the two di-
mensions. We have shown that a parser based on
concurrent constraint programming is capable of in-
ferences that restrict ambiguity on one dimension
based on newly available information on another.
Because the interface we have presented makes
no assumption that any dimension is more ?basic?
than another, there is no conceptual difference be-
tween parsing and generation. If the input is the sur-
face sentence, the solver will use this information
to compute the semantic dimensions; if the input is
the semantics, the solver will compute the syntactic
dimensions, and therefore a surface sentence. This
means that we get bidirectional grammars for free.
While the solver is reasonably efficient for many
(hand-crafted) grammars, it is an important goal
for the future to ensure that it can handle large-
scale grammars imported from e.g. XTAG (XTAG
Research Group, 2001) or induced from treebanks.
One way in which we hope to achieve this is to iden-
tify fragments of XDG with provably polynomial
parsing algorithms, and which contain most useful
grammars. Such grammars would probably have to
specify word orders that are not completely free,
and we would have to control the combinatorics
of the different dimensions (Maxwell and Kaplan,
1993). One interesting question is also whether dif-
ferent dimensions can be compiled into a single di-
mension, which might improve efficiency in some
cases, and also sidestep the monostratal vs. multi-
stratal distinction.
The crucial ingredient of XDG that make rela-
tional syntax-semantics processing possible are the
declaratively specified principles. So far, we have
only given some examples for principle specifi-
cations; while they could all be written as Horn
clauses, we have not committed to any particular
representation formalism. The development of such
a representation formalism will of course be ex-
tremely important once we have experimented with
more powerful grammars and have a stable intuition
about what principles are needed.
At that point, it would also be highly interest-
ing to define a (logic) formalism that generalises
both XDG and dominance constraints, a fragment of
CLLS. Such a formalism would make it possible to
take over the interface presented here, but use dom-
inance constraints directly on the semantics dimen-
sions, rather than via the encoding into PA and SC
dimensions. The extraction process of Section 4.2
could then be recast as a principle.
