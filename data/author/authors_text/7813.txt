Abstract 
In this paper, we analyze the performance 
of name finding in the context of a variety 
of automatic speech recognition (ASR) 
systems and in the context of one optical 
character recognition (OCR) system. We 
explore the effects of word error rate from 
ASR and OCR, performance as a function 
of the amount of training data, and for 
speech, the effect of out-of-vocabulary 
errors and the loss of punctuation and mixed 
case 
I Introduction 
Information extraction systems have 
traditionally been evaluated on online text with 
relatively few errors in the input. For example, 
this description of the Nominator system 
(Wacholder et al 1997) would apply to several 
other systems: "We chose The Wall Street 
Journal corpus because it follows standard 
stylistic conventions, especially capitalization, 
which is essential for Nominator to work." The 
real-world challenge, however, is pointed out in 
Palmer and Day (1997): "It is also unknown 
how the existing high-scoring systems would 
perform on less well-behaved texts, such as 
single-case texts, non-newswire texts, or text 
obtained via optical character recognition 
(OCR)." 
In this paper we explore how performance 
degrades on noisy input, in particular on 
broadcast news (speech) and on newspaper 
(printed matter). Error rates of automatic 
speech recognizers (ASR) on broadcast news 
are still very high, e.g., 14-28% word error. 
Though character error can be very low for laser 
printer output, word error rates of 20% are 
possible for OCR systems applied to newsprint 
or low-quality printed matter. 
In this paper, we evaluate a learning algorithm, 
a hidden Markov model (HM) ,  for named 
entity extraction applied to human transcripts of 
news, to transcripts without case or punctuation 
(perfect speech output), to errorful ASR output 
and to OCR output. Extracting information from 
noisy sources poses the following challenges, 
which are addressed in the paper. 
? Since speech recognizers do not generate 
mixed case nor punctuation, how much do 
case and punctuation contribute to 
recognizing names in English? (Section 3.) 
Note that these challenges also arise in 
languages without case to signal proper 
nouns (e.g., Chinese, German, Japanese), in 
mono-case English or informal English 
(e.g., emails). 
? How much will performance degrade with 
increasing error in the input? (Section 4.) 
? How does closed vocabulary recognition 
affect information extraction performance? 
(Section 5) 
? For the learning algorithm employed, how 
much training and effort are required? 
(Section 6) 
? How much do lists of names contribute to 
performance? (Section 7)

2 Algorithms and Data 
2.1 Task Definition and Data 
The named entity (NE) task used for this 
evaluation requires the system to identify all 
named locations, named persons, named 
organizations, dates, times, monetary amounts, 
and percentages. The task definition is given in 
Chinchor, et al (1998). 
For speech recognition, roughly 175 hours of 
news broadcasts (roughly 1.2m words of audio) 
were available from the National Institute for 
Science and Technology (NIST) for training. 
All of that data includes both the audio and a 
manual transcription. The test set consisted of 3 
hours of news (roughly 25k words). 
For the combined OCR/NE system, the OCR 
component was trained on the University of 
Washington English Image Database, which is 
comprised primarily of technical journal 
articles. The NE system was trained separately 
on 690K words of 1993 Wall Street Journal 
(WSJ) data (roughly 1250 articles), including 
development data from the Sixth Message 
Understanding Conference (MUC-6) Named 
Entity evaluation. The test set was 
approximately 20K words of separate WSJ data 
(roughly 45 articles), also taken from the MUC- 
6 data set. Both test and training texts were 
original text (no OCR errors) in mixed case with 
normal punctuation. Printing the on-line text, 
rather than using the original newsprint, 
produced the images for OCR, which were all 
scanned at 600 DPI. 
2.2 Algorithms 
The information extraction system tested is 
IdentiFinder(TM), which has previously been 
detailed in Bikel et al (1997, 1999). In that 
system, an HMM labels each word either with 
one of the desired classes (e.g., person, 
organization, etc.) or with the label NOT-A- 
NAME (to represent "none of the desired 
classes"). The states of the HMM fall into 
regions, one region for each desired class plus 
one for NOT-A-NAME. (See Figure 2-1.) The 
HMM thus has a model of each desired class 
and of the other text. Note that the 
implementation is not confined to the seven 
name classes used in the NE task; the particular 
classes to be recognized can be easily changed 
via a parameter. 
Within each of the regions, we use a statistical 
bigram language model, and emit exactly one 
word upon entering each state. Therefore, the 
number of states in each of the name-class 
regions is equal to the vocabulary size. 
Additionally, there are two special states, the 
START-OF-SENTENCE and END-OF-SENTENCE 
states. In addition to generating the word, states 
may also generate f atures of that word. 
START-OF-SENTENCE END-OF SENTENCE

3 Effect of Textual Clues 
The output of each of the speech recognizers i  
in SNOR (speech normalized orthographic 
representation) format, a format which is largely 
unpunctuated and in all capital letters 
(apostrophes and periods after spoken letters are 
preserved). When a typical NE extraction 
system runs on ordinary English text, it uses 
punctuation and capitalization as features that 
contribute to its decisions. In order to learn how 
much degradation i performance is caused by 
the absence of these features from SNOR 
format, we performed the following experiment. 
We took a corpus that had full punctuation and 
mixed case and preprocessed it to make three 
new versions: one with all upper case letters but 
punctuation preserved, one with original case 
but punctuation marks removed, and one with 
both case and punctuation removed. We then 
partitioned all four versions of the corpus into a 
training set and a held-out est set, using the 
same partition in all four versions, and 
measured I entiFinder's performance. 
The corpus we used for this experiment was the 
transcriptions of the second 100 hours of the 
Broadcast News acoustic modelling data, 
comprising 114 episodes. We partitioned this 
data to form a training set of 98 episodes 
(640,000 words) and a test set of 16 episodes 
(130,000 words). Because the test transcriptions 
were created by humans, they have a 0% word 
error rate. The results are shown in Table 3-1. 
The removal of case information has the greater 
effect, reducing performance by 2.3 points, 
while the loss of punctuation reduces 
performance by 1.4 points. The loss from 
removing both features is 3.4 points, less than 
the sum of the individual degradations. This 
suggests that there are some events where both 
mixed case and punctuation are required to lead 
IdentiFinder to the correct answer.

Case Case 
With punctuation 92.4 90.1 
Without punctuation 91.0 89.0 
Table 3-1: Effect of case and punctuation on 
performance(F-measure) on Broadcast News 
data 
It should be noted that because the data are 
transcriptions of speech, no version of the 
corpus contains all the textual clues that would 
appear in newspaper text like the MUC-7 New 
York Times data. In particular, numbers are 
written out in words as they would be spoken, 
not represented using digits, and abbreviations 
such as "Dr.", "Jr." or "Sept." are expanded out 
to their full spoken word. We conclude that the 
degradation in performance going from 
newspaper text to SNOR recognizer output is at 
least 3.4 points in the 0% WER case, and 
probably more due to these other missing text 
clues. 
4 Effect of Word Errors 
4.1 Optical Character 
(OCR) 
Recognition 
The OCR experiments were performed using the 
system described in Makhoul et al (1998). 
Recognition was performed at the character 
level, rather than the word level, so the 
vocabulary is not closed (unlike the ASR results 
discussed in subsequent sections). Figure 4-1 
shows IdentiFinder's performance under 4 
conditions of varying word error ate (WER): 
1. Original text (no OCR, 0% WER) 
2. OCR from high-quality (laser-printed) text 
images (2.7% WER) 
3. OCR on degraded images (13.7% WER). 
4." OCR on degraded images, processed with a 
weak character language model (19.1% 
WER) 
For the second and third conditions, 1.3M 
characters of Wall Street Journal were used for 
318 
OCR language model training: the fourth 
condition used a much weaker character 
language model, which accounts for the poorer 
performance. 
The interpolated line has been fit to the 
performance of the OCR-based systems, with a 
slope indicating 0.6 points of F-measure lost for 
each percentage point increase in word error. 
The line has been extrapolated to 0% WER: the 
actual 0% WER condition is 95.4, which only 
slightly exceeds the projected value.

Figure 5-1 shows IdentiFinder's performance on

evaluations (Przybocki, et al, 1999). These 
experiments were run in co-operation with 
NIST. The interpolated line has been fit to the 
errorful transcripts, and then extrapolated out to 
0% WER speech. As can be seen, the line fits 
the data extremely well, and has a slope of 0.7 
points of F-measure lost for each additional 1% 
of word error rate. The fact that the extrapolated

performance of the OCR system: for example, when 
testing on degraded ata, it would be usual to include

concern for this experiment, however, which focussed 
on name finding performance.

5 Out of Vocabulary Rates for Names 
It is generally agreed that out-of-vocabulary 
(OOV) words do not have a major impact on the 
word error rate achieved by large vocabulary 
speech recognizers doing transcription. The 
reason is that speech lexicons are designed to 
include the most frequent words, thus ensuring 
that OOV words will represent only a small 
fraction of the words in any test set. However, 
we have seen that the ,OOV rate for words that 
are part of named-entities can be as much as a 
factor of ten greater than the baseline OOV for 
non-name words. This could make OOV a 
major problem for NE extraction from speech. 
To explore this, we measured the percentage of
names in the Broadcast News data that contain 
at least one OOV word as a function of lexicon 
size. For this purpose, we built lexicons simply 
by ordering the words of the 1998 Hub-4 
Language Modeling data according to

frequency, and truncating the list at various 
lengths. The percentage of in-vocabulary events 
of each type as a function of lexicon size is 
shown in Table 5-1. 
Most modem speech recognizers employ a 
vocabulary of roughly 60,000 words; using a 
larger lexicon introduces more errors from 
acoustic perplexity than it fixes through 
enlarged vocabulary. It is clear from the table 
that the only name category that might suffer a 
significant OOV problem with a 60K 
vocabulary is PERSONs. One might imagine 
that a more carefully constructed lexicon could 
reduce the OOV rate for PERSONs while still 
staying within the 60,000 word limit. However, 
even if a cleverly designed 60K lexicon 
succeeded in having the name coverage of the 
frequency-ordered 120K word lexicon (which 
contains roughly 40,000 more proper names 
than the 60K lexicon), it would reduce the 
PERSON OOV rate by only 4% absolute. 
6 Effect of training set size 
6.1 Automatic Speech Recognition 
We have measured NE performance in the 
context of speech as a function of training set 
size and found that the performance increases 
logarithmically with the amount of training data 
for 15% WER test data as well as for 0% WER 
input. However the growth rate is slower for 
15% WER test data. We constructed small 
training sets of various size by randomly 
selecting sets of 6, 12, 25, and 49 episodes from 
the second 100 hours of annotated Broadcast 
News training data. We also defined a training 
set of 98 episodes from the second 100 hours, as 
well as sets containing the full 98 episodes plus 
some or all of the first 100 hours of Broadcast 
News training. Our largest training set contained 
1.2 million words, and our smallest a mere 
30,000 words. All training data were converted 
to SNOR format. 
Given that PERSONs account for roughly 50% 
of the named-entities in broadcast news, the 
maximum gain in F measure available for 
doubling the lexicon size is 2 points. Moreover, 
this gain would require that every PERSON 
name added to the vocabulary be recognized 
properly -- an unlikely prospect, since most of 
these words will not appear in the acoustic 
training for the recognizer. For these reasons, 
we conclude that the OOV problem is not a 
major factor in determining NE performance 
from speech. 
For each training set, we trained a separate 
IdentiFinder model and evaluated it on two 
versions of the 1998 Hub4-IE data -- the 0% 
WER transcription created by a human, and an 
ASR transcript with 15%. The results are 
plotted in Figure 6-1. The slopes of the 
interpolated lines predict that IdentiFinder's 
performance on 15% WER speech will increase 
by 1.5 points for each additional doubling of the 
training data, while performance goes up 1.8 
points per doubling of the training for perfect 
speech input.

Possibly, the difference in slope of the two lines 
is that the real value of increasing the training 
set lies in increasing the number of distinct rare 
names that appear. Once an example is in the 
training, IdentiFinder is able to extract it and use 
it in test. However, when the test data is 
recognizer output, the rare names are less likely 
to appear in the test, either because they don't 
appear in the speech lexicon or they are poorly 
trained in the speech model and misrecognized. 
If they don't appear in the test, IdentiFinder can't 
make full use of the additional training, and thus 
performance on errorful input increases more 
slowly than it does on error-free input text.

7 Effect of Lists 
Like most NE extraction systems, IdentiFinder 
can use lists of strings of known to be names to 
estimate the probability that a word will be a 
name, given that it appears on a particular list. 
We trained two models on 1.2 million words of 
SNOR data, one with lists and one without. We 
tested on the human transcription (0% WER) 
and the ASR (15% WER) versions of the 1998 
evaluation transcripts. Table 7-1 shows the 
results. We see that on human constructed 
transcripts, lists improve the performance by a 
To our knowledge, no other information 
extraction technology has been applied to OCR 
material. 
For audio materials, three related efforts were 
benchmarked on NE extraction from broadcast 
news. Palmer, et al (1999) employs an HMM 
very similar to that reported for IdentifFinder 
(Bikel et al, 1997,1999). Renals et al (1999) 
reports on a rule-based system and an HMM 
integrated with a speech recognizer. Appelt and 
Martin (1999) report on the TEXTPRO system, 
which recognises names using manually written 
finite state sales. 
322 
Of these, the Palmer system and TEXTPRO 
report results on five different word error rates. 
Both degrade linearly, about .7F, with each 1% 
increase in WER from ASR. None report the 
effect of training set size, capitalization, 
punctuation, or out-of-vocabulary items. 
Of the four systems, IdentiFinder epresents 
state-of-the-art performance. Of all the systems 
evaluated, those with the simple architecture of 
ASR followed by information extraction 
performed markedly better than the system 
where extraction was more integrated with 
ASR. 
In general, these results compare favorably with 
results reported in the Message Understanding 
Conference (Chinchor, et al, 1998). The 
highest NE score in MUC-7 was 93.39; for 0% 
WER, our best score was 90.5 without case and 
punctuation which costs about 3.4 points. 
9 Conclusions 
First and foremost, the hidden Markov model is 
quite robust in the face of errorful input. 
Performance on both speech and OCR input 
degrades linearly as a function of word error. 
Even, without case information or punctuation 
in the input, the performance on the broadcast 
news task is above 90%, with only a 3.4 point 
degradation in performance due to missing 
textual clues. Performance even with 15% word 
error degrades by only about 8 points of F for 
both OCR and ASR systems. 
Second, because annotation can be performed 
quickly and inexpensively by non-experts, 
training-based systems like IdentiFinder offer a 
powerful advantage in moving to new languages 
and new domains. In our experience, annotation 
of English typically proceeds at 5k words per 
hour or more. This means interesting 
performance an be achieved with as little as 20 
hours of student annotation (i.e., at least 100k 
words). Increasing training continually 
improves performance, generally as the 
logarithm of the training set size. On 
transcribed speech, performance is already good 
(89.3 on 0% WER) with only 100 hours or 
643K words of training data. 
Third, though errors due to words out of the 
vocabulary of the speech recognizer are a 
problem, they represent only about 15% of the 
errors made by the combined speech recognition 
and named entity system. 
Fourth, we used exactly the same training data, 
modeling, and search algorithm for errorful 
input as we do for error-free input. For OCR, 
we trained on correct newswire once only for 
both correct text input 0% (WER) and for a 
variety of errorful text input conditions. For 
speech, we simply transformed text training data 
into SNOR format and retrained. Using this 
approach, the only cost of handling errorful 
input from OCR or ASR was a small amount of 
computing time. There were no rules to rewrite, 
no lists to change, and no vocabulary 
adjustments. Even so, the degradation in 
performance on errorful input is no worse than 
the word error rate of the OCR/ASR system.
