Abstract
To date, traditional NLP parsers have
not been widely successful in TESOL-
oriented applications, particularly in scor-
ing written compositions. Re-engineering
such applications to provide the neces-
sary robustness for handling ungrammat-
ical English has proven a formidable ob-
stacle. We discuss the use of a non-
traditional parser for rating compositions
that attenuates some of these difficulties.
Its dependency-based shallow parsing ap-
proach provides significant robustness in
the face of language learners? ungrammat-
ical compositions. This paper discusses
how a corpus of L2 essays for English was
rated using the parser, and how the auto-
matic evaulations compared to those ob-
tained by manual methods. The types of
modifications that were made to the sys-
tem are discussed. Limitations to the cur-
rent system are described, future plans for
developing the system are sketched, and
further applications beyond English essay
rating are mentioned.
1 Introduction
Rating constructed response items, particularly es-
says, is a time-consuming effort. This is true in
rating essays written by second-language speakers.
To make this process more manageable, researchers
have investigated how to involve computers in the
grading process. Several factors suggest why au-
tomating scoring might be desirable: (i) practical-
ity: essay grading is costly and time-consuming;
(ii) consistency: essay grading is somewhat subjec-
tive in nature, and consistency may sometimes suf-
fer; and (iii) feedback: Providing feedback to a stu-
dent is important, and automated scoring can pro-
vide ways of generating specific suggestions tailored
to the needs of the author.
However, computerized rating of essays written
by second-language speakers poses unique dilem-
mas, particularly for responses written by exami-
nees at low levels of language proficiency. Where
we expect generally well-formed sentences from na-
tive English speaker responses, we find that the ma-
jority of the responses by lower proficiency second-
language English speakers will be made up of ill-
formed sentences.
Previous work in automated essay grading and
related technologies has been surveyed and dis-
cussed in several different forums (Burstein and
Chodorow, 1999; Thompson, 1999; Hearst, 2000;
Williams, 2001; Rudner and Gagne, 2001), and
a thorough survey of the field has recently been
published (Shermis and Burstein, 2003). Typi-
cally these approaches have borrowed techniques
and tools from several natural language processing
(NLP) fields. For example, the knowledge-based en-
gines have been used for analyzing essays: parsers
(Carbonell and Hayes, 1984; Schneider and McCoy,
1998), grammar and spelling checkers (Park et al,
1997), discourse processing analyzers (Miltsakaki
and Kukich, 2000), and other hand-crafted linguistic
knowledge sources.

On the other hand, much work has leveraged sta-
tistical methods in detecting properties of student es-
says via stylometrics (Aaronson, 2001)1, latent se-
mantic indexing (Wiemer-Hastings et al, 1998), and
feature analysis.
Finally, mirroring noteworthy progress in other
NLP fields involving data-driven methods, recent
work has involved essay grading via exemplar-based
machine learning techniques (Chodorow and Lea-
cock, 2000).
The most visible systems implement one (or
more) of these approaches. The Project Essay
Grade (PEG) system, for example, uses lexically-
based metrics in scoring (Page, 2003). The Intel-
ligent Essay Assessor (IEA) uses latent semantic
analysis in calculating its metrics (Landauer et al,
2003). The E-Rater system by Educational Testing
Services uses syntactic, discourse, and topical (i.e.
vocabulary-based) data analysis (Burstein, 2003).
Several criticisms have been aimed at automatic
scoring systems on both theoretical and implementa-
tional grounds. For example, many systems exhibit
an inherent Achilles? heel since it is possible to trick
them into evaluating a nonsensical text purely by
reverse-engineering the scoring mechanism and de-
signing a text that responds to the criteria. Another
problem is the cost of development, which can be
substantial. In addition, most systems are designed
around certain specific topics in order to focus ter-
minology and vocabulary in limited subdomains; in-
troducing new subject areas requires building a new
model, often a nontrivial process. Thus, many sys-
tems are often not adaptable enough to meet the par-
ticular needs of an individual, class, teacher, or in-
stitution.
1This work also uses the Link Grammar parser.
The purpose of our research is to explore the use
of a particular natural language processing (NLP)
approach for automated scoring of essays written
by ESL students at lower levels of language pro-
ficiency Our goal for the system reflects common-
sense (though ambitious) criteria: to have the sys-
tem?s scores agree with those assigned by human
raters at least as often as human raters agree among
themselves.
2 The parser
As mentioned above, one approach to grading is
to use a parsing system, along with its associated
knowledge sources, to analyze the correctness of
a text. The NLP field has produced a wide range
of parsers and grammars to support them. Most
of the widely used and highly accurate parsers are
closely (or even inalienably) tied to a particular syn-
tactic theory: XTAG with Tree-Adjoining Gram-
mar2, LFG-WB with Lexical-Functional Grammar3,
ALE with HPSG or Categorial Grammar4, and so
on. Principled coverage of grammatical phenomena
can thus be tied closely to the linguistic theory in
question. Some parsers are designed to skip over
ungrammatical and disfluent portions of input and
have been successfully applied to speech and dia-
logue processing (Rose?, 1997), with perhaps possi-
ble future application to rating ESL essays. There
are disadvanges to traditional parsers, though, which
offset their usefulness for automated grading.
Consider, for example, that the encoding of any
parser?s phrase-structure component is costly, com-
plex, and dependent on significant lexical resources.
This precludes involvement of the uninitiated. Even
2See http://www.cis.upenn.edu/?xtag/

4See http://www.cs.toronto.edu/?gpenn/ale.html
more serious is the lack of robustness that most
parsers entail. Most linguistic formalisms focus pre-
cisely on what is grammatical, and not on what
is ungrammatical. This often becomes an archi-
tectural assumption in the way parsers are imple-
mented. The result is that such systems are rather
inflexible, particularly in the face of ungrammatical
input?ungrammaticaly is almost always avoided in
both the theory and in its implementation. Yet cru-
cially for the essay grading ungrammatical input is
frequent and expected.
One method used to sidestep the robustness issue
is to explicitly encode rules reflecting ungrammati-
cality, called ?mal-rules? (McCoy et al, 1996). For
example, the following is a possible mal-rule for an
LFG parser:
S --> NP (agr ?a) VP (agr ??a)
This rule says that a sentence can consist of an NP
and a VP whose respective agreement features do
NOT agree. While such a technique allows for de-
tection of ungrammatical sentences, it introduces
two problems. First, the computational complex-
ity of a parsing system increases as such rules are
added to the phrase-structure component. Second,
maintaining a knowledge base of such information
is a complicated and never-ending proposition, as
student errors vary in a seemingly infinite number
of ways.
In our work we chose to use a different kind of
parser, the link grammer parser (Sleator and Tem-
perley, 1993). This parser has been developed for
robust, efficient processing of dependency-style syn-
tax (Grinberg et al, 1995). Freely available for re-
search purposes, it is more robust than traditional
parsers and has been widely used in such NLP appli-
cations as information retrieval, speech recognition,
and machine translation5. Written in the C program-
ming language, it is comparatively fast and efficient.
The link grammar parser does not seek to
construct constituents in the traditional linguistic
sense?instead, it calculates simple, explicit rela-
tions between pairs of words. A link is a targeted
relationship between two words and has two parts:
a left side and a right side. For example, links asso-
ciate such word pairs as: subject + verb, verb + ob-
ject, preposition + object, adjective + adverbial mod-
5For a bibliography see http://link.cs.cmu.edu/link/papers/
ifier, and auxiliary + main verb. Each link has a label
that expresses the nature of the relationship mediat-
ing the two words. Potential links are specified by a
set of technical rules that constrain and permit word-
pair associations. In addition, it is possible to score
individual linkages and to penalize unwanted links.
Figure 1 shows an example link parse of a sen-
tence from a student essay. Ten links of various
types span the various relationships observable in
the sentence.
When parses are not possible, the system?s robust-
ness allows it to discard words (or alternatively posit
spelling corrections) in order to arrive at a tenable
description of the input. Figure 2 shows two un-
grammatical sentences that the parser has nonethe-
less coped with. In the first, it skips over words that
don?t seem to fit into any grammatical pattern, pars-
ing instead a core sentence ?The class is mathemat-
ical.? The cost vector for this sentence records the
fact that there were 4 unused words. In the second
example, only one word must be discarded to arrive
at a reasonable parse.
The LG parser as distributed was not completely
suited to handle the grading of ESL students? es-
says, so some modifications had to be made. Lex-
ical items had to be added to the system?s lexicon
to cover terms frequently used by students, such
as acronyms: E.L.C. (the English Language Cen-
ter), R.O.C. (Republic of China), and so on. Other
constructions not supported in the standard release
were also added, for example variant ordering within
dates (e.g. 24 May as well as May 24). The grammar
as originally distributed did not allow for optional
commas where unexpected. It also did not penalize
certain ungrammatical constructions (e.g. missing
determiners, as in ?I am student of English.?) since
such constructions were not anticipated.
With the system slightly modified as described
above, it was well suited to parsing ESL essays. Two
more example parses of student essay sentences are
illustrated in Figure 3. In the next section we discuss
how it was used to score such essays.
3 The corpus
Our study involved using the LG parser to rate es-
says based on the results of a link parse for each sen-
tence. We used ESL essays written by Intensive En-

glish students who spanned a range of ability from
Novice-mid to Intermediate-high. The essays were
on a variety of assigned topics, and each had to be
written within a 30-minute time limit.
Our corpus consists of 301 human-rated essays in
total consisting of some 50,000 words and 3400 sen-
tences. These were sub-divided further by semester
into 5 sub-corpora. The essays exhibited the follow-
ing characteristics: each had (on average) 165 words
and 11.2 sentences, and each sentence had on aver-
age 14.75 words. Note the wide variety of errors in
this typical sentence from one essay:
Iwork really hard and occacionally
I don?t have time for have fun
whith mt friens but i don?t mind
becausse i knew ,when i grow up
i will have a profesion and have
a good job and i will be very
happy.
Each essay was given a holistic rating by two
human judges. Different raters participated each
semester, though there was likely a small degree of
overlap among raters across subsequent semesters.
Scores ranged from 1 to 5 with half-points possi-
ble (i.e. essays could receive 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5,
4, 4.5, and 5). Occasionally a judge gave a rating of
0 indicating that no comprehensible language was
present. Inter-rater agreement, where each human
assigned a score within one point of the other, was
98% over the corpora.
The following categories describe scoring levels:
1. Demonstrates limited ability to write English
words and sentences. Sentences and para-
graphs may be incomplete and difficult to fol-
low.
2. Writes a simple paragraph with a fair control
of basic, not complex, sentences structures. Er-
rors occur in almost all sentences except for the
most basic, formula-type (memorized) struc-
tures. Little detail is present.
3. Writes a fairly long paragraph with relatively
simple sentence structures. Personal experi-
ences and some emotions can be expressed,
but much detail is missing. Frequent errors in
grammar and word use make reading somewhat
burdensome.
4. Writes long groups of paragraphs with some
complex sentence patterns. Some transitions
are used effectively. Vocabulary is broaden-
ing, but some wrong word use. Grammar er-
rors may detract from meaning. Some ideas
are supported with detail. Some notion of an
introduction and conclusion is included.
5. Writes complex thoughts using complex sen-
tence patterns with effective transitions be-
tween ideas and sentences. Errors in gram-
mar exist but do not obscure meaning. A va-
riety of advanced vocabulary words are used
but some wrong use occurs, including problems
with prepositions and articles. Ideas are clearly
supported with details. Effective introduction
and conclusion are included.
Although judges gave a holistic rating based on
a number of features of the essay, the category de-
scriptions hint that syntax (and to some degree vo-
cabulary use) is the focus for at least categories 1
through 3, and even much of category 4.
4 Results and analysis
The corpus was partitioned into two classes: the de-
velopment set and the test set. The former was used
to develop and tune the system, and consisted of the
most recent set of essays (60 in number) dating from
Winter 2002 semester. The other 4 (earlier) corpora
were used for testing the system.
Each essay was sent through the LG parser a sen-
tence at a time, and each sentence was given a 5-
point score based on the parse?s cost vector. An
overall score for each essay was computed as the
average across sentence scores, after discarding the
lowest and highest ones. The overall score was
then compared with those of the human raters. For
the development set, the system agreed 67% of the
time with human raters, where agreement follows
the standardly accepted definition of falling within
1.0 of the closest human?s score. Note that since hu-
mans only gave ratings involving integers and half-
steps between them, all computer-generated scores
were rounded to the nearest integer or half-step as
appropriate.
The system was then run on the previously
unseen test corpus, actually consisting of essays
from four separate semesters. The test corpus scores
were as follows:
Fall01: 82 students 69.5% agreement
Summer01: 58 students 62.1% agreement
Winter01: 36 students 66.7% agreement
Winter92: 75 students 62.2% agreement
Hence over a corpus of some 300 essays and five
sub-corpora, system agreement with human raters
was achieved about 66% of the time. We now turn
to a brief analysis of interesting results that emerged
from the system?s performance.
Generally, the system tended to over-score essays
with very low human scores (i.e. those in the 1-
2 point range). It also tended to under-score es-
says with high human scores and complex run-on
sentences. This reflects the observation that run-on
sentences, which were very plentiful, were penal-
ized by the system but largely forgiven by human
raters. Also, the system?s scoring matched human
values better for midrange-scored essays, and worse
for extreme examples (i.e. with average score < 2
or > 4.5). Finally, system panics (when the system
ran out of allotted time without successfully parsing
a sentence) occurred most frequently when several
conjunctions appeared in a single sentence.
It is informative to look at an essay that reflects
one of the most extreme mismatches between human
and computer ratings. In this case, the two human
raters gave the essay scores of 1 and 2 respectively,
whereas the computer scored the essay at 4.40.
My free time is very fun. Because
I meet my friends. We goes to
play. For exmple, I went to
movies, recreation ground, trip
and shopping with them. I can?t
write English.
Another observation from the present work is that
performing a purely syntactic parse does not al-
ways assure appropriate ratings. The current sys-
tem?s scoring mechanism occasionally results in ar-
tificially high scores. Consider, for example, the
sentence in Figure 4. Even though there are no
egregious syntactic errors, violations of selectional
restriction, collocation, determiner selection, and
verbal aspect render the sentence highly unnatural,
though this is undetected by the current parser. Ad-
dition of hand-coded postprocessor rules may help
avoid such situations, and is possible with the parser.
5 Future work
There are several ways in which the base system de-
scribed in this paper can be improved. For instance,
sentence and essay scores are currently based on
straightforward values from the cost vector, whereas
more sophisticated measures can be implemented.
Future work will involve using statistical smooth-
ing to improve performance in the extreme (high-
scoring and low-scoring) situations.

The system could also achieve more human-like
scoring by integrating data-driven, exemplar-based
approaches. Training the system to relate salient fea-
tures and vector costs of the essays with the corre-
sponding human scores can be done using any of
a variety of available techniques, such as memory-
based learning or analogical modeling.
Finally, further linguistic processing can improve
the system. Some syntactic improvements can be
made, including specifying licit structures that are
not recognized as well as unacceptable structures
with their associated coses. As mentioned above,
pushing the analysis beyond a syntactic LG parse
will be necessary. This might involve leveraging
resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) for
providing lexical semantic information which could
prove useful in scoring compounding strategies, col-
locations, and verb argument structure formation.
Current research in discourse processing using such
devices as centering, anaphor/coreference, coher-
ence, and topic continuity can also be integrated into
the system as has been done in other scoring pro-
grams.
In addition, the LG parser is also being developed
for other languages (e.g. French and Spanish) with
the eventual goal of providing a scoring engine for
learners of these languages as well.
6 Conclusions
We have shown how the output from a non-
traditional syntactic parser can be used to grade ESL
essays. With a robust enough parser, reasonable re-
sults can be obtained, even for highly ungrammati-
cal text. We anticipate that this foundation can be
improved upon by using other commonly adopted
NLP techniques. Its applicability should extend to
other languages besides English given a comparable
LG parser implementation.
