Syntactic coindexing restrictions are by now known to be of central importance to practical 
anaphor esolution approaches. Since, in particular due to structural ambiguity, the assumption 
of the availability of a unique syntactic reading proves to be unrealistic, robust anaphor esolution 
relies on techniques to overcome this deficiency. 
This paper describes the ROSANA approach, which generalizes the verification of coindexing 
restrictions in order to make it applicable to the deficient syntactic descriptions that are provided 
by a robust state-of-the-art parser. By a formal evaluation on two corpora that differ with respect 
to text genre and domain, it is shown that ROSANA achieves high-quality robust coreference 
resolution. Moreover, by an in-depth analysis, it is proven that the robust implementation of
syntactic disjoint reference isnearly optimal. The study reveals that, compared with approaches 
that rely on shallow preprocessing, the largely nonheuristic disjoint reference algorithmization 
opens up the possibility/or a slight improvement. Furthermore, it is shown that more significant 
gains are to be expected elsewhere, particularly from a text-genre-specific choice of preference 
strategies. 
The performance study of the ROSANA system crucially rests on an enhanced evaluation 
methodology for coreference r solution systems, the development ofwhich constitutes the second 
major contribution o/the paper. As a supplement tothe model-theoretic scoring scheme that was 
developed for the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) evaluations, additional evaluation 
measures are defined that, on one hand, support he developer of anaphor esolution systems, and, 
on the other hand, shed light on application aspects of pronoun interpretation. 
1. In t roduct ion  
The interpretation of anaphoric expressions i known to be a difficult problem. In 
principle, a variety of constraints and preference heuristics, including factors that rely 
on semantic, pragmatic, and world knowledge, contribute to this task (Carbonell and 
Brown 1988). Robust, operational approaches to anaphor esolution on unrestricted 
discourse, however, are confined to strategies exploiting globally available evidence 
like morphosyntactic, syntactic, and surface information. 
Beginning with the pioneering work of Hobbs (1978), many practical approaches 
rely on the availability of syntactic surface structure by employing coindexing re- 
strictions, salience criteria, and parallelism heuristics (e.g., Lappin and Leass 1994). 
However, even the assumption of the availability of a unique syntactic description is
unrealistic since, in general, parsing involves the solution of difficult problems like at-

tachment ambiguities, role uncertainty, and the instantiation ofempty categories. Based 
on this observation, Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) have suggested an adaptation of 
Lappin and Leass's approach to the shallow analysis frontend of English Constraint 
Grammar (Karlsson et al 1995), which provides a part-of-speech tagging compris- 
ing an assignment of syntactic function but no constituent s ructure. This information 
deficiency is partly overcome by the application of a regular filter that heuristically 
reconstructs parts of the constituent s ructure. An alternative solution, which is based 
on the possibly partial but potentially more comprehensive and reliable output of a 
conventional parser, has been suggested in Stuckardt (1997). 
In the present paper, an approach to robust anaphor esolution is developed that 
enhances the latter work. The coreference r solution algorithm ROSANA l is devel- 
oped, the core of which consists of a set of rule patterns by means of which the 
verification of disjoint reference rules is generalized in order to make it applicable to 
deficient (fragmentary) syntactic descriptions. Based on this algorithm, the ROSANA 
system, which works on the partial syntactic descriptions generated by the robust 
FDG (Functional Dependency Grammar of English) parser of J~irvinen and Tapanainen 
(1997), is implemented. By a formal evaluation on two text corpora that differ with 
respect to genre and domain, it is proven that ROSANA achieves robust (truly opera- 
tional) high-quality coreference r solution on unrestricted texts. An in-depth analysis 
shows that the robust implementation f syntactic disjoint reference is nearly opti- 
mal. Compared with approaches that rely on a combination of shallow preprocess- 
ing and heuristic syntactic disjoint reference, the largely nonheuristic disjoint refer- 
ence algorithmization employed by ROSANA opens up the possibility for a slight 
improvement. 
The performance study of the ROSANA system crucially rests on an enhancement 
of the evaluation methodology for coreference r solution systems, the development 
of which constitutes the second major contribution of the paper. As a supplement to 
the coreference class scoring scheme that was developed for the CO-task evaluation 
of the Message Understanding Conferences (Vilain et al 1996), two additional eval- 
uation disciplines are defined that, on one hand, aim at supporting the developer of 
anaphor esolution systems, and, on the other hand, shed light on application aspects of 
pronoun interpretation. The evaluation of ROSANA according to the refined scoring 
scheme gives evidence that the interpretation quality may be improved by a genre- 
specific choice of the preference factors and their relative weights. This demonstrates 
the usefulness of enhancing the evaluation methodology for coreference r solution 
systems. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the robustness i sue of natural 
language processing is briefly discussed at a general level, and two models of robust 
anaphor esolution are introduced. In Section 3, by deriving a set of disjoint refer- 
ence rule patterns for fragmentary s ntax, the core component of a robust, operational 
anaphor esolution algorithm is developed. In Section 4, the ROSANA algorithm is 
designed, and an implementation, the ROSANA system, is described. In Section 5, 
an enhanced set of evaluation disciplines for coreference r solution systems is advo- 
cated for, and the respective formal measures are defined. In Section 6, the evaluation 
results of ROSANA are discussed. Finally, in section 7, ROSANA is compared with 
other approaches to anaphor esolution and, in particular, robust syntactic disjoint 
reference.

2. Anaphor Resolution and the Robustness Issue 
2.1 Robustness in Natural Language Processing 
In natural language processing in general, the robustness i sue comprises the ability of 
a software system to cope with input that gives rise to deficient descriptions at some 
descriptive layer. 2More or less implicit is the assumption that the system exhibits ome 
kind of monotonic behavior: the less deficient he description, the higher the quality of 
the output (Menzel 1995). 
Following Menzel further, this intuitive characterization may be refined. The pro- 
cessing should exhibit autonomy in the sense that complete failures at one stage of 
analysis hould not cause complete failures at other stages of analysis or even a fail- 
ure of the overall processing. Moreover, the processing model should ideally employ 
some kind of interaction between different stages of analysis: deficiency at one stage 
of analysis hould be compensated by evidence gained at other stages. 
2.2 Two Models of Robust Anaphor Resolution 
In light of the above characterization, the robustness requirement for the anaphor 
resolution task may be rendered more precisely. In the aforementioned operational 
approaches, a sequential processing model is followed according to which anaphor resolu- 
tion is performed by referring to the result of an already completed syntactic analysis. Un- 
der this architecture, vidence for structural disambiguation that may be contributed 
by strong expectations at the referential layer is not taken into account (Stuckardt 
1996). In terms of the general goals of robust processing, since there is no interac- 
tion, this implies that the robustness requirement only shows up in the form of the 
monotonicity and autonomy demands: the anaphor esolution module has to cope 
with deficient or shallow syntactic information. Besides the trivial way of achieving 
this kind of robustness by simply not exploiting deficient syntactic descriptions, the 
following two models may be employed: 
the shallow description model: by employing heuristic rules to partially 
reconstruct the syntactic description, the anaphor esolution strategies 
are adapted to shallow input data that are never defective; 3 
the deficient description model: by extending anaphor esolution 
strategies to work on a possibly ambiguous or incomplete description, 
syntactic evidence isexploited as far as available. 
In contrast to the approach of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), which follows the shallow 
description model, the ROSANA algorithm is based on the deficient description model. 
In principle, even a "complete" algorithm that establishes the conceptually superior 
degree of robustness by means of interaction between structural disambiguation and 
anaphor esolution is feasible (Stuckardt 1997). As will become vident, however, the 
technically less complex sequential strategy employed by ROSANA already yields 
high-quality results and does not leave much room for further improvement. 
2 The deficiency may result either because the input itself is deficient or from shortcomings of the 
processing resources (e.g., lexicon, grammar/parser, o  semantic/pragmatic d sambiguation). 
3 Here, the monotonicity demand of intuitive robustness virtually vanishes, since there is no longer a 
syntactic input prone to deficiency.

2.3 Fragmentary Syntax 
The main phenomena that give rise to structural ambiguity of syntactic descriptions 
are uncertainty of syntactic function (involving subject and direct object) and attachment 
ambiguities of prepositional phrases, relative clauses, and adverbial clauses. In example 
(1), 
(1) Peter observed the man with the telescope. 
depending on the availability of disambiguating information, it may be uncertain 
whether the underlined prepositional phrase with the telescope should be interpreted 
adverbially or attributively. From the configurational perspective, these ambiguities 
give rise to fragmentary syntactic descriptions that consist of several tree-shaped 
components. With the exception of the topmost ree fragment, all components cor- 
respond to a constituent of type PP, S, or NP whose attachment or role assignment 
failed. 
In addition, cases in which no reading exists give rise to fragmentary syntactic de- 
scriptions comprising the constituents whose combination failed due to constraint 
violation. 
2.4 Fragmentary Syntax and Anaphor Resolution 
Among the anaphor esolution strategies potentially affected by fragmentary syntax 
are both heuristics and constraints. Preference criteria like salience factors and syntactic 
parallelism are not affected by all types of syntactic defects. Moreover, there are many 
heuristics that do not rely on syntactic function or structure. Structural coindexing 
constraints, however, may lose evidence in all the above cases of fragmentary syntax. 
Since they are known to be of central importance to the antecedent-filtering phase of 
operational anaphor esolution approaches, the subsequent discussion focuses on the 
impact of deficient surface structure description on disjoint reference restrictions. 
By referring to Chomsky's Government and Binding (GB) Theory, the core of the 
syntactic oindexing restrictions may be stated as follows (Chomsky 1981): 4
Definition 
Binding principles A, B, and C: 
(A) A reflexive or reciprocal is bound in its binding category. 
(B) A pronoun is free (i.e., not bound) in its binding category. 
(C) A referring expression 3 is free in any domain. 
where binding category denotes the next surface-structural dominator containing 
some kind of subject, and binding is defined as coindexed and c-commanding: 
4 Various theoretical models that cover disjoint reference phenomena h ve been stated. Since the disjoint 
reference onditions are descriptive principles of grammar, the choice of the theoretical model is, in this 
sense, arbitrary. In the subsequent discussion, the comprehensive and widely known GB Theory is 
referred to. 
5 For example, common ouns and names. 
482 
Stuckardt A Robust Anaphor Resolution Algorithm 
Definition 
Surface structure node X c-commands node Y if and only if the next branching node that 
dominates X also dominates Y and it is not the case that X dominates Y, Y dominates 
X, or X = Y. 
The following examples illustrate the scope of the binding principles: 
(2) a. The barber/is having himselfi/*himi. 
b. The client/wants that the barberj shaves ,himselfi/himi. 
c. ,The client/wants that the barberj shaves the client/. 
In sentence (2a), whereas the reflexive himself is required to be coindexed with the local 
subject he barber (binding principle A), coindexing the pronoun him with the subject 
is ruled out (binding principle B) because, otherwise, the pronoun would be locally 
bound in its binding category. Sentence (2b) illustrates the case of nonlocal binding 
(here: outside the embedded sentence), which is admissible only in the case of the 
nonreflexive pronoun. As illustrated by sentence (2c) and modeled by binding princi- 
ple C, referring expressions (e.g., common nouns and names) are not even allowed to 
be bound nonlocally. 
A further structural well-formedness condition, commonly called the i-within- 
i condition, aims at ruling out certain instances of referential circularity, that is, coin- 
dexings matching the pattern \[c~ ... \[fl...\]i\]i (Chomsky 1981, page 212). It is motivated 
by cases like (3): 
(3) *Mary knows \[the owner of hisi boat\]/. 
The following example illustrates that syntactic fragmentation may interfere with the 
application of syntactic disjoint reference conditions: 
(4) Peter observed the owner of the telescope with it. 
In (4), the i-within-i condition possibly applies: 6 the coindexing of telescope and it is 
admissible only if the PP containing it is not interpreted as an attribute to telescope-- 
otherwise, in violation of the i-within-i condition, the pronoun would be contained 
in the NP of the tentative antecedent. Hence, if the PP attachment ambiguity has not 
6 Since the (maximal projection of the) NP with head telescope dominates the NP of it, the former NP 
does not c-command the latter. Hence, coindexing the two NPs does not induce a relation of (local) 
binding, which implies that binding principle B does not apply in this case. 
If one assumes the applicability of the i-within-i condition defined as above, however, there are two 
classes of cases that do not seem to be appropriately distinguished: 
(i) Peter observed the owner of \[the telescope near itsi factory\]/. 
(ii) *Peter destroyed \[a picture of its/frame\]i. 
Whereas in (i), where the possessive occurs in an adjunct phrase of the telescope NP, coindexing may be 
judged admissible, in (ii), where the possessive occurs in a complement phrase, coindexing seems to be 
inadmissible. If, however, the scope of the i-within-i condition were restricted to the complement cases 
(ii), then, since binding principle B does not apply, case (4) would remain unaccounted for. Whereas, in 
theory, it is widely agreed that the original definition of the i-within-i condition may be somewhat oo 
strong (e.g., Chomsky 1981, page 212), with respect o the practical task of robust anaphor resolution, 
as the formal evaluations below will demonstrate, the original i-within-i condition is sufficient. In 
corpora, cases like (i) seem to be exceptional. 
483 
Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4 
been resolved prior to anaphor esolution, the fragmentary syntactic description does 
not contribute the configurational evidence necessary for definitely confirming the 
antecedent candidate telescope. 
3. Checking Binding Constraints on Fragmentary Syntax 
3.1 Basic Observations 
The first step toward the verification of binding constraints on fragmentary syntax is 
suggested by the following observation: if both the anaphor and the antecedent candidate are 
contained in the same connected component of the fragmentary s ntactic description, o (direct) 
binding-theoretic evidence is lost. In this case, it will be possible to verify the binding 
restrictions of anaphor and antecedent in a nonheuristic manner, since the necessary 
positive (--* binding principle A) and negative (---+ binding principles B, C) syntactic- 
configurational evidence is entirely available. 7 However, even in the disadvantageous 
case in which the anaphor and the antecedent candidate occur in different surface 
structure fragments, a closer look at the fragments may reveal additional information. 
3.2 An Example 
The following example illustrates a typical case: 8
(5) Der Mann hat den Pr~isidenten besucht, der ihn von sich i~berzeugte. 
the man has the president visited who him of himself convinced 
'The man visited the president who convinced him of himself.' 
Because of the intervening past participle, the relative clause may be interpreted as an 
attribute to either Mann or Pr~sidenten. Hence, syntactic ambiguity arises, yielding a 
surface structure description that consists of the following two fragments: 9 
(S Mann 
(VP Pr~sidenten) ) 
(S der 
(VP ihn 
(VP (PP sich)))) 
In addition, it is known that the second fragment is embedded in the first. There 
are three pronominal anaphors to be resolved: the reflexive pronoun sich of binding- 
theoretic type A, the nonreflexive pronoun ihn of type B, and the relative pronoun der 
of type B. 
Regarding the reflexive pronoun sich, it can be shown that binding-theoretic ev- 
idence is completely available. Clearly, this holds with respect o the candidates der 
and ihn, which are contained in the same surface structure fragment. However, even 
regarding the two candidates Mann and Prf~sidenten that occur in the other fragment, 
there is no loss of evidence: since the reflexive pronoun is of binding-theoretic type A, 
and the fragment in which it occurs contains its binding category (the S node of the 
7 However, this statement applies olely to the direct comparison ofthe involved occurrences, since in 
case of further, transitive coindexings, negative evidence stemming from decision interdependency may 
get lost (cf. Section 4.1). 
8 The example isgiven in German because the structural mbiguity emerges more strikingly. 
9 For the sake of readability, parts of the constituent structure are omitted. 
484

relative clause), according to binding principle A both candidates may be definitively 
ruled out. 
Similar observations can be made regarding the pronouns ihn and der, for which 
binding principle B applies: the two candidates Mann and Priisidenten are recognized 
as configurationally admissible. In this case, besides the binding category condition, it 
is decisive that their fragment is known to be embedded in the antecedent's fragments. 1?
3.3 Rule Patterns 
In the subsequent discussion, pairs of anaphors a and antecedent candidates 3' are 
considered that occur in different surface syntactic fragments. The goal is to determine 
whether coindexing a and 3' (as in the case of actually choosing 3' as the antecedent 
of a) complies with the above-stated binding-theoretic conditions. Since, according to 
the definition of the binding principles, no asymmetric distinction between anaphor 
and candidate is drawn, the disjoint reference requirements of both a and 3' must  be 
taken into account. 
By an abstraction over cases like the ones discussed in Section 3.2, a set of rule pat- 
terns can be designed by means of which the verification of syntactic disjoint reference 
is generalized in order to make it applicable to f ragmentary syntactic descriptions (cf. 
Figure 1). 11 As illustrated by example (5), there are two classes of patterns. 12 One class 
(five patterns, labeled " , " )  matches cases in which, according to the binding princi- 
ples, coindexing the anaphor a and the antecedent candidate 3' is ruled out; the other 
class (three patterns, labeled "v/ ' )  applies in certain cases where no binding principle 
is violated and coindexing is therefore admissible. By the binding principles, conditions 
regarding, on one hand, the presence or absence of a c-command relation, and, on the 
other hand, the locality or nonlocality of this relation, are stated. The rule patterns are 
designed to match fragmentary cases in which at least one condition of either anaphor 
or candidate is violated (" , "  patterns), or cases in which all conditions of anaphor and 
candidate are satisfied ("v/" patterns). Figure 2 explicates the specific conditions the 
different patterns aim at. Three patterns apply in certain cases of binding principle A 
violation (\[E2\]: missing locality; \[E4\]: missing c-command relation; \[F2\]: either miss- 
ing locality or missing c-command relation). Another two patterns cover instances of 
binding principle C violation (\[E3a\], \[E3b\]: c -command relation). Three other patterns 
match cases of binding principle B satisfaction (IF1\], \[Ela\], \[Elb\]: nonlocality). 
This collection of rules may be supplemented with further patterns employing 
more sophisticated conditions regarding the fragments to be matched. 13 The actual 
choice of rule patterns, however, should depend on the parser that is used. As will 
10 It is evident hat there are cases in which the latter condition does not hold and the coindexing would 
violate binding principle C. 
11 The following notational conventions are used: round brackets delimit constituents; square brackets 
emphasize fragment boundaries; bc(X) denotes the binding category of surface structure node X; bn(X) 
denotes the branching node dominating X according to the c-command definition; the subscript of 
Xtype y denotes that the binding-theoretic class of the occurrence contributed by X is Y C {A, B, C}; for 
example, PtypeB is a pronoun. ~//* indicate the prediction of the particular pattern, that is, whether, in 
structural configurations matching the pattern, coindexing isadmissible or ruled out. 
12 Example (5) illustrates an instance of syntactic fragmentation that is due to structural ambiguity. The 
rule patterns, however, are general in the sense that they also cover cases of fragmentary s ntactic 
description that are induced by parsing constraint violation (cf. Section 2.3). 
13 For example, patterns may be added that match instances of binding principle B violation, that is, cases in 
which one occurrence oftype B is locally c-commanded bythe other occurrence. To recognize such cases, 
two conditions must be verified, one requiring that one occurrence c-command the other (of type B) 
regardless of the attachment choice, the other requiring that the fragment of the latter occurrence not 
contain the occurrence's binding category. Similar conditions may be employed for recognizing 
instances of binding principle A satisfaction.

is applicable in cases where two nonreflexive (type B) p ronouns  c~ and -y are contained 
in different surface structure fragments,  and, in addit ion, each f ragment contains the

applies in cases where a reflexive pronoun a occurs in a syntactic fragment hat con- 
tains its binding category: any candidate q? of arbitrary binding-theoretic type (A, B, 
or C) that occurs in a different fragment containing its branching node (bn) may be 
ruled out on configurational grounds since it is impossible to structurally conjoin the 
two fragments in such a way that % as required by binding principle A of ~, locally 
binds c~. Here, the condition that the binding category be present in the anaphor's 
fragment ensures that, in case this fragment is subordinated under the candidate's 
fragment, no relation of local binding holds; on the other hand, the condition that the 
branching node be present in the candidate's fragment rules out, in the opposite case, 
the possibility of establishing a c-command relation. IF2\] is applicable in the case of 
example (5). Since the relative clause contains a reflexive pronoun (taken as anaphor 
~) and the respective binding category, it matches the fragment Fj; similarly, the main 
clause instantiates Fi with respect o any of its type C occurrences (taken as candidates 
"~). Hence, according to the prediction of \[F2\], the immediate, constructive TM coindexing 
of the reflexive pronoun with any of the candidates occurring in the main clause is 
ruled out. 
For certain adjacent syntactic fragments, the parsing result may comprise addi- 
tional information about immediate or transitive mbedding. Based on this evidence, 
further rule patterns may become applicable (Fd = dominating fragment, Fe = embed- 
ded fragment): 
Rule patterns \[Elal and \[Elb\]

are the (enhanced) counterparts of pattern \[F1\]. If the fragment of the type B anaphor 
is subordinated, coindexing with an outside candidate ,~ (here: arbitrarily of type 
A, B, or C) is admissible. If, on the other hand, the fragment of the type B (or type 
C) anaphor ~ is known to be the dominator, a candidate ~ of type B that occurs in 
a fragment containing its binding category is configurationally permitted, is Hence, 
because of the additionally available embedding information, it is possible to relax 
the demands on the dominating fragment, which is no longer required to contain 
the binding category of the respective occurrence. Typical cases in which \[Ela\] and 
\[Elb\] apply are instances of structurally ambiguous relative clauses. In example (5), 
since the (embedded) relative clause fragment contains the binding category of the 
nonreflexive (type B) pronoun occurrences (taken as anaphors ~), fragment Fe of rule 
\[Ela\] is instantiated; moreover, trivially, the (dominating) main clause instantiates Fa 
14 While binding principle A constructively demands the existence ofat least one local binder, it does not 
preclude further, possibly nonlocal coindexings (cf. the example in Section 4.1). In this sense, the 
application of \[F2\] isconfined to the constructive s arch for the antecedent required to fulfill binding 
principle A. 
15 In the case of \[Elbl, the anaphor (i.e., the occurrence tobe constructively resolved) occurs in the 
dominating fragment. Since 3" cannot be a local binder of c~, the occurrence in the dominating fragment 
is not allowed to be of type A (cf. the remarks on constructive coindexing in footnote 14). Hence, since 
c~ and 3' are not interchangeable, \[Ela\] and \[Elb\] look slightly different.

? {. . .  1% = \[... 3"~ypeA/B/C ...1 . . . . .  Fe = \[.. .  bc(~)(...~yp~A ...) ...\] . . .  } 
is the counterpart of pattern \[F2\]. Under the condition that the anaphor's fragment is 
known to be subordinated, the restriction that the candidate's fragment contain the 
respective branching node can be dropped; the presence of the reflexive pronoun's 
binding category in the embedded fragment proves to be sufficient for ruling out 
the candidate as the constructive antecedent required according to binding principle 
A. Again, applied to example (5), \[E2\] rules out the constructive coindexing of the 
reflexive pronoun with any candidate occurring in the main clause. 
Rule patterns lE3a\] and \[E3b\] 
* { "'" Fd = \ [ " "  3"typeA/B/C " ' ' \ ]  . . . . .  Fe = \ [ . . ,  OqypeC . . . \ ]  . . .  },

* { . . .  Fd = \ [ . . .  OqypeA/B/C . . . \ ]  . . . . .  Fe = \ [ . . .  3"typeC . . . \ ]  . . .  }, 
if c~ c-commands 3' regardless of the attachment choice 
formally characterize a particular case in which binding principle C is violated: if a type 
C expression occurs in the embedded fragment, and, in addition, it is known that the 
other occurrence will c-command the type C expression regardless of the attachment 
choice, then this coindexing can be definitively ruled out since, in any case, binding 
principle C will be violated. Typically, these rules apply if the expression occurring in 
the dominating fragment holds the structurally prominent role of the syntactic subject. 
Rule  pattern \[E41 
? {. . .  F~ = I. . .  c~typeA ...\] . . . . .  I:e = \[... bn('y)(...'YtypeA/B/C...) .\] 
deals with another generic ase of binding principle A violation. If the type A pronoun 
occurs in the dominating fragment, and, in addition, the subordinated fragment con- 
tains the branching node of a constructive candidate 3' of arbitrary binding-theoretic 
type, this candidate can be ruled out since, in any possible case of structural recombi- 
nation, 3" will not c-command c~; in particular, this implies that, as required by binding 
principle A, 3" does not (locally) bind c~. Since the requirement on the constructive 
candidate's fragment is weak, pattern \[E4\] applies in virtually any case in which a 
reflexive pronoun occurs in a dominating fragment. 
In general, there may be more than one rule pattern applying to a certain configura- 
tion. 16 However, the set of patterns is consistent in the sense that, whenever this situa- 
tion arises, the predictions of all applicable rules are identical. 
There are two further rule patterns that match certain syntactic onfigurations in 
which a coindexing would violate the i-within-i condition (cf. Figure 3). Both patterns 
are abstractions over cases of fragment embedding in which the root of the dominating 
fragment constitutes one of the relevant occurrences. Thus, the scope of the i-within-i 
patterns is rather restricted. As an example, if there is a dominating NP fragment (con- 
stituting an antecedent candidate 3") and a locally ambiguous PP fragment containing 
an anaphor a, \[IEa\] rules out coindexing the anaphor's NP with the overall NP. 
16 For example, \[F2\] as well as \[E2\] in the case of the reflexive pronoun in example (5).

4. Anaphor Resolution on Fragmentary Syntax: The ROSANA System 
Based on the above set of rule patterns, an anaphor esolution algorithm can be de- 
signed that achieves robustness against fragmentary syntactic descriptions according 
to the deficient description model. 
4.1 The ROSANA Algorithm 
Figure 4 describes the ROSANA algorithm. By applying a set of restrictions (Step 1) 
prior to a set of preferences (Step 2), this algorithm follows Carbonell and Brown's (1988) 
fundamental strategy by means of which the candidate set is narrowed own as early 
as possible. In Step 3, the actual selection of antecedents akes place. Among the strate- 
gies to be applied are restrictions (e.g., morphosyntactic and lexical congruence, dis- 
joint reference conditions) and a plethora of preference factors (subject/topicalization 
salience, syntactic obliqueness, recency, cataphor penalty, parallelism \[inertia of syn- 
tactic function\]). Since the goal is to design an anaphor esolution algorithm, the choice 
is restricted to strategies that are operational. 
With respect o syntactic disjoint reference, the central goal of robustness against 
fragmentary syntax is achieved in Steps l(b) and 3(b). As described above, if the 
considered occurrences are situated in different syntactic fragments, the rule patterns 
come into play; the actual set of patterns to be applied depends on whether or not 
it is known that one of the fragments is embedded in the other. Patterns labeled "," 
are used to eliminate candidates (Steps l(b)iv and l(b)v). Patterns marked "x/" are 
used to definitively admit candidates (Step l(b)vi), contrasting with heuristic admittance 
(Step l(b)vii), which entails a decrement of the plausibility score in Step 2(a). 
One subtlety taken into account is interdependency between different antecedent 
decisions (cf. Step 3). In particular, decision interdependency may arise because of the 
transitivity of the coindexing relation. As illustrated by the following example, even 
regarding intersentential naphora, antecedent decisions that individually comply with 
the disjoint reference conditions may collectively induce a violation: 
(7) *Gropiusi discusses the plans with Behrens/. Hei meets himi in Dessau. 
For each of the two pronouns, candidate Gropius is configurationally admissible. In 
a formal sense, however, the binding principles state restrictions on (intrasentential) 
index distributions rather than on single anaphor-candidate pairs in isolation: in the 
example, binding principle B of the pronoun him is transitively violated. In explicitly 
checking for the binding-theoretic admissibility of transitively induced coindexings, 
the algorithm guards against such cases (Step 3(b)). However, care must be taken not to 
apply the binding restriction for reflexives constructively in this test since, as illustrated 
in the following example, besides demanding constructively one local binder, binding 
principle A does not rule out further nonlocal coindexings: 
(8) Gropiusi admits that hei shaves himself/.

1. Candidate filtering: For each anaphoric NP c~, determine the set of admissible 
antecedents 3': 
(a) verify morphosyntactic or lexical agreement with "y; 
(b) if the antecedent candidate ~, is intrasentential: 
? if c~ and 3' belong to the same syntactic fragment, then verify 
that 
i. the binding restriction of c~ is constructively satisfied, 
ii. the binding restriction of 3' is not violated, 
iii. no i-within-i configuration results; 
? else (c~ and ,y belong to different syntactic fragments) try the 
rule patterns: 
iv. if one of the patterns \[E2\], \[E3a\], \[E3b\], \[E4\], or \[F2\] is 
matched, then some binding restrictions are violated, 
v. else if one of the two i-within-i rule patterns applies, 
then some binding restrictions are violated, 
vi. else if pattern \[Ela\], \[Elb\], or \[F1\] applies, 
then the binding restrictions of c~ and -y are satisfied, 
vii. else (no rule pattern applies) assume heuristically 
that the binding restrictions of c~ and 3' are satisfied; 
(c) if c~ is a type B pronoun, antecedent candidate 3" is intrasentential, and, 
with respect o surface order, 3' follows c~, verify that 3' is definite. 
2. Candidate scoring and sorting: 
(a) For each remaining anaphor-candidate pair (c~i,3'j): based on a set of 
preference heuristics, determine the numerical plausibility score v(c~i, 3"j). 
If the binding-theoretic admissibility was approved heuristically in step 
l(b)vii, then reduce the plausibility score v(c~i, 3"j) by a constant value; 
(b) for each anaphor c~: sort candidates 3"j according to decreasing 
plausibility v(c~, 3'j); 
(c) sort the anaphors c~ according to decreasing plausibility of their 
respective best antecedent candidates. 
3. Antecedent selection: Consider anaphors c~ in the order determined in Step 2(c). 
Suggest antecedent candidates -yj(c~) in the order determined in Step 2(b). 
Select 3"j(c~) as candidate if there is no interdependency, that is, if 
(a) the morphosyntactic features of c~ and "~j(c~) are still compatible, 
(b) for all occurrences ~j(~) and 6~ the coindexing of which with 3"j(c~) and 
(respectively) c~ has been determined in the current invocation of the 
algorithm: the coindexing of ~,j(~ and ~,  which results transitively 
when choosing Vj(c~) as antecedent for c~, violates neither the binding 
principles nor the i-within-i condition; that is, 
? if ~,j/~ and 6~ belong to the same syntactic fragment, then, for 
both occurrences, verify the respective binding conditions and 
the i-within-i condition according to steps l(b)ii and l(b)iii, 
? else if 6~j/~ ) and 6~ belong to different syntactic fragments, 
then proceed according to steps l(b)iv, l(b)v, l(b)vi, and l(b)vii 
(with the exception of the rule patterns \[F2\], \[E2\], and \[E4I, by 
means of which binding principle A is constructively verified). 
(The case ~,j(~) = ~,j(c~) /~ 6~ = c~ does not need to be reconsidered.)

Stuckardt A Robust Anaphor Resolution Algorithm 
The same distinction is drawn in Step l(b): whereas, regarding the anaphor, the binding 
restriction is verified in the strong, constructive sense (Step l(b)i), the candidate's 
restriction is applied in its weak version (Step l(b)ii). In the rule patterns for the 
fragmentary case, this subtlety is reflected implicitly in the sense that only regarding 
occurrence c~ (taken as the anaphor to be constructively resolved) is the strong version 
of binding principle A checked; hence, in the interdependency test Step 3(b), patterns 
IF2\], \[E2\], and \[E4\] are not taken into consideration. 
4.2 Implementation: The ROSANA System 
Based on the algorithm described in Figure 4, the ROSANA anaphor esolution sys- 
tem has been implemented (Stuckardt 2000). In primarily aiming at determining the 
coreference classes of nonzero linguistic expressions that specify entities, 17 the scope 
of ROSANA corresponds to the coreference task of the Message Understanding Con- 
ferences (cf. Hirschman 1998). ROSANA handles a broad range of entity-specifying 
expressions--in particular, ordinary, possessive, reflexive/reciprocal, nd relative pro- 
nouns, definite NPs, and names. The ROSANA system has been implemented in Com- 
mon Lisp. In an evaluation on a set of news agency press releases (cf. Section 6), the 
runtime of the ROSANA system (without parser) was 165 tokens per second on a 
Pentium PC. 
The FDG parser for English developed by Jarvinen and Tapanainen (1997) has been 
chosen as the syntactic preprocessor, is In giving robustness and processing speed pri- 
ority over normativity and syntactic overage of the underlying rammar, the parser 
meets the requirements on a preprocessor for robust anaphor resolution on unre- 
stricted texts29 Regardless of the typical parsing problems like structurally ambiguous 
or grammatically incorrect input, the parser always yields a result, comprising one 
or more syntactic fragments that cover the analyzed sentence. Hence, the parser is 
regarded to be an ideal associate of robust anaphor esolution approaches that follow 
the deficient description model. 
4.3 Anaphoric Occurrences and Antecedent Candidates 
In the ROSANA system, the above algorithm is supplemented by a set of strategies for 
identifying occurrences (linguistic expressions that specify entities) and classifying them 
as anaphors to be resolved and/or  as possible antecedent candidates. The criterion for 
the identification of specifying expressions i based on part of speech (as determined 
by the FDG parser) and syntactic ontext (Stuckardt 2000, page 249). 2o Also, the de- 
cision of anaphoricity is based on evidence regarding the syntactic ontext: generally, 
occurrences of all three binding-theoretic types (A, B, C) are taken to be anaphoric; 21
however, there are some classes of anaphoric occurrences that may, in certain cases, 
be interpreted in advance (outside the ROSANA core algorithm) by purely structural 
means (e.g., relative pronouns or occurrences induced by heads of appositions). For 
narrowing down the search space, occurrences of type A (reflexive and reciprocal pro- 
17 In contrast to expressions that, for example, specify events. 
18 Since the parser generates dependency descriptions rather than constituent s ructure (to which the 
formal definitions of the above GB-theoretic statement ofsyntactic disjoint reference r fer), ROSANA 
applies a preprocessor that reconstructs the structural (e.g., subject-object) asymmetries of constituency 
that are vital to the verification of the disjoint reference conditions. 
19 According to J/irvinen and Tapanainen (1997), the FDG parser processes an average of 350 words per 
second on modest hardware (Pentium PC, 166 MHz). 
20 Syntactic context plays a role, for example, indeciding whether the expression her is a possessive or
nonpossessive pronoun. 
21 In the case of nonpronominal NPs, it proves to be difficult o decide algorithmically (e.g., based on 
information about he determiner) whether or not a new discourse referent is introduced. 
491 
Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4 
nouns) are not taken into account as antecedent candidates, ince the existence of a 
cospecifying alternative in the same clause remains guaranteed. 
4.4 Congruence Conditions 
In Step l(a) of the ROSANA algorithm, the details regarding the congruence restric- 
tions are left unspecified. In the ROSANA system, depending on the specific type of 
anaphoric expression, different morphosyntactic or lexical agreement conditions are 
employed. For names, for example, a partial matching of the antecedent and anaphor 
expressions (in the sense of surname identity) is considered sufficient. Regarding third 
person pronouns (including possessives and reflexives/reciprocals), congruence of the 
morphological features number and person is considered mandatory; however, congru- 
ence of the gender attribute is taken to be optional, since, on one hand, there are some 
well-known exceptions, and, on the other hand, the available grammatical gender in- 
formation is not always correct. 22 In any case, candidates that also match the gender 
attribute of the anaphor are preferred. 
4.5 Salience Factors and Weights 
As in the approaches of Lappin and Leass (1994) and Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), 
weighted salience factors are employed for scoring and choosing among the candi- 
dates that remain after restriction application (cf. Step 2(a) of the ROSANA algorithm). 
Since the goal is to develop an operational pproach for unrestricted texts, the choice is 
restricted to factors relying on information available in the scenario f knowledge-poor 
processing, that is, without extensive semantic domain modeling. 
In the ROSANA system, the following factors are employed: SYR (contributed 
by occurrences with identical syntactic function), EEP (occUrrences realized in the 
syntactic position of existential emphasis), SUP (syntactic subject), PGP (possessive 
pronouns, saxonian genitives, and genitive attributes), DOP/IOP/APP (salience of 
direct/indirect objects and adverbial PPs, respectively), KAM (negative preference of 
cataphoric resumptions), SDM (sentence recency; i.e., a factor of negative salience to 
be multiplied with the sentence distance between anaphor and antecedent), WDM 
(word recency). The main part of Table 1 indicates which subset of factors is used for 
scoring the candidate set of which class of anaphoric expression (DNOM = definite 
NP, PER{I,2,3} = first/second/third person pronouns, POS{1,2,3} = first/second/third 
person possessives, RELA = relative pronouns, REFL = reflexive/reciprocal pronouns). 
The assignment of the factors and the choice of the weights (shown in the lower 
part of the table) have been determined by a series of refinement experiments on a 
training corpus of 31 news agency press releases (11,808 words, 471 pronouns) for 
which key data were provided manually. As a proper base for the goal-directed re- 
finement of the factor assignments and weights, the interpretation results were scored 
according to two of the formal evaluation disciplines that will be defined in Sec- 
tion 5, namely, determination f coreference classes (model-theoretic scoring) and non- 
pronominal anchors. 23 The factor/weight relations determined by Lappin and Leass 
(1994) for third person pronouns were taken as the initial clue. For the other types of 
anaphoric expressions, ets of weighted factors were assigned based on an analysis of 
the referential context of typical occurrences in the training corpus. For example, the 
22 This is partly due to lexical ambiguity (homonymy), or  regarding names, due to lack of the respective 
lexical information. 
23 Since, for these disciplines, two-dimensional (precision/recall) measures are defined, there may, in 
general, be multiple (pareto-)optimal factor/weight assignments. Instead, one may refer to a combined 
(weighted) scoring scheme, such as the F measure employed in the MUC evaluations.

corpus s tudy  revealed that first person nonpossessive and possessive pronouns  typi- 
cally resume discourse referents instantiated by nearby antecedents that occur in the 
syntactic subject role; consequently, the factors SUP, WDM,  and KAM were chosen. 24 
Dur ing a series of variation and evaluat ion runs in which some of the factors were 
systematical ly deactivated, these initial ass ignments were empir ical ly val idated. 25 
Finally, a series of experiments with the factor weights were carried out. Clearly, 
the absolute size of the weights is irrelevant. However ,  some condit ions that seem to 
govern the relative size of the factor weights were determined/conf i rmed dur ing the 
training runs. For example, in locally vary ing the assigned weights in such a way  that 
individual  > relations of the syntactic funct ion hierarchy SUP > DOP > IOP > APP  
were violated (e.g., by  setting SUP = 10 < DOP = 15), it was experimental ly verif ied 
that the original weight  relations yield better results. Further f indings are: SDM > 
SYR (syntactic parallel ism induces local preferences only); SYR > SUP (if an anaphor  
occurs in a syntactic role other than subject, then candidates with that same role are 
preferred to candidates in subject role); KAM large (cataphoric resumpt ions are heavi ly 
penalized). For the most  part, these results coincide with, or prov ide further support  
for, similar f indings by Lappin and Leass (1994, page 549). 26 
As table I makes evident, the salience factors proper  (determined by syntactic role) 
are employed  only in the case of pronomina l  anaphors.  Most  importantly,  there is a 
striking difference between PER3 and POS3: whereas, in the former case, a hierarchy of 
syntactic roles (i.e., salience factors with decreasing weights) is referred to, in the latter 
case, only the factors of subject preference and syntactic parallel ism are employed  
because it turned out that possessive pronouns  tend to cospecify with antecedents 
that are either syntactic subjects or, again, possessive pronouns.  Relative pronouns  are 
considered to be an exception: since, in most  cases, they take their antecedents in the 
nearest vicinity, the word  recency factor proved to be sufficient. 
24 Through this preference, cases are accounted for, too, in which appropriate third person antecedents 
occur outside a passage of quoted speech containing the first person pronoun. In particular, this 
renders possible the determination of nonpronominal anchors (cf. Section 5.3) for first person pronouns. 
25 Whereas, in large part, the experiments confirmed the factor assignments for third person pronouns 
suggested by Lappin and Leass, it turned out that the training corpus did not contain a sufficient 
number of occurrences realized in the syntactic position of existential emphasis for evaluating the 
contribution of the EEP factor. This should be addressed by further experiments on larger corpora. 
26 One divergence regards the size of the syntactic parallelism factor SYR. According to the experimental 
results, SYR should be larger than SUP. However, Lappin and Leass determined that SYR should be 
just large enough to offset the preference for subjects over accusative objects, that is, SYR + DOP > 
SUP. This issue should be addressed by further experiments.

5. Enhancing the Evaluation Methodology for Anaphor Resolution Systems 
For a proper evaluation of ROSANA, appropriate valuation measures have to be 
chosen. In the following discussion, it will be advocated that, to obtain results that 
are expressive from the developer's as well as the application's point of view, several 
evaluation disciplines hould be considered. 27
5.1 Model-Theoretic Coreference Scoring 
Vilain et al (1996) developed the model-theoretic scoring scheme according to which 
precision and recall values are computed by a formal alignment of the coreference 
equivalence classes of system output and intellectually gathered key data. Basically, 
precision errors correspond to nontrivial partitions of system-generated quivalence 
classes induced by key equivalence classes, whereas recall errors correspond to non- 
trivial partitions of key equivalence classes induced by system-generated equivalence 
classes. 
Formally, let R s and R k be the coreference relations computed by the anaphor 
resolution system and specified by the key, respectively; moreover, let \[R s\] and \[Rk\] be 
the respective sets of equivalence classes. Furthermore, with C s ~ \[R s\] and C k E IRk\], 
let C s n O k and C k N 0 s be the equivalence classes (sets of occurrences) obtained by 
restricting the original equivalence classes to the sets of occurrences & and O s over 
which the relations R k and R s, respectively, are defined; a8 analogously, let q~ (C s, R k) and 
? (C k, R ~) be the equivalence relations that result by restricting the original relations R k 
and R S to the occurrences contained in the equivalence classes C ~ E \[R s\] and C k C 
IRk\], respectively (cf. the discussion in Section 5.2.1). 29 In addition, let \[~(C k, R~)\] and 
\[q)(C ~, Rk)\] be the sets of equivalence classes of the restricted relations. The precision 
and recall measures are computed by summing over the sets of equivalence classes of 
system response and key classes, respectively. For each class C, there is a maximum of 
ICN O\] - 1 correct contributions; the actual number of errors, which equals the number 
of equivalence classes \]\[q~(C, R)\]\[ of the restricted relation minus 1, has to be deducted. 
Hence, one obtains the measures 
Pco := 
Rco :=

Csc\[R s\] 
( Id  n - I\[ (Ck, 
C k c \[R k\] 
(IC k n Osl - 1)

5.2 Scoring from the Developer's Point of View 
The above precision and recall measures refer to a formal, mathematical property of 
the structure of the results computed by coreference resolution systems, namely, the 
disjoint partitioning of the set of occurrences in equivalence classes of cospecifying 
27 See also Mitkov 2001, in which, independently, similar proposals regarding the separate valuation of 
anaphor esolution system components have been made. There are some further important 
contributions of this paper that can be regarded as complementary to the work presented below, 
particularly the definition of formal evaluation measures for determining the decision power and the 
relative importance of individual salience factors. 
28 This means thatR k CO k x O k andR s C 0 s x O s. 
29 To put it formally: ~(CS,R  k) = R k f3 (C s x C s) and 02(Ck, R s) = R s c3 (C k xCk). 
494

entities. Whereas the definitions are appealing from tile point of view of theoretical 
elegance, from the system developer's perspective they display certain shortcomings. 
5.2.1 Supporting the Optimization of Component Algorithms. A first point of crit- 
icism is the lack of expressiveness regarding the different ypical subproblems to 
be solved by coreference r solution systems. One particular subtask that is usually 
handled by a preprocessor is the identification of relevant occurrences, that is, entity- 
specifying linguistic expressions. As a suitable base for evaluating and optimizing this 
module, it seems to be adequate to dedicate separate valuation measures, the defini- 
tion of which, in this case, is straightforward: letO s and O k be the sets of occurrences 
computed/specified by the coreference r solution system/key, then set 
rO s n O k\] 
poc . -  los} 
Lo s n okl 
Roc . -  iokf 
To ensure the expressiveness of the totality of evaluation measures, it is essential that 
they be decoupled from each other in the sense that errors at one stage of processing 
are exclusively reflected in the respective valuation measure. Regarding the possible 
effects of precision and recall errors of occurrence identification on model-theoretic 
coreference scoring, this requirement is met by referring, in the definitions given in 
Section 5.1, to the restricted classes C ~ N O k and C k N O S, and to the restricted relations 
? (C s, R k) and ~(C k, RS). Without his refinement of the model-theoretic measures, there 
may be cases of scoring anomalies. If the cardinalities in the above definitions were 
determined by referring to the original (unreduced) equivalence classes and relations, 
each additional occurrence o s E Cs\O k or o k c Ck\O s would lead to an (incorrect) 
increase in precision or recall, respectively, because, trivially, these sets of occurrences 
are not partitioned by the relations R k or R s, respectively. 
5.2.2 Supporting the Refinement of Preferential Factors. As shown in Table 1, the 
set of relevant salience factors depends on the specific type of anaphoric expression. 
Hence, the evaluation measures defined so far are considered insufficient for an opti- 
mization of factor assignments and weights. From the system developer's perspective, 
there is a need for fine-grained information that distinguishes between different classes 
of anaphoric expressions. 
As will become evident during evaluation of the ROSANA system in Section 6, 
another reason for differentiating between types of anaphoric expressions i  the lack of 
expressiveness of model-theoretic scoring regarding the interpretation quality achieved 
for pronouns (i.e., for the class of anaphors that is, from the perspective of typical 
applications, of central importance). 
5.3 Scoring from an Application's Point of View: Nonpronominal Anchors 
Regarding the requirements of typical applications, g? the task of pronoun interpreta- 
tion may be defined as determining a suitable nonpronominal substitute, that is, a 
nonpronominal antecedent rather than an arbitrary cospecifying antecedent that again 
might be a pronoun. 
30 For example, the MUC information extraction task proper (Scenario Template), orthe classical 
quantitative, dictionary-based content analysis of the social sciences. 
495 
Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4 
According to model-theoretic coreference scoring, no distinction is made between 
pronominal and nonpronominal antecedents: what is relevant are the sizes of the 
matching fractions of equivalence classes rather than the presence of correct non- 
pronominal  anchors suitable as substitute xpressions. There are at least two reasons 
why the task of identifying correct nonpronominal substitutes i considerably harder 
than the task of finding an arbitrary correct antecedent. First, there is focus-theoretic 
evidence: typically, entities pecified by pronouns are in fOCUS 31 and, hence, most prob- 
ably the antecedents of subsequent pronouns, which tend to resume the currently 
focused entity. 32 Second, a technical argument applies: the cospecification relation be- 
tween a pronominal anaphor and a nonpronominal representative is algorithmically 
determined by a nonempty chain of antecedent decisions that may, in general, be long: 
Gropius ~- he , + he ~ him +,Z_ him 
Whereas the hypothetical single error (indicated by " - ' )  implies incorrect nonprono- 
minal anchors for all pronouns, according to the model-theoretic measure the precision 
amounts to 0.75. Consequently, the evaluation scheme defined so far should be sup- 
plemented by a measure that is expressive with respect o the application-relevant task 
of identifying nonpronominal nchors. 
To derive a suitable formal evaluation measure, one may start with the observation 
that the relevant linguistic entities to be resolved are pronominal occurrences P for 
which nonpronominal nchor occurrences A have to be identified. Basically, an anchor 
A shall be considered a correct substitute for P if and only if A and P belong to the 
same equivalence class of the key coreference relation. From a theoretical point of 
view, this definition must be considered simplistic given the well-known examples of 
opaque (intensional) contexts in which the substitution of coreferring expressions i not 
a truth-preserving operation. These cases, however, are rare and do not seem to play 
a role in typical application scenarios of pronoun interpretation algorithms, asHence, 
the simple definition will be employed, which, in addition, entails the advantage that 
the key data provided for model-theoretic coreference scoring suffices for the scoring 
of nonpronominal substitutes. 
Let (P,A) be a pair consisting of a pronominal occurrence P and the anchor oc- 
currence A determined by the anaphor esolution system. (If, for P, no substitute has 
been determined, then A is considered empty.) A suitable base for scoring is obtained 
by classifying the pairs (P, A) according to the scheme described in Table 2, by which 
a total of seven pairwise disjoint sets is defined. The classification depends on (1) 
whether P and/or  A are tagged, in the key, as valid (entity-specifying) occurrences, 
(2) whether A is nonempty, and (3) whether, in case A is nonempty and both A and 
L are valid occurrences, A and L cospecify in the key. According to the above defini- 
tion, only the pairs fulfilling condition (3) (which, hence, constitute the set 0++) are 
considered to be correct solutions. 
31 Care should be taken not to confound two different notions of focus here. In terms of the classical 
topic-focus distinction, one would say that pronouns tend to specifiy entities constituting the topic. 
32 Compare, for example, the predictions of the centering theory (Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein 1995). 
33 There is another argument that supports the choice of the simple definition. Probably the best 
algorithmic strategy for determining correct anchors is the selection of the first nonpronominal 
cospecifying occurrence that topologically precedes the pronoun to be resolved (cf. the above decision 
chain argument). If,however, the distance between the determined substitute and the pronoun is small, 
from the point of view of conversational pragmatics it is implausible that the intension of the 
substitute occurrence does not match the (possibly opaque) context, since, otherwise, human readers 
are expected to be misled as well (Stuckardt 2000, page 240).

stage of evaluat ion,  and,  moreover ,  it is assumed that there are no errors regard ing  
the classif icat ion of occurrences as dec is ion- re levant  entit ies (i.e., pronouns), 3s it fo l lows

to h igher  recal l  and lower  precis ion.  The special  case P = R ho lds  if the set 0+_ is 
empty,  that  is, if there are no open decis ions.  36 
34 In generalizing the handling of optional coreferences (as originally specified in the coreference task 
definition \[Hirschman 1998\] with respect to model-theoretic scoring), unresolved pronouns whose 
antecedent link is marked as optional in the key (i.e., the elements of the set 0+,) are not taken into 
account in the recall measure of the nonpronominal nchor discipline. 
35 The latter simplification is unproblernatic because, under the condition that an expression is a valid 
occurrence, the decision whether it represents a pronoun is trivial. 
36 The one-dimensional accuracy measure that is typically employed in the evaluation of pronoun 
resolution algorithms (for example, Lappin and Leass \[1994\] orKennedy and Boguraev \[1996\]) 
implicitly relies on the fact that all pronouns are resolved. Under this condition, distinguishing between 
precision and recall becomes unnecessary. Hence, the definition of the two-dimensional measure 
(Pna, Rna) must be considered a generalization f the conventional ccuracy measure. Employing the 
refined precision/recall distinction even in the case of the arbitrary antecedent discipline may be 
appropriate when evaluating anaphor resolution systems that aim at achieving high precision by 
leaving some of the decisions open.

6. Evaluation of the ROSANA System 
Figure 5 shows the evaluation results of the ROSANA system on a corpus of 35 news 
agency press releases, comprising 12,904 words and 479 pronouns. 37 The evaluation, 
which was performed according to the enhanced set of evaluation measures, took 
place under application conditions, that is, without an a priori manual correction of 
orthographic or syntactic errors. 
6.1 Entity-Specifying Occurrences 
The upper part of Figure 5 displays the score on the discipline of identifying entity- 
specifying occurrences (cf. Section 5.2.1): this subproblem is solved by ROSANA with 
a (Poc, Roe) performance of (0.94,0.96). Regarding the precision errors, a closer look re- 
veals that approximately 50% of the 243 overgenerated occurrences can immediately 
be traced back to errors during morphological and syntactic analysis (in particular, 
there were a number of cases in which adjectives were wrongly classified as nouns, 
or in which the parsing of a compound NP failed); another 40% are failures of the 
ROSANA occurrence identification algorithm proper. Regarding recall, fewer than 20% 
of the missing 150 occurrences are due to errors of the ROSANA occurrence identifi- 
cation algorithm. 
With respect o the identification of pronouns, the performance of (0.94,0.996) is 
considerably higher. In this important case, precision errors that were caused by mis- 
categorization of nonreferential occurrences of the expressions it and that are the main 
problem. An improvement of approximately 50% may be gained by refining the syn- 
tactic analysis, which, at present, fails in certain cases (e.g.) to recognize nonreferential 
occurrences of it as formal subjects. 
6.2 Coreference Classes and Immediate Antecedents 
According to the model-theoretic coreference scoring scheme defined in Section 5.1, 
the (P~o,Rco) performance of ROSANA is (0.81,0.68) (Figure 5, coreference classes). 
A closer analysis of the correctness of the immediate antecedents makes evident hat 
the actual interpretation quality varies heavily with respect o the type of anaphoric 
expression. 3s Whereas the precision regarding the antecedent choices for names 
amounts to 0.94, the performance for the important classes of third person pronouns 
and possessives i considerably lower (0.71 and 0.76, respectively). 39 Furthermore, as 
expected, the precision for reflexive/reciprocal pronouns is optimal (1.0) since binding 
principle A yields tight syntactic bounds that delimit the space of possible antecedents. 
Regarding definite NPs, the interpretation quality is considerably lower (0.7) because, 
at present, ROSANA relies on a simple test for lexical recurrence and number agree- 
ment and does not employ enhanced techniques for the interpretation of nonpronom- 
inal anaphora. 4?Finally, the precision for first and second person pronouns is quite 
37 A scoring module has been implemented by which the above-defined valuation measures are 
computed. Reference data have been provided by an intellectual nnotation ofthe press release corpus 
according to the MUC-7 coreference task definition (Hirschman 1998). 
38 Regarding the anaphor type abbreviations employed in Figure 5, see Section 4.5. 
39 The figures regarding the correctness of immediate arbitrary antecedents have been determined 
according to the precision measure that was originally developed for scoring nonpronominal anchors. 
Since, at least for the most common types of third person pronouns (PER3, POS3), immediate 
antecedents are determined invirtually any case, the recall figures are almost identical (cf. the 
discussion i  Section 5.3). The precision measure coincides with the accuracy measure mployed by, for 
example, Lappin and Leass (1994) or Kennedy and Boguraev (1996). 
40 The results in Figure 5 also indicate that a huge fraction of definite NP occurrences (1,973 + 43) are not 
assigned an antecedent. This figure, which at first sight seems to be too high, is of the right order of

high, too (0.95 and 1.0 for nonpossessives and possessives, respectively), mainly due 
to the person congruence condition. Regarding pronouns, a closer analysis hows that 
approximately 30% of precision errors are due to the assignment of incorrect gender 
attributes during morphological analysis and occurrence identification, and, hence, 
may be eliminated if additional lexical information becomes available. Another 30% 
of errors are induced by cases that are beyond the horizon of the heuristic salience- 
based antecedent ranking in the sense that a theoretically adequate solution would 
rely on background knowledge that usually is unavailable in unrestricted application 
contexts. 
On one hand, the discussion reveals that refinements should focus on third person 
pronouns and definite NPs. On the other hand, the results also indicate that, on the 
basis of the information usually available in knowledge-poor environments, there is 
little room for further improvement. 41 
6.3 Nonpronominal Anchors 
Regarding the task of identifying nonpronominal nchors, the results fall considerably 
below the figures determined above for the immediate (arbitrary) antecedent case. 
According to the (Pna, R~a) measures defined in Section 5.3, the average precision is 
reduced to 0.70 (compared with 0.76); regarding third person pronouns and posses- 
sives, the precision decreases to 0.68 (0.71) and 0.66 (0.76), respectively. 
The striking difference with the results of model-theoretic and immediate (arbi- 
trary) antecedent scoring confirms the arguments put forward in Section 5.3 according 
to which the determination ofnonpronominal nchors is considerably harder: whereas, 
for 306 pronouns, correct immediate (arbitrary) antecedents as well as nonpronomi- 
nal anchors were determined, there are another 21 cases in which only the former 
choice proved to be correct (cf. the chain argument). Furthermore, the focus-theoretic 
argument is supported: out of the selected antecedents of type pronoun, 85.6% were 
correct, whereas, out of the selected antecedents of type definite NP/name, only 71.3% 
were correct. Hence, as a proper base for obtaining results that are expressive with re- 
spect o the pronoun substitution task, the model-theoretic coreference scoring scheme 
should be supplemented with the described additional measures. 
6.4 Toward a Genre-Specific Assignment of Preference Factors 
Since the assignment of the salience factors and their weights has been heuristically 
optimized on a training corpus of news agency press releases (cf. Section 4.5), the 
question arises whether, on one hand, these settings are still optimal on the evaluation 
set of press releases, and, on the other hand, they are optimal on other corpora drawn 
from different genres and domains as well. Five experiments were conducted to ad- 
dress these topics. The second evaluation corpus consisted of three texts describing the 
plots of Mozart operas. These texts, which comprise 2,522 words and 236 pronouns, 
were considered suitable since they differ considerably from the press releases in text 
genre, domain, and formal characteristics (e.g., the higher density of pronouns). 
The five experiments that were conducted are: (1) deactivated syntactic paral- 
lelism, (2) deactivated syntactic subject salience A deactivated syntactic role hierarchy 
magnitude since, in the key of the press release corpus, around 2,300 coreference lasses are specified, 
the first textual mention of which is typically accomplished by a common oun or name. 
41 Regarding the coreference lass task, one must keep in mind that even the interannotator agreement 
that was measured uring key construction i MUC-6 amounts only to 81%. Clearly, human 
performance with respect to the annotation of reference corpora, which, to a large extent, depends on 
the complexity of the task definition, imposes an upper bound on the system performance that is, in 
principle, measurable.

(cf. Section 4.5). The results are shown in Table 3, where rows correspond to the differ- 
ent experiments and co lumns  42 represent the most important evaluation measures. 43
First, the table reveals that, with respect o the system's performance in interpret- 
ing pronominal naphora, the model-theoretic s oring scheme must be regarded as an 
unsuitable indicator since the sensitivity with respect to the salience strategy variations 
is too low. Second, the results on the evaluation set of the press release corpus confirm 
the original assignment of salience factors and weights. Moreover, some interesting 
observations concerning the relative contributions of the factors can be made. The 
algorithmically trivial preference criterion of sentence recency proved to be the most 
valuable factor (Experiment (4)). 44 In the case of the press release corpus and regarding 
the PER3 measure, a relation of mutual substitution seems to hold between the factors 
of syntactic parallelism and subject salience/syntactic role hierarchy: whereas deacti- 
vation of either strategy results in a moderate performance r duction (Experiments (1) 
and (2), respectively), deactivation of both strategies induces considerable deterioration 
(Experiment (3)). These findings are in line with the results of Lappin and Leass (1994), 
who made similar observations in their factor variation experiments, but conjectured 
on a more abstract level that a relationship of complex interdependency holds between 
the different syntactic salience factors. 4s In providing evidence for a relation of mutual 
42 In the columns labeled PER3 and POS3, the results in the immediate (arbitrary) antecedent discipline 
are shown. 
43 The results of the original version of ROSANA on the Mozart operas corpus are: (Poe, Roe) = (0.95,0.98), 
(Peo, Rco) = (0.88,0.81), (Pna, Rna) = (0.75,0.74); nonpronominal  nchors for pronouns of type 
PER3/POS3 are determined with a precision of 0.70/0,76. Hence, performance is even better than on 
the press release corpus, a result that may be partly explained by the higher proportion of pronouns 
and names,  which, as observed above, are resolvable with higher precision than definite NPs. 
44 This result coincides with similar f indings by numerous  other researchers, for example, Lappin and 
Leass (1994, page 551). 
45 Lappin and Leass took into account four groups of "structural" salience factors: parallelism, 
501 
Computational Linguistics Volume 27, Number 4 
substitution between two important classes of syntactic preference factors, the above 
results allow for a more precise rendering of this statement. 
Closer investigation of the results on the Mozart operas corpus reveals that the 
factor assignment only partly generalizes. The result deterioration i duced by deac- 
tivation of sentence recency (Experiment (4)) is even larger, a finding that may be 
explained by a characteristic property of the cohesion structure of opera plot texts, 
namely, the rapid shifts of the local foci from scene to scene, which contrasts harply 
with the typically steady focus in the press release texts. If the sentence recency factor is 
switched off, this implies that the remaining focus-approximating salience factors (syn- 
tactic parallelism, subject salience, hierarchy of syntactic function) may lead to wrong 
decisions ince the local foci of past scenes, which in the meantime have moved out 
of focus, would receive the same salience. 
A similar observation of cohesion structure dependency may be made regarding 
syntactic parallelism in the POS3 strategy. Whereas, with respect o the press release 
corpus, the positive contribution of this factor is confirmed, for the Mozart opera 
texts, a negative contribution was measured: the deactivation i Experiment (1) yields 
a gain of 3%. Closer analysis of the documents reveals that local contexts contributing 
multiple POS3 occurrences with different reference are typical for this text genre: 
(9) On a dark night in Seville, Leporello is keeping watch, grumbling, 
outside a house in which his master Don Giovanni is engaged in his 
latest amorous pursuit. 
Again, the findings of the factor assignment experiments permit elaboration on a 
conjecture by Lappin and Leass (1994, page 552), according to which considerable 
improvement should be achieved by employing, for an optimization of the factor 
assignments, tatistical analyses of patterns of pronominal anaphora in corpora. More 
precisely, the above results indicate that the text genre is reflected in some formal 
properties of the cohesion structure that are important clues for the choice of factors. 
In other words, the experiments indicate that salience factors and weights should be 
assigned in a genre-specific way.  46 F rom a practical point of view, these results are 
highly relevant since, meanwhile, various referentially annotated corpora of different 
genres (particularly the key data provided in formal evaluations) have been made 
available. 
7. Comparison and Conclusion 
In the previous ections, a robust approach to anaphor interpretation has been devel- 
oped that follows the deficient description model. Based on a set of disjoint reference 
rule patterns for fragmentary syntax, the ROSANA system accomplishes coreference 
resolution with high precision and recall in various evaluation disciplines. The eval- 
uation was carried out according to an enhanced set of scoring measures that sheds 
light on aspects of development as well as application. The different arguments put 
forward for an enhancement of the evaluation methodology for coreference r solution 
systems have been confirmed. In particular, the evaluation results have proven the 
nonadverbial/matrix and head emphasis, hierarchy of syntactic roles, and cataphora penalty. Whereas, 
during individual deactivation of these factors, they observed comparatively small deteriorations of
less than 4%, the combined eactivation led to a reduction of more than 25% (Lappin and Leass 1994, 
page 552). 
46 In searching for additional evidence, further tests on corpora of other text genres hould be carried out. 
502

lack of sensitivity of the original model-theoretic coreference scoring scheme with re- 
spect o salience strategy variation as well as pronoun interpretation quality. Moreover, 
the figures confirm that, regarding pronouns, determining nonpronominal nchors is 
more difficult than computing arbitrary cospecifying antecedents: on average, results 
in the former discipline are 5.5% (press releases)/5% (Mozart operas corpus) below 
the results in the latter discipline. 
As a proper basis for comparing ROSANA with the approaches of Lappin and 
Leass (1994) and Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), one must focus on the evaluation re- 
sults for third person pronouns in the immediate (arbitrary) antecedent discipline (as 
discussed in Section 6.2). For third person pronouns (comprising nonpossessives, pos- 
sessives, reflexives/reciprocals, and relative pronouns), ROSANA determined cospeci- 
185 fying antecedents with a precision of 4~922 = 0.75 (press releases) and 2~ = 0.79 (Mozart 
operas corpus). At first sight, the gap between these figures and the precision of 0.86 
that was determined for the (nonrobust) approach of Lappin and Leass is still con- 
siderable, a difference that may be partly attributed to the more difficult conditions 
of robust processing, and partly to the (presumably well-behaved) characteristics of
the text corpus employed by Lappin and Leass (computer manuals). The standard of 
comparison, however, is the robust approach of Kennedy and Boguraev, which follows 
the shallow description model and which achieves an average precision of 0.75 on a 
broad set of texts taken from different genres and domains. In the case of ROSANA, a 
precision of 0.75 is achieved on the corpus of press releases, which exhibits the typical 
properties of mass texts (e.g., a comparatively high rate of orthographic and syntac- 
tic errors) and, hence, presumably imposes high demands on robust processing. On 
the Mozart operas corpus, which, in this sense, is easier, the scores are considerably 
higher. However, since different evaluation corpora have been used, and, moreover, 
since the precision figure mentioned in the results of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) is 
not qualified with respect o text genre, a direct comparison of the empirical results 
should be based on further investigations. 47 
As an alternative way of comparing the two approaches, their performance with 
respect o the robust algorithmization of anaphor esolution strategies that rely on syn- 
tactic evidence (in particular, syntactic disjoint reference) may be evaluated in detail. 
Regarding the scope of robust processing of ROSANA according to the deficient de- 
scription model, a qualification of the typical failures gives evidence that, with respect 
to the fragmentary descriptions generated by the chosen parser, the robust imple- 
mentation of syntactic disjoint reference is nearly optimal. None of the 7 incorrect 
antecedent choices that are due to failures of the disjoint reference strategy (out of a 
total of 246 wrong antecedent choices for the evaluation corpus of press releases) are 
due to wrong predictions of the (still partly heuristic) algorithmization of the binding- 
theoretic restrictions; rather, they are caused by wrong (in contrast o fragmentary, 
i.e., partial) parsing results: while already employing defensive parsing strategies, the 
parser still overgenerates in certain cases. In 6 of the 7 disjoint reference failures, a con- 
figurationally admissible candidate has been erroneously eliminated; in the remaining 
case, a configurationally forbidden candidate has been erroneously approved. Hence, 
there is a tendency toward overgenerating disjoint reference restrictions. A detailed 
47 This might be achieved either by employing the corpus used by Kennedy and Boguraev, which was 
not available at the time ROSANA was evaluated, or by running Kennedy and Boguraev's algorithm (a 
reimplementation f which requires, in particular, a formal description of the regular filter employed 
by Kennedy and Boguraev to partially infer constituency) on the news agency press releases and 
Mozart operas corpora.

analysis reveals that, in 4 of the 6 cases, the respective parsing error consists in a 
wrong interpretation of a structurally ambiguous relative clause. This gives evidence 
that, while the rate of disjoint reference failure is already very low (2.8% of all failures), 
a slight improvement may be achieved by employing a more defensive parsing strat- 
egy with a slightly higher level of syntactic fragmentation, which, by now, amounts 
to an average of 2.61 fragments per sentence. 48
These findings may be compared with the results of Kennedy and Boguraev (1996), 
which report 2 cases of pronoun misinterpretation (out of a total of 75 failures) that 
are due to a failure to establish configurationally determined isjoint reference, and 
several additional cases in which a wrong antecedent was chosen because of a wrong 
heuristic assignment of syntactic salience factors. Hence, with respect o syntactic dis- 
joint reference, the failure rate of the shallow description approach (2.7% of all failures) 
of Kennedy and Boguraev is of the same order of magnitude as that of the deficient de- 
scription approach followed by ROSANA (2.8%). As the above analysis has revealed, 
however, in the case of ROSANA, the disjoint reference rrors are not induced by 
failures of the heuristic algorithmization of the disjoint reference conditions; instead, 
they can be traced back to wrong decisions made during parsing, thus leaving some 
room for improvement by fine-tuning the rule pattern set and parsing strategy. This 
opens up the possibility of a further refinement, which is the immediate consequence 
of the conceptually transparent way of implementing robust disjoint reference by fol- 
lowing the deficient description model. Regarding the syntactic preference strategies, 
ROSANA scores well, too: only 3 wrong antecedent decisions (1.2% of all failures) are 
due to errors in the assignment of syntactic salience factors. 
Since the difference in interpretation quality can be expected to be small, the de- 
cision whether to follow the shallow description approach or the deficient description 
approach may be based on practical considerations. Whereas the former approach 
imposes lesser demands on preprocessing resources and implementation, the latter 
approach may yield slightly better results. If one considers implementation and fine- 
tuning of the deficient description algorithm relative to a particular parser as a once- 
and-for-all effort, and, moreover, takes into account the further benefits of having 
partial syntactic analyses available during anaphor esolution, 49the deficient descrip- 
tion approach may be the method of choice for robust anaphor esolution. Depending 
on the parser that is used and the characteristics of the texts to be interpreted, which, 
in large part, determine number and type of failures of robust syntactic disjoint ref- 
erence, it may, in certain cases, be reasonable to apply a hybrid strategy that aims at 
avoiding, as far as possible, heuristic decisions: if the syntactic analysis yields suf- 
ficient evidence, deficient descriptions are employed; otherwise, shallow description 
rules are used. s? 
48 As emphasized in Section 3.3, since, in general, the choice of rule patterns for robust disjoint reference 
should depend on the parser that is used, an increase in the degree of parse fragmentation may give 
rise to extending the set of patterns. The general question of optimizing the choice of rule patterns, 
relative to a given parser, is an important issue that deserves further attention. 
49 For example, Kennedy and Boguraev (1996) mention the problem of interpreting quoted speech 
separately from its surrounding context, acomplex problem whose solution should be facilitated if 
richer syntactic nformation isavailable. In fact, ROSANA already employs everal successful heuristics 
for interpreting anaphors in quoted speech, such as the handling of first person pronouns that occur in 
the subject position of a quoted sentence. 
50 Since the number of disjoint reference failures is already low, the potential benefits of employing a
hybrid strategy are limited. Whether there may be an additional contribution depends heavily on the 
degree to which the two strategies ofrobust syntactic disjoint reference differ with respect to their 
failure cases, which should thus be analyzed by an in-depth evaluation on large corpora.

Stuckardt A Robust Anaphor Resolution Algorithm 
Whereas the robust algorithmization of syntactic disjoint reference has thus been 
achieved in a nearly optimal way, with respect o the overall set of anaphor esolution 
strategies, there is considerably more room for improvement. Regarding the impor- 
tant case of pronoun interpretation, asdetermined in Section 6.2, more than 30% of the 
failures are due to the assignment of incorrect gender attributes, and another 30% are 
induced by cases that are beyond the horizon of the heuristic antecedent preference 
strategies. Under the conditions of robust, operational processing, whereas the former 
problem may be solved by a once-and-for-all improvement of the lexical resources, the 
latter case remains difficult since, in general, background knowledge will be needed. 
According to the results of the formal evaluation, at least a partial, genre-specific re- 
f inement of the preference strategies may be achieved in a manner compatible with the 
conditions of robust processing. While a more systematic investigation and evaluation 
of the latter issue is pending, the above results give rise to the expectation that, by 
exploiting the potential for further improvements, robust approaches to anaphor eso- 
lution should be able to achieve a precision of 0.8 (arbitrary antecedent discipline) and 
0.75 (nonpronominal nchor discipline) even on difficult text genres like press releases.
