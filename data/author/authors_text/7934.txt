Abstract
This paper describes two new features of
the BRIDJE system for cross-language
information access. The first feature is
the partial disambiguation function of
the Bi-directional Retriever, which can
be used for search request translation in
cross-language IR. Its advantage over a
?black-box? machine translation approach
is consistent across five test collections
and across two language permutations:
English-Japanese and Japanese-English.
The second new feature is the Information
Distiller, which performs interactive
summarisation of retrieved documents
based on Semantic Role Analysis. Our
examples illustrate the usefulness of
this feature, and our evaluation results
show that the precision of Semantic Role
Analysis is very high.
1 Introduction
Cross-Language Information Retrieval
(CLIR) (Grefenstette, 1998) has received a lot
of attention recently. TREC currently studies
English-Arabic IR, CLEF studies CLIR across
European languages, and NTCIR studies CLIR
across Asian languages (Chen et al, 2003; Kando,
2001). As with monolingual IR, CLIR evaluations
usually rely on the use of static test collections: The
system accepts a source language search request and
outputs a ranked list of target language documents,
and this list is evaluated using metrics such as
Average Precision. However, CLIR solves only part
of the Language Barrier Problem: if the user cannot
express his information need in target language,
then he probably cannot make much use of the
retrieved documents written in the same language.
(If the source and target languages are reasonably
similar, then the user may find such plain CLIR
useful. However, this is certainly not the case for
pairs of disparate languages such as English and
Japanese.) Thus, what deserves more attention is
Cross-Language Information Access (CLIA), which
subsumes CLIR and provides useful information to
the user in source language (e.g. (Frederking et al,
1997)).
This paper describes two new features of the
BRIDJE (Bi-directional Retriever/Information Dis-
tiller for Japanese and English) system (Sakai et al,
2002a; Sakai et al, 2002b; Sakai et al, 2003) which
integrates machine translation (MT) with informa-
tion retrieval (IR) to support both English-Japanese
(E-J) and Japanese-English (J-E) CLIA. The first fea-
ture is the partial disambiguation function of the Bi-
directional Retriever part of BRIDJE for enhancing
retrieval performance in the traditional sense. While
most of the traditional MT-based CLIR systems use
MT as a ?black box?, partial disambiguation accesses
the internal data structures of a commercial MT sys-
tem for search request translation so that multiple
translation candidates can be used as search terms.
We present positive results that are consistent across
five test collections (or six topic sets), and across
two language permutations: English-Japanese and
Japanese-English. To our knowledge, BRIDJE is
the first system that truly integrates MT with IR and
performs well in terms of standard measures. The
second new feature is the entire Information Dis-
tiller part of BRIDJE, which can provide generic
or query-specific summaries of the retrieved docu-
ments, as well as their translations in source lan-
guage. Based on Semantic Role Analysis (SRA)
originally designed for enhancing retrieval perfor-
mance (Sakai et al, 2002a; Suzuki et al, 2001),
the Information Distiller extracts important text frag-
ments from a retrieved document on the fly. Prelim-
inary evaluations suggest that SRA can classify text
fragments with very high precision, and that it is
useful for efficient information access. We regard
our Information Distiller feature as one step towards
Cross-Language Question Answering.
BRIDJE is an enhanced, fully bilingual version
of the KIDS Japanese retrieval system that recently
achieved the highest performances in the English-
Japanese and Japanese monolingual IR tasks at
NTCIR-3 (Chen et al, 2003; Sakai et al, 2003).
The remainder of this paper is organised as fol-
lows: Section 2 compares some of the previous work
on CLIR/CLIA with our present study. Section 3
provides an overview of the BRIDJE system. Sec-
tion 4 describes an extensive set of retrieval experi-
ments that compares partial disambiguation with the
black-box MT approach. Section 5 provides exam-
ples to illustrate the advantages of the Information
Distiller for efficient information access, as well as
some evaluation results of SRA. Finally, Section 6
provides conclusions.
2 Previous Work
This section reviews some previous work on
CLIR/CLIA, focussing primarily on those that deal
with English and Japanese or those that use MT in
some way or other.
The early J-E CLIR systems (Susaki et al, 1996;
Yamabana et al, 1998) employed dictionary-based
search request translation, with corpus-based dis-
ambiguation. However, it is not clear how effective
these systems are in terms of retrieval performance.
In contrast, for both J-E and E-J CLIR, MT-based
search request translation has been combined suc-
cessfully with Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (Sakai et
al., 1999a; Sakai, 2001). The recent CLIR results
at NTCIR-3 also showed that this approach, which
BRIDJE also employs, is very promising (Chen et
al., 2003; Sakai et al, 2003).
In our partial disambiguation experiments, we
go beyond the use of MT as a black box by ac-
cessing the internal data structures of a commer-
cial MT system in order to use multiple transla-
tion candidates as search terms. Jones et al (Jones
et al, 1999) have explored this approach to some
extent, but they observed performance degradation
when compared to full disambiguation (i.e. black-
box MT), as they treated the multiple candidates as
distinct search terms. In contrast, BRIDJE treats
these candidates as a group of synonyms, which is
now known to be effective in CLIR (Pirkola, 1998).
Thus, while dictionary-based approaches start from
the maximum ambiguity state and performs vigorous
disambiguation, we start from the minimum ambi-
guity state reached through full MT and take a step
backward for obtaining alternative translations. The
SYSTRAN NLP browser (Gachot et al, 1998) also
integrates MT with IR at a deep level, but this was
designed for retrieving sentences that match specific
grammatical features, and its effectiveness as a doc-
ument retrieval system is not clear.
Regarding CLIA (as opposed to CLIR), Frederk-
ing et al (Frederking et al, 1997) proposed a frame-
work in which retrieved documents could be sum-
marised and translated by multiple MT engines in
parallel. MULINEX (Capstick et al, 2000), which
is a dictionary-based CLIR system for French, En-
glish and German, uses the LOGOS MT system for
document/summary presentation. Oard and Ren-
sik (Oard and Resnik, 1999) have used word-by-word
J-E translations in their study on interactive docu-
ment selection. PRIME (Higuchi et al, 2001), yet
another J-E/E-J CLIR system based on dictionaries
and corpora, translates retrieved patent documents
phrase-by-phrase. Compared to these CLIA sys-
tems, the Information Distiller part of BRIDJE is
unique in that it performs SRA for interactive docu-
ment summarisation/presentation.
3 The BRIDJE System
This section describes the general features of the
BRIDJE system. Sections 3.1 and 3.2 describe
the request translation and indexing/retrieval compo-
nents of the Bi-directional Retriever. Section 3.3 in-
troduces the Information Distiller that provides sum-
maries and translations of retrieved documents.
3.1 Request Translation
The default search request translation strategy of
BRIDJE is full disambiguation: a source language
request is fed to a commercial MT system (Amano et
al., 1989), and the output is treated as a monolingual
request written in target language. BRIDJE is also
capable of performing transliteration for treating
words that are outside of the MT dictionary (Sakai et
al., 2002b), but this feature is not used in the present
study.
In order to describe partial disambiguation, we
first illustrate the disambiguation process of MT with
an example. Suppose that a search request contains
the word ?play? in the context of E-J CLIR. Firstly,
by dictionary lookup, we recognise that ?play? can
either be a noun or a verb, and obtain all possi-
ble Japanese translations accordingly. Secondly, we
determine its part-of-speech through syntactic anal-
ysis. Here, suppose that ?play? was used as a verb,
and that all Japanese translations for the noun ?play?
have been filtered out. Thirdly, we perform semantic
analysis using transfer rules. These rules contain
knowledge such as ?IF the object of the verb ?play?
is a sport, THEN it should be translated as ?suru?. IF
the object is a musical instrument, THEN it should
be translated as ?hiku? or ?enso?-suru?. Here, sup-
pose that the object was ?violin?, and therefore that
?hiku? and ?enso?-suru? have been selected as transla-
tion candidates. Then, at the final output stage, only
one translation is selected for each source language
word. For the word ?play? in the above example,
?hiku? is selected as the final translation since this
is the first entry in the aforementioned transfer rule.
(The above explanation is a simplified version of
what really goes on inside our MT system.)
Partial disambiguation takes all candidate trans-
lations that are left just after the semantic analysis
stage (?hiku? and ?enso?-suru? in the above example),
and treats them as a set of synonyms in retrieval. As
it is well known, disambiguation in MT is far from
perfect, and the synonym groups thus produced often
contain some inappropriate terms. Despite this, our
experiments described in Section 4 show that partial
disambiguation is effective.
3.2 Indexing and Retrieval
Our default retrieval strategy is Okapi/BM25 with
Pseudo-Relevance Feedback (PRF) (Robertson and
Sparck Jones, 1997; Sakai, 2001). The term selec-
tion criterion used in all of our experiments involving
PRF is ow , which incorporates the initial document
scores into the traditional offer weight (Sakai et al,
2003).
BRIDJE employs word-based indexing, prior to
which synonyms and phrases can be defined. Syn-
onym groups can also be defined at query time, which
is useful for partial disambiguation and translitera-
tion (Sakai et al, 2002b): the term frequency (tf )
and the document frequency (df ) are counted as if all
the members of a synonym group are one identical
term.
Optionally, BRIDJE can perform indexing and re-
trieval based on SRA (Sakai et al, 2002a; Suzuki
et al, 2001), which was originally designed for go-
ing beyond the ?bag-of-words? approach to IR. Al-
though the present study uses SRA for interactive
document summarisation/presentation and not for re-
trieval, it works as follows: During document index-
ing and search request processing, BRIDJE can ex-
amine the output of the parser (morphological anal-
yser for Japanese; part-of-speech tagger/stemmer for
English), based on a set of hand-written SRA rules
which specify the following:
 How to break up the text into fragments, based
on regular expression pattern matching. A frag-
ment can be a sentence, a paragraph, a prepo-
sitional phrase, and so on. For example, an
English sentence of the form ?A for B with C?
can be broken into ?A?, ?for B? and ?with C? if
prepositions are used as fragment boundaries.
 How to assign Semantic Roles (SRs) to each
fragment, again based on regular expression
pattern matching. Using prepositions as SRA
triggers in the above example, it is possible
to tag the fragment ?for B? with ?PURPOSE?,
the fragment ?with C? with ?MEANS?, and the
fragment ?A? with ?UNDETERMINED? (which
means that no SRA rule matched).
 The SR correlation weights for document score
calculation in retrieval (not used for document
presentation). For example, if a term occurs in
a PURPOSE context in the request and occurs
in a PURPOSE context in the document as well,
its BM25 term weight can be upweighted.
The above simple example of using PURPOSE
and MEANS as SRs has been shown to be effec-
tive for retrieving highly relevant documents from
the NTCIR-2 English test collection (Sakai et al,
2002a). However, we have also found that it is dif-
ficult to devise SRA rules that work across different
relevance levels or across different document types.
This lead us to explore an alternative way of utilising
SRA, i.e. for document summarisation/presentation.
3.3 Information Distiller
The Information Distiller can interactively gener-
ate generic or query-specific summaries of a re-
trieved document by extracting fragments (usually
sentences) that meet specified criteria. The unique
feature of BRIDJE as a CLIA system is that it
supports interactive selection of fragments based
on SRA: For example, the user can select frag-
ments whose SRs are TOPIC/AIM, BACKGROUND,
RESULT/CONCLUSION, OPINION, and so on. In
addition, the Information Distiller can generate lead
and tf -idf -based extracts, and these criteria can be
combined with SRA requirements. The summaries
thus produced (or the original document text) can be
translated back into source language using MT.
4 Evaluation of Partial Disambiguation
This section compares partial disambiguation with
traditional full disambiguation for search request
translation in CLIR.
4.1 Experimental Setting
We used three English-Japanese test collections:
NTCIR-3 E-J (Chen et al, 2003), NTCIR-2 E-
J (Kando, 2001) and BMIR-J2 E-J (Sakai et al,
1999a; Sakai et al, 1999b) 1. As BMIR-J2 E-J
has two English topic sets X and Y translated from
a single Japanese topic set (Sakai et al, 1999a), we
1Data in BMIR-J2 is taken from the Mainichi Shimbun CD-
ROM 1994 data collection. BMIR-J2 was constructed by the
SIG Database Systems of the Information Processing Society of
Japan, in collaboration with the Real World Computing Partner-
ship.
performed four sets of E-J CLIR experiments in total.
On the other hand, we used two Japanese-English
test collections: NTCIR-3 J-E (Chen et al, 2003)
and NTCIR-2 J-E (Kando, 2001). Table 1 sum-
marises the features of these five test collections.
As they provide multiple relevance levels, the num-
ber of relevant documents summed across topics are
shown for each relevance level: S-relevant (highly
relevant), A-relevant (relevant), and B-relevant (par-
tially relevant). There are no S-relevant documents
for BMIR-J2.
Following the practice at NTCIR, we computed
Mean Average Precision (MAP) based on ?relaxed?
relevance (which treats S,A and B-relevant docu-
ments as relevant) and on ?rigid? relevance (which
treats S and A-relevant documents as relevant) (Chen
et al, 2003; Kando, 2001). In addition, for unified
evaluation with multiple relevance levels, we used
Average Gain Ratio (AGR) (Sakai et al, 2003; Sakai,
2003). For testing statistical significance, we used
the sign test.
For each test collection, full disambiguation and
partial disambiguation queries were generated us-
ing the topic descriptions. Although our MT system
has several domain-specific dictionaries, we used the
general dictionary only. For the NTCIR-3 E-J exper-
iment, the BM25 and PRF parameters were tuned
using the dryrun topics (Sakai et al, 2003). For all
other experiments, Okapi/BM25 defaults were used,
and the number of pseudo-relevant documents and
that of expansion terms were fixed to 10 and 30,
respectively (Sakai, 2001).
4.2 Results
Table 2 summarises the results of our CLIR exper-
iments. Full disambiguation runs with and without
PRF are denoted by FD+PRF and FD, while the cor-
responding partial disambiguation runs are denoted
by PD+PRF and PD, respectively. The monolin-
gual performances with and without PRF, denoted
by ML+PRF and ML, are also shown. Columns (i),
(ii) and (iii) show performances in MAP with relaxed
relevance, MAP with rigid relevance, and Mean
AGR (MAGR), respectively. Runs that significantly
outperform FD are indicated by ??s, while those
that significantly outperform PD are indicated by
?y?s. For example, Table 2A Column (i) include
the following information in terms of relaxed MAP:

(a) PD+PRF is 8% better than FD+PRF, and signifi-
cantly better than FD (  ) and PD (  );
(b) FD+PRF is not significantly better than FD and
PD (hence the lack of ??s and ?y?s); and (c) PD is
6% better than FD, but this difference is not statisti-
cally significant (hence the lack of ??s).
The following are general observations made from
Table 2:
 PD outperforms FD for all test collections in
terms of all three evaluation measures. The
improvements are 1-11%. The differences are
statistically significant in Table 2C Columns (i)
and (iii), for Topic Set Y (  ).
 PD+PRF outperforms FD+PRF for all test col-
lections in terms of all three evaluation mea-
sures. The improvements are 1-8%. Although
these differences are not statistically significant
by direct comparison, the ??s and ?y?s, which
indicate superiority over FD and PD, suggest
that PD+PRF is superior to FD+PRF in gen-
eral. (Table 2B is an exception: here, there
is no statistical evidence which suggests that
PD+PRF is superior to FD+PRF. However,
note that PD+PRF outperforms FD+PRF on
average even for this test collection.)
 In general, PRF preserves the positive effect of
partial disambiguation. For example, Table 2A
Column (ii) shows that PD is 8% better than
FD, and that PD+PRF is also 8% better than
FD+PRF. (Table 2C is an exception: For ex-
ample, in Column (ii), PD+PRF(Y ) is only 2%
better than FD+PRF(Y ) even though PD(Y ) is
11% better than FD(Y ).)
Thus, the small advantage of partial disambiguation
over full disambiguation is consistent across the five
test collections (six topic sets) and across the two
language permutations.
Table 3(a) compares FD and PD for each test col-
lection in terms of average number of query terms
per topic. For the E-J topics, the PD queries are
approximately three times longer than the FD ones.
Compared to this, the FD and PD queries for the J-E
topics are relatively similar in length. That is, seman-
tic analysis in J-E MT generally yields fewer transla-
tion candidates than that in E-J MT does. However,
the relationship between the number of alternative
translations and the success of partial disambigua-
tion is not straightforward: While the E-J results are
more successful than the J-E results for NTCIR-3
(Table 2A vs D), suggesting that ?adding more terms
is better?, this is not true for NTCIR-2 (Table 2B
vs E). This is probably because the quality of the
alternative translations vary widely, as we shall see
later.
Table 3(b) shows the total number of out-of-
vocabulary words for each topic set. Neither FD
nor PD could translate these words as our general
MT dictionary was not tuned in any way for our ex-
periments. The NTCIR-3 E-J topic set contained
three out-of-vocabulary words, including ?Tomi-
ich? which is a misspelling of ?Tomiichi (Mu-
rayama, a former Japanese prime minister)?, while
the NTCIR-3 J-E topic set contains five, including
?konpyuta?? which is a misspelling of ?konpyu?ta?? or
?konpyu?ta?. Meanwhile, almost all of the out-of-
vocabulary words in the NTCIR-2 E-J and J-E topic
sets were technical terms. However, there was no
topic that contained more than one out-of-vocabulary

word (with one exception), and it appears that out-of-
vocabulary words did not directly affect our experi-
ments: partial disambiguation managed to improve
five of the eight NTCIR-2 J-E topics that contained
an out-of-vocabulary word.
Given that the effect of out-of-vocabulary words
is negligible, one may hypothesize that the advan-
tage of partial disambiguation over full disambigua-
tion may be smaller with technical papers than with
newspapers, as technical papers contain more tech-
nical terms and full disambiguation may be sufficient
for translating them. By comparing the E-J results
(Table 2A-C), it can be observed that partial dis-
ambiguation was indeed a little less successful for
NTCIR-2 E-J (technical papers) than for NTCIR-
3 E-J and BMIR-J2 E-J (newspapers). However,
as our J-E results (Table 2D-E) show comparable
performances for both document types, the above
hypothesis is not fully supported.
4.3 Per-topic Analyses
While partial disambiguation improves retrieval per-
formance on average for all test collections, per-topic
analyses show that it hurts performance for some top-
ics, and that there is room for improvement. Table 4
provides some per-topic comparisons of the Aver-
age Precision values of FD and PD. Two examples
are given for NTCIR-3 E-J and for J-E, respectively,
where the Japanese descriptions for the latter are
shown here in English. Words that are mentioned in
the discussion below are underlined.
As Table 4 shows, PD was hugely successful for
E-J Topic 017: The only word that FD translated cor-
rectly was ?Kitano?: ?Director? was mistranslated as
?kanrisha? (manager), ?Takeshi? was transliterated
into katakana (which is not appropriate in this case),
and ?films? was transliterated into ?firumu? (which
means ?camera films?, not ?movies?). In contrast,
PD successfully recaptured the correct translations
?kantoku? (director) and ?eiga? (films). However,
some inappropriate translations such as ?shikisha?
(orchestra director) and ?torishimariyaku? (manag-
ing director) were added as well, as semantic anal-
ysis is not perfect. Moreover, PD did not help in
translating ?Takeshi?: although it obtained two kanji
spellings for it, they were incorrect for this particular
Takeshi Kitano. (There are more than 40 possible
kanji spellings for ?Takeshi?!) Nevertheless, the use
of synonym operators seems to have absorbed the
negative effect of such inappropriate translations for
this topic. On the other hand, PD was not success-
ful for E-J Topic 004: while FD obtained the cor-
rect translations ?denshisho?torihiki? (E-commerce)
and ?naiyo?? (contents), PD added the acronym of
?E-commerce?, which happened to hit many nonrel-
evant documents that mention ?European Commu-
nity?. (The roman alphabet is often used in Japanese
texts for representing foreign acronyms.) Moreover,
PD added inappropriate translations for ?contents?
such as ?mokuji? (table of contents) and ?yo?ryo?? (ca-
pacity).
PD was also successful for J-E Topic 031: FD
obtained ?optimal? instead of ?best?, and ?place?
instead of ?spot?. In contrast, PD successfully re-
captured ?best? and ?spot?, even though it also added
some possibly harmful terms such as ?position? and
?space?. On the other hand, PD was not success-
ful for J-E Topic 050: FD obtained ?dress? instead
of ?clothing?, to which PD added ?appearance?,
?clothes?, ?costume? and ?garment?. Meanwhile,
FD obtained ?hairstyle? instead of ?hair styles?, to
which PD added ?hairdo? and ?coiffure?. FD ob-
tained ?makeup? instead of ?cosmetics?, to which
PD added ?dressing? and ?toilet?.
As mentioned earlier, while semantic analysis in J-
E MT generally yields fewer translations than that in
E-J MT does, this difference is not clearly reflected in
terms of retrieval performance. One possible cause
of this is that the partial disambiguation terms in the
J-E case are more polysemous, e.g. ?space? and
?toilet?, though fewer in number.
The above examples suggest that partial disam-
biguation may be improved by adopting a more se-
lective strategy. Although we have conducted addi-
tional experiments by limiting the number of terms
added by partial disambiguation, this did not im-
prove performance as the candidate terms obtained
after semantic analysis have no priority information
in our MT system. One possible solution to this is
to utilise the corpus statistics such as the document
frequency so that polysemous words can be filtered
out, but this is beyond the scope of this paper.
Finally, by looking across the columns of Table 2,
it can be observed that the results in terms of MAGR
are generally consistent with those in terms of re-
laxed/rigid MAP. This suggests that MAGR is a good

Japan-Nepal Health Scientific Expedition -Comparative Epidemiological Studies on the
Genesis of Hypertension- (UNDETERMINED)
S1: It is generally thought that the increase in blood pressure with age may be avoided by the extremely low sodium intake.
(BACKGROUND)
S2: we, however, have noticed that blood pressure hardly increased with age in some communities briefly studied in Nepal since
1978, even though the inhabitants take salty foods and beverages.(TOPIC/AIM)
S3: Our purpose was to ascertain this and to clarify the factor(s) influencing no increase in blood pressure with age in terms of
extensive epidemiological standpoint. (TOPIC/AIM)
S9: RESULTS : blood pressure for both sexes was statistically significantly higher in villagers in Bhadrakali than in Kotyang.
(RESULT/CONCLUSION)
S16: CONCLUSION : In spite of consuming more than 10g per day of salt in both Kotyang and Bhadrakali, the blood pressure
hardly increased with age only in the former, suggesting that the blood pressure may be influenced by physical activity, fat free
mass and nutrient consumption rather than salt intake in these villages in Nepal. (RESULT/CONCLUSION)

5 Information Distiller
This section provides some example summaries and
translations to illustrate the usefulness of the Infor-
mation Ditiller for efficient information access, as
well as some preliminary evaluation results of SRA.
5.1 Example Summaries and Translations
As this paper is intended primarily for the English
speaking community, we provide one example sum-
mary in the context of J-E CLIR before they are
translated by MT into Japanese, and two in the con-
text of E-J CLIR after they have been translated by
MT into English. The summaries shown here are all
query-specific, and are based on full disambiguation
queries.
Figure 1 shows a sample summary of an English
technical paper abstract that is S-relevant to NTCIR-
2 J-E Topic 0132, which is about ?correlations be-
tween hypertension and diet.? Of the 16 sentences in
the original document (excluding the title, shown at
the top of this summary), those which do not contain
any of the English query terms and those whose SRs
were UNDETERMINED have been filtered out, leav-
ing only five sentences. The words that matched the
query terms are shown in boldface, and the English
expressions which acted as SRA triggers are under-
lined. For example, Sentence 1 (S1) was tagged with
BACKGROUND because the string ?It is generally
thought? matched a regular expression in one of the
SRA rules. If the user desires an indicative summary,
BRIDJE can present S2 and S3, which are tagged
with TOPIC/AIM. Subsequently, if he desires an in-
formative summary, BRIDJE can present S9 and S16,
which are tagged with RESULT/CONCLUSION. Of
course, the user can specify multiple SRs, choose to
read UNDETERMINED sentences, or combine such
usage with tf -idf -based sentence filtering. Real-
time response is easy because SRA for the documents
are done at index time. Finally, the summary can be
translated into Japanese by MT for the Japanese user.
In the above example, only one SR was assigned
The Cannes International Film Festival is challenged shortly. ? Director Takeshi Kitano and
"chrysanthemum Jiro?s summer" are sent. (TITLE)
S1: The [Paris 22-day cooperation] Director Takeshi Kitano who won Golden Lion (Grand Prix) at the Venice Film Festival in
1997 will send new work "chrysanthemum Jiro?s summer" into a world?s largest film festival and the competition section of the
Cannes International Film Festival. (TOPIC,DATE,TITLE)
S4: It is Director Kitano 8 Motome?s work in "the summer of chrysanthemum Jiro." (TITLE)
Figure 2: A translated summary for NTCIR-3 E-J Topic 017: ?Articles relating [related] to Director Takeshi
Kitano?s films.?
The Emperor and Empress?  is decided. (UNDETERMINED)
S1: The schedule on which the Emperor and Empress visit Britain and Denmark as a guest of the nation was reported to the
cabinet meeting on the 17th, and outlines, such as a welcome event, solidified. (DATE)
S3: Periods are 13 nights and 14 days of May 23 start and June 5 homecoming. (DATE)
S4: After dropping in at Portugal, it will arrive in Britain for 25 days, and from the next day, starting with Queen Elizabeth?s
welcome ceremony, a Japanese company besides a start, 3 times of dinner meetings, and 2 times of luncheons visits Wales to
which it has advanced mostly by day?s trip, or a formal event has a friendly talk [ scientists / of a royal association ]. (DATE)
S5: Arriving in Denmark is on the afternoon of the 31st. (DATE)
S6: Although there is no formal event, events, such as a welcome ceremony, start the royal palace of lodgings on a visit and
following the 2nd, and Queen Margrethe inspects the Copenhagen university, the National Museums, a welfare institution for the
aged, etc., and she will go back Denmark earnestly on the afternoon of the 5th on the night of the 4th on the next day. (DATE)
Figure 3: A translated summary for NTCIR-3 E-J Topic 030: ?When, if ever, has the Japanese Emperor
been to Denmark??
to each fragment (i.e. sentence) for simplicity. How-
ever, SRs can be used as orthogonal features, as
shown in the next example.
Figure 2 shows a sample translated summary (i.e.
an MT output) of a Japanese newspaper article that
is S-relevant to NTCIR-3 E-J Topic 017: ?Articles
relating [related] to Director Takeshi Kitano?s films.?
Words that match those from the source language re-
quest are indicated in boldface, and words that corre-
spond to the Japanese SRA triggers are underlined.
As the search request ends with the word ?films?, it is
possible for BRIDJE to guess that movie titles may be
useful to the user. Thus, BRIDJE can show S1 and S4
to the user by default, as they have been tagged with
TITLE based on SRA triggers such as ?kantoku?
(director), ?sakuhin? (work) and Japanese brackets.
Note also that S1 has two more SRs, TOPIC and
DATE. Unfortunately, the correct English translation
of the movie title is ?Kikujiro?s summer?: Kikujiro
is a very unusual Japanese name, while Jiro is a com-
mon first name. Besides, kiku does mean chrysan-
themum the flower! Nevertheless, we view this ex-
ample as one step towards cross-language question
answering, which deals with questions such as ?List
up Takeshi Kitano?s Japanese films - give me rough
translations in English.?
Similarly, Figure 3 shows a translated summary
of a Japanese newspaper article that is S-relevant to
NTCIR-3 E-J Topic 030: ?When, if ever, has the
Japanese Emperor been to Denmark??. By perform-
ing SRA on this ?when? question, it is possible for
BRIDJE to guess that the user is looking for DATE-
type information, as in question answering. In such a
case, BRIDJE can present a list of sentences contain-
ing dates as shown. Even though the translations are
far from perfect, the English speaking user can prob-
ably guess, by reading S3, S5, and S6 that the answer
to the question is ?from May 31st to June 4th or 5th?.
Combining this with the meta-data of this document,
a sophisticated cross-language question answering
system would output the year ?1998? as well. Un-
fortunately, the document title in Figure 3 contains
a kanji word which MT failed to translate: ?ho?o?bi?
(dates for visiting Europe), shown as ?? in
this paper to avoid Japanese fonts.
The above three examples illustrate the usefulness
of SRA for efficient access to the desired informa-
tion within an English or a Japanese document, and
for allowing different views for summarising a doc-
ument. Moreover, we have argued that current MT
technology can be useful for CLIA despite its limited
quality. By performing SRA-based sentence filter-
ing, the amount of MT output that the user has to go
through can be kept to a minimum.

5.2 Precision of SRA
As the Information Distiller is an interactive sub-
system, user-oriented, overall usefulness evaluations
should be performed. As a first step, however, we
evaluate the precision of the SRA rule sets that were
actually used to generate the aforementioned exam-
ples. The results reported here are only indicative as
the rule sets are experimental versions.
By using S-relevant documents as training data,
one SRA rule set was devised for each of the four
document collections: NTCIR-2 English/Japanese
(technical papers) and NTCIR-3 English/Japanese
(newspapers). Then, for each collection, we pre-
pared a test set of documents A as follows: Let S
and A be the set of unique S-relevant and A-relevant
documents, respectively. Take 100 A-relevant doc-
uments at random from the set A  S and let this
set be A. This ensures that the test sets consist of
unknown documents only, even if a document that is
A-relevant for a certain topic is S-relevant for another
topic.
SRA was performed on all fragments (i.e. sen-
tences) from A for each collection. Then, the
first author examined each fragment and judged
whether the assigned SR was ?acceptable? or not.
Here, ?unacceptable? SRs are those that would

probably mislead the user: For example, if a
fragment from a technical paper is tagged with
RESULT/CONCLUSION even though the fragment
in fact provides a BACKGROUND information, this
may cause a misunderstanding and is therefore un-
acceptable. Note also that this evaluation concerns
generic summary fragments, as they subsume query-
focused ones.
We define SRA precision as the number of frag-
ments with acceptable SRs divided by the total num-
ber of fragments. We do not consider its recall coun-
terpart here, because the Information Distiller is sup-
posed to filter out many sentences and present ?typi-
cal? sentences only. Although our current SRA rule
sets assign SRs to only a small fraction of given frag-
ments, the user can choose to read UNDETERMINED
sentences or select multiple SRs at any time, as dis-
cussed earlier. Thus, the aim of this lenient eval-
uation is to ensure that the output of Information
Distiller will ?look okay? to the user.
Tables 5 and 6 summarise our SRA precision re-
sults. Table 5A corresponds to the NTCIR-2 En-
glish SRA rule set (which was used to generate the
summary in Figure 1), and 5B corresponds to the

NTCIR-2 Japanese SRA rule set. Table 6C cor-
responds to the NTCIR-3 English SRA rule set,
and 6D corresponds to the NTCIR-3 Japanese SRA
rule set (which was used to generate the original
Japanese summaries for Figures 2 and 3). For
example, Table 5A includes information such as:
(a) Of the 592 fragments extracted from the test
set A, only 138 (23%) were tagged with an SR;
(b) Of the above 138 fragments, 58 were tagged
with RESULT/CONCLUSION, but one of them was
judged as unacceptable. Hence the Precision for
this SR is 57/58=98%; (c) As the abovementioned
fragment was the only unacceptable one, the overall
precision is 137/138=99%.
The one unacceptable fragment tagged with
RESULT/CONCLUSION was: ?As Kipps?s recog-
nition algorithm does not give us a way to extract
any parsing result, his algorithm is not considered
as a practical parsing algorithm.? which acciden-
tally matched an SRA rule that included ?result? as a
trigger. As shown in Table 7A, this fragment should
probably be tagged with BACKGROUND, since it dis-
cusses previous work rather than the author?s present
work.
Similarly, Tables 5B and 7B show the results for
the NTCIR-2 Japanese SRA rule set which is very
similar to its English counterpart. As there were five
unacceptable cases, its overall precision is 97%.
Tables 6C and 7C show the results for the NTCIR-
3 English SRA rule set. Three fragments tagged with
TOPIC were judged as unacceptable, one of which
was: ?But I?ve always said that I won?t compromise
when it comes to demanding that the facts surround-
ing the incident come out in the open.? This fragment
accidentally matched an SRA trigger ?said that?, de-
signed to match fragments such as ?The prime min-
ister said that. . . ?
Tables 6D and 7D show the results for the NTCIR-
3 Japanese SRA rule set. Unlike the other SRA rule
sets, the SRs in this rule set were defined as or-
thogonal features, which allowed multiple SRs per
fragment as in Figure 2. (Hence the SubTotal row
provides information on distinct fragments.) As
many as 18 fragments were incorrectly tagged with
COMMENT, due to our reliance on Japanese brack-
ets as SRA triggers: words surrounded by brackets
are often technical terms or movie/book titles, rather
than quoted comments. Moreover, two fragments
were incorrectly tagged withDATE as they contained
the word ?ichinichi? (one day), whose spelling is the
same as ?tsuitachi? (first [of January]).
To summarise our preliminary results: Our ex-
perimental SRA rule sets can assign SRs to 13-31%
of completely unknown English/Japanese sentences
(but from known document genres), with precision
of 95-99%. Moreover, SRA precision would be even
higher for query-focused summaries. Thus, the SRs
presented by the Information Distiller would proba-
bly look satisfactory to the user.
6 Conclusions
This paper introduced two new features of the
BRIDJE system, namely, partial disambiguation
for effective CLIR and document summarisa-
tion/presentation based on Semantic Role Analysis.
We showed that the advantage of partial disambigua-
tion over full disambiguation is consistent across five
test collections, with four English-Japanese and two
Japanese-English topic sets. As for document pre-
sentation using the Information Distiller, we have
provided examples as well as preliminary evalua-
tions to show that it can be useful for efficient and
interactive cross-language information access. Top-
ics of our future work include:
 Improving partial disambiguation by being
more selective;
 Extensive and user-oriented evaluations of the
Information Distiller;
 User-oriented query expansion using the Infor-
mation Distiller;
 Expanding our language scope, for example, to
Chinese; and
 Building a true cross-language question answer-
ing system.
