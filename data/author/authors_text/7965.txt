Abstract 
In this paper, we explain a rapid devel-
opment method of multimodal dialogue 
sys-tem using MIML (Multimodal Inter-
action Markup Language), which defines 
dialogue patterns between human and 
various types of interactive agents. The 
feature of this language is three-layered 
description of agent-based interactive 
systems which separates task level de-
scription, interaction description and de-
vice dependent realization. MIML has 
advantages in high-level interaction de-
scription, modality extensibility and 
compatibility with standardized tech-
nologies. 
1 Introduction 
In recent years, various types of interactive 
agents, such as personal robots, life-like agents 
(Kawamoto et al 2004), and animated agents are 
developed for many purposes. Such interactive 
agents have an ability of speech communication 
with human by using automatic speech recog-
nizer and speech synthesizer as a main modality 
of communication. The purpose of these interac-
tive agents is to realize a user-friendly interface 
for information seeking, remote operation task, 
entertainment, etc. 
Each agent system is controlled by different 
description language. For example, Microsoft 
agent is controlled by JavaScript / VBScript em-
bedded in HTML files, Galatea (Kawamoto et al. 
2004) is controlled by extended VoiceXML (in 
Linux version) and XISL (Katsurada et al 2003) 
(in Windows version). In addition to this differ-
ence, these languages do not have the ability of 
higher level task definition because the main 
elements of these languages are the control of 
modality functions for each agent. These make 
rapid development of multimodal system diffi-
cult.  
In order to deal with these problems, we pro-
pose a multimodal interaction description lan-
guage, MIML (Multimodal Interaction Markup 
Language), which defines dialogue patterns be-
tween human and various types of interactive 
agents by abstracting their functions. The feature 
of this language is three-layered description of 
agent-based interactive systems.  
The high-level description is a task definition 
that can easily construct typical agent-based in-
teractive task control information. The middle-
level description is an interaction description that 
defines agent?s behavior and user?s input at the 
granularity of dialogue segment. The low-level 
description is a platform dependent description 
that can override the pre-defined function in the 
interaction description.  
The connection between task-level and inter-
action-level is realized by generation of interac-
tion description templates from the task level 
description. The connection between interaction-
level and platform-level is realized by a binding 
mechanism of XML.  
The rest of this paper consists as follows. Sec-
tion 2 describes the specification of the proposed 
language. Section 3 explains a process of rapid 
multimodal dialogue system development. Sec-
tion 4 gives a comparison with existing multi-
modal languages. Section 5 states conclusions 
and future works.

2.1 Task level markup language 
2.1.1 Task classification 
In spoken dialogue system development, we pro-
posed task classification based on the direction 
of information flow (Araki et al 1999). We con-
sider that the same analysis can be applied to 
agent based interactive systems (see Table 1).

active systems

Question 
and Answer 
 
user                 agent daily life in-
formation query
 
In the information assistant class, the agent 
has information to be presented to the user. 
Typically, the information contents are Web 
pages, an instruction of consumer product usage, 
an educational content, etc. Sometimes the con-
tents are too long to deliver all the information to 
the user. Therefore, it needs user model that can 
manage user?s preference and past interaction 
records in order to select or filter out the contents. 
In the user agent class, the user has informa-
tion to be delivered to the agent in order to 
achieve a user?s goal. Typically, the information 
is a command to control networked home 
equipments, travel schedule to reserve a train 
ticket, etc. The agent mediates between user and 
target application in order to make user?s input 
appropriate and easy at the client side process 
(e.g. checking a mandatory filed to be filled, 
automatic filling with personal data (name, ad-
dress, e-mail, etc.)). 
In the Question and Answer class, the user has 
an intention to acquire some information from 
the agent that can access to the Web or a data-
base. First, the user makes a query in natural lan-
guage, and then the agent makes a response ac-
cording to the result of the information retrieval. 
If too much information is retrieved, the agent 
makes a narrowing down subdialogue. If there is 
no information that matches user?s query, the 
agent makes a request to reformulate an initial 
query. If the amount of retrieved information is 
appropriate to deliver to the user by using current 
modality, the agent reports the results to the user. 
The appropriate amount of information differs in 
the main interaction modality of the target device, 
such as small display, normal graphic display or 
speech. Therefore, it needs the information of 
media capability of the target device. 
2.1.2 Overview of task markup language 
As a result of above investigation, we specify 
the task level interaction description language 
shown in Figure 1.

Figure. 1  Structure of the Task Markup Lan-
guage. 
 
The features of this language are (1) the ability 
to model each participant of dialogue (i.e. user 
and agent) and (2) to provide an execution 
framework of each class of task.  
The task markup language <taskml> consists 
of two parts corresponding to above mentioned 
features: <head> part and <body> part. The 
<head> part specifies models of the user (by 
<userModel> element) and the agent (by <de-
viceModel> element). The content of each model 
is described in section 2.1.3. The <body> part 
specifies a class of interaction task. The content 
of each task is declaratively specified under the 
<section>, <xforms> and <qa> elements, which 
are explained in section 2.1.4. 
2.1.3 Head part of task markup language 
In the <head> element of the task markup lan-
guage, the developer can specify user model in 
<userModel> element and agent model in <de-
viceModel> element.  
In the <userModel> element, the developer 
declares variables which represent user?s infor-
mation, such as expertise to domain, expertise to 
dialogue system, interest level to the contents, 
etc.  
In the <deviceModel> element, the developer 
can specify the type of interactive agent and 
main modality of interaction. This information is 
(* means the 
element can 
repeat more 
than 1 time) 
110
used for generating template from this task de-
scription to interaction descriptions. 
2.1.4 Body part of task markup language 
According to the class of the task, the <body> 
element consists of a sequence of <section> ele-
ments, a <xforms> element or a <qa> element. 
The <section> element represents a piece of 
information in the task of the information assis-
tant class. The attributes of this element are id, 
start time and end time of the presentation mate-
rial and declared user model variable which indi-
cates whether this section meets the user?s needs 
or knowledge level. The child elements of the 
<section> element specify multimodal presenta-
tion. These elements are the same set of the child 
elements of <output> element in the interaction 
level description explained in the next subsection. 
Also, there is a <interaction> element as a child 
element of the <section> element which specifies 
agent interaction pattern description as an exter-
nal pointer. It is used for additional comment 
generated by the agent to the presented contents. 
For the sake of this separation of contents and 
additional comments, the developer can easily 
add agent?s behavior in accordance with the user 
model. The interaction flow of this class is 
shown in Figure 2.

Figure. 2  Interaction flow of Information Assist 
class 
The <xforms> element represents a group of 
information in the task of the user agent class. It 
specifies a data model, constraint of the value 
and submission action following the notation of 
XForms 1.0.  
In the task of user agent class, the role of in-
teractive agent is to collect information from the 
user in order to achieve a specific task, such as 
hotel reservation. XForms is designed to separate 
the data structure of information and the appear-
ance at the user?s client, such as using text field 
input, radio button, pull-down menu, etc. because 
such interface appearances are different in de-
vices even in GUI-based systems. If the devel-
oper wants to use multimodal input for the user?s 
client, such separation of the data structure and 
the appearance, i.e. how to show the necessary 
information and how to get user?s input, is very 
important.  
In MIML, such device dependent ?appearance? 
information is defined in interaction level. There-
fore, in this user agent class, the task description 
is only to define data structure because interac-
tion flows of this task can be limited to the typi-
cal patterns. For example, in hotel reservation, as 
a result of AP (application) access, if there is no 
available room at the requested date, the user?s 
reservation request is rejected. If the system rec-
ommends an alternative choice to the user, the 
interaction branches to subdialogue of recom-
mendation, after the first user?s request is proc-
essed (see Figure 3). The interaction pattern of 
each subdialogue is described in the interaction 
level markup language.

Figure. 3  Interaction flow of User Agent class 
 
The <qa> element consists of three children: 
<query>, <search> and <result>.  
The content of <query> element is the same as 
the <xforms> element explained above. However, 
generated interaction patterns are different in 
user agent class and question and answer class. 
In user agent class, all the values (except for op-
tional slots indicated explicitly) are expected to 
be filled. On the contrary, in question and answer 
class, a subset of slots defined by form descrip-
tion can make a query. Therefore, the first ex-
111
change of the question and answer class task is 
system?s prompt and user?s query input.  
The <search> element represents application 
command using the variable defined in the 
<query> element. Such application command 
can be a database access command or SPARQL 
(Simple Protocol And RDF Query Language)1 in 
case of Semantic Web search.  
The <result> element specifies which informa-
tion to be delivered to the user from the query 
result. The behavior of back-end application of 
this class is not as simple as user agent class. If 
too many results are searched, the system transits 
to narrowing down subdialogue. If no result is 
searched, the system transits to subdialogue that 
relaxes initial user?s query. If appropriate num-
ber (it depends on presentation media) of results 
are searched, the presentation subdialogue begins. 
The flow of interaction is shown in Figure 4.

2.2 Interaction level markup language 
2.2.1 Overview of interaction markup lan-
guage 
Previously, we proposed a multimodal interac-
tion markup language (Araki et al 2004) as an 
extension of VoiceXML2. In this paper, we mod-
ify the previous proposal for specializing human-
agent interaction and for realizing interaction 
pattern defined in the task level markup language.  
The main extension is a definition of modality 
independent elements for input and output. In 
VoiceXML, system?s audio prompt is defined in 
<prompt> element as a child of <field> element

2 http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml20/ 
that defines atomic interaction acquiring the 
value of the variable. User?s speech input pattern 
is defined by <grammar> element under <field> 
element. In our MIML, <grammar> element is 
replaced by the <input> element which specifies 
active input modalities and their input pattern to 
be bund to the variable that is indicated as name 
attribute of the <field> element. Also, <prompt> 
element is replaced by the <output> element 
which specifies active output modalities and a 
source media file or contents to be presented to 
the user. In <output> element, the developer can 
specify agent?s behavior by using <agent> ele-
ment. The outline of this interaction level 
markup language is shown in Figure 5.

Language 
2.2.2 Input and output control in agent 
The <input> element and the <output> element 
are designed for implementing various types of 
interactive agent systems. 
The <input> element specifies the input proc-
essing of each modality. For speech input, 
grammar attribute of <speech> element specifies 
user?s input pattern by SRGS (Speech Recogni-
tion Grammar Specification)3 , or alternatively, 
type attribute specifies built-in grammar such as 
Boolean, date, digit, etc. For image input, type 
attribute of <image> element specifies built-in 
behavior for camera input, such as nod, faceRec-
ognition, etc. For touch input, the value of the 
variable is given by referring external definition 
of the relation between displayed object and its 
value. 
The <output> element specifies the output 
control of each modality. Each child element of

this element is performed in parallel. If the de-
veloper wants to make sequential output, it 
should be written in <smil> element (Synchro-
nized Multimedia Integration Language) 4 , For 
audio output, <audio> element works as the 
same way as VoiceXML, that is, the content of 
the element is passed to TTS (Text-to-Speech 
module) and if the audio file is specified by the 
src attribute, it is a prior output. In <video>, 
<page> (e.g. HTML) and <smil> (for rich mul-
timedia presentation) output, each element speci-
fies the contents file by src attribute. In <agent> 
element, the agent?s behavior definition, such as 
move, emotion, status attribute specifies the pa-
rameter for each action. 
2.3 Platform level description 
The differences of agent and other devices for 
input/output are absorbed in this level. In interac-
tion level markup language, <agent> element 
specifies agent?s behavior. However, some agent 
can move in a real world (e.g. personal robot), 
some agent can move on a computer screen (e.g. 
Microsoft Agent), and some cannot move but 
display their face (e.g. life-like agent). 
One solution for dealing with such variety of 
behavior is to define many attributes at <agent> 
element, for example, move, facial expression, 
gesture, point, etc. However, the defects of this 
solution are inflexibility of correspondence to 
progress of agent technology (if an agent adds 
new ability to its behavior, the specification of 
language should be changed) and interference of 
reusability of interaction description (description 
for one agent cannot apply to another agent).  
Our solution is to use the binding mechanism 
in XML language between interaction level and 
platform dependent level. We assume default 
behavior for each value of the move, emotion 
and status attributes of the <agent> element. If 
such default behavior is not enough for some 
purpose, the developer can override the agent?s 
behavior using binding mechanism and the 
agent?s native control language. As a result, the 
platform level description is embedded in bind-
ing language described in next section. 
3 Rapid system development 
3.1 Usage of application framework 
Each task class has a typical execution steps as 
investigated in previous section. Therefore a sys-
tem developer has to specify a data model and 
                                                 
4 http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/ 
specific information for each task execution. 
Web application framework can drive interactive 
task using these declarative parameters. 
As an application framework, we use Struts5 
which is based on Model-View-Controller (MVC) 
model. It clearly separates application logic 
(model part), transition of interaction (controller 
part) and user interface (view part). Although 
MVC model is popular in GUI-based Web appli-
cation, it can be applied in speech-based applica-
tion because any modality dependent information 
can be excluded from the view part. Struts pro-
vides (1) a controller mechanism and (2) integra-
tion mechanism with the back-end application 
part and the user interface part. In driving Struts, 
a developer has to (1) define a data class which 
stores the user?s input and responding results, (2) 
make action mapping rules which defines a tran-
sition pattern of the target interactive system, and 
(3) make the view part which defines human-
computer interaction patterns. The process of 
Struts begins by the request from the user client 
(typically in HTML, form data is submitted to 
the Web server via HTTP post method).  
The controller catches the request and stores 
the submitted data to the data class, and then 
calls the action class specified by the request fol-
lowing the definition of action mapping rules.  
The action class communicates with the back-
end application, such as database management 
system or outside Web servers by referring the 
data class, and returns the status of the process-
ing to the controller. According to the status, the 
controller refers the action mapping rules and 
selects the view file which is passed to the user?s 
client. Basically, this view file is written in Java 
Server Pages, which can be any XML file that 
includes Java code or useful tag libraries. Using 
this embedded programming method, the results 
of the application processing is reflected to the 
response. The flow of processing in the Struts is 
shown in Figure 6.

The first step of rapid development is to pre-
pare backend application (Typically using Data-
base Management System) and their application 
logic code. The action mapping file and data 
class file are created automatically from the task 
level description described next subsection. 
3.2 Task definition 
Figure 7 shows an example description of the 
information assistant task. In this task setting, 
video contents which are divided into sections 
are presented to the user one by one. At the end 
of a section, a robot agent put in a word in order 
to help user?s understanding and to measure the 
user?s preference (e.g. by the recognition of ac-
knowledging, nodding, etc.) . If low user?s pref-
erence is observed, unimportant parts of the 
presentation are skipped and comments of the 
robot are adjusted to beginner?s level. The im-
portance of the section is indicated by interes-
tLevel attribute and knowledgeLevel attribute 
that are introduced in the <userModel> element. 
If one of the values of these attribute is below the 
current value of the user model, the relevant sec-
tion is skipped. The skipping mechanism using 
user model variables is automatically inserted 
into an interaction level description. 
Figure. 7  An Example of Task Markup Lan-
guage. 
3.3 Describing Interaction 
The connection between task-level and interac-
tion-level is realized by generation of interaction 
description templates from the task level descrip-
tion. The interaction level description corre-
sponds to the view part of the MVC model on 
which task level description is based. From this 
point of view, task level language specification 
gives higher level parameters over MVC frame-
work which restricts behavior of the model for 
typical interactive application patterns. Therefore, 
from this pattern information, the skeletons of 
the view part of each typical pattern can be gen-
erated based on the device model information in 
task markup language.  
For example, by the task level description 
shown in Figure 7, data class is generated from 
<userModel> element by mapping the field of 
the class to user model variable, and action map-
ping rule set is generated using the sequence in-
formation of <section> elements. The branch is 
realized by calling application logic which com-
pares the attribute variables of the <section> and 
user model data class. Following action mapping 
rule, the interaction level description is generated 
for each <section> element. In information assis-
tant class, a <section> element corresponds to 
two interaction level descriptions: the one is pre-
senting contents which transform <video> ele-
ment to the <output> elements and the other is 
interacting with user, such as shown in Figure 8.  
The latter file is merely a skeleton. Therefore, 
the developer has to fill the system?s prompt, 
specify user?s input and add corresponding ac-
tions. 
Figure 8 describes an interaction as follows: at 
the end of some segment, the agent asks the user 
whether the contents are interesting or not. The 
user can reply by speech or by nodding gesture. 
If the user?s response is affirmative, the global 
variable of interest level in user model is incre-
mented.

3.4 Adaptation to multiple interaction de-
vices 
The connection between interaction-level and 
platform-level is realized by binding mechanism 
of XML. XBL (XML Binding Language)6 was 
originally defined for smart user interface de-
scription, extended for SVG afterwards, and fur-
thermore, for general XML language. The con-
cept of binding in XBL is a tree extension by 
inheriting the value of attributes to the sub tree 
(see Figure 9). As a result of this mechanism, the 
base language, in this the case interaction 
markup language, can keep its simplicity but 
does not loose flexibility.

By using this mechanism, we implemented 
various types of weather information system,

such as Microsoft agent (Figure 10), Galatea 
(Figure 11) and a personal robot. The platform 
change is made only by modifying agentType 
attribute of <deviceModel> element of taskML.

4 Comparison with existing multimodal 
language 
There are several multimodal interaction systems, 
mainly in research level (L?pez-C?zar and Araki 
2005). XHTML+Voice 7  and SALT 8  are most 
popular multimodal interaction description lan-
guages. These two languages concentrate on how 
to add speech interaction on graphical Web 
pages by adding spoken dialogue description to 
(X)HTML codes. These are not suitable for a 
description of virtual agent interactions. 
(Fernando D?Haro et al 2005) proposes new 
multimodal languages for several layers. Their 
proposal is mainly on development environment 
which supports development steps but for lan-
guage itself. In contrary to that, our proposal is a

simplified language and framework that auto-
mate several steps for system development. 
5 Conclusion and future works 
In this paper, we explained a rapid development 
method of multimodal dialogue system using 
MIML. This language can be extended for more 
complex task settings, such as multi-scenario 
presentation and multiple-task agents. Although 
it is difficult to realize multi-scenario presenta-
tion by the proposed filtering method, it can be 
treated by extending filtering concept to discrete 
variable and enriching the data type of <user-
Model> variables. For example, if the value of 
<knowledgeLevel> variable in Figure 7 can take 
one of ?expert?, ?moderate? and ?novice?, and 
each scenario in multi-scenario presentation is 
marked with these values, multi-scenario presen-
tation can be realized by filtering with discrete 
variables. In case of multiple-task agents, we can 
implement such agents by adding one additional 
interaction description which guides to branch 
various tasks.
