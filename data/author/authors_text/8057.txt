Abstract 
This paper describes a rule-learning approach 
towards Chinese prosodic phrase prediction for 
TTS systems. Firstly, we prepared a speech 
corpus having about 3000 sentences and 
manually labelled the sentences with two-level 
prosodic structure. Secondly, candidate 
features related to prosodic phrasing and the 
corresponding prosodic boundary labels are 
extracted from the corpus text to establish an 
example database. A series of comparative 
experiments is conducted to figure out the 
most effective features from the candidates. 
Lastly, two typical rule learning algorithms 
(C4.5 and TBL) are applied on the example 
database to induce prediction rules. The paper 
also suggests general evaluation parameters for 
prosodic phrase prediction. With these 
parameters, our methods are compared with 
RNN and bigram based statistical methods on 
the same corpus. The experiments show that 
the automatic rule-learning approach can 
achieve better prediction accuracy than the 
non-rule based methods and yet retain the 
advantage of the simplicity and 
understandability of rule systems. Thus it is 
justified as an effective alternative to prosodic 
phrase prediction. 
1 Introduction 
Prosodic phrase prediction or prosodic 
phrasing plays an important role in improving 
the naturalness and intelligence of TTS 
systems. Linguistic research shows that the 
utterance produced by human is structured in a 
hierarchy of prosodic units, including 
phonological phrase, intonation phrase and 
utterance. (Abney, 1995) But the output of text 
analysis of TTS systems is often a structure of 
syntactic units, such as words or phrases, 
which are not equivalent to the prosodic ones. 
Therefore the object of prosodic phrasing is to 
map the syntactic structure into its prosodic 
counterpart. 
A lot of methods have been introduced to 
predict prosodic phrase in English text such as 
Classification and Regression Tree (Wang and 
Hirschberg, 1992), Hidden Markov Model 
(Paul and Alan, 1998). For Chinese prosodic 
phrasing, the traditional method is based on 
handcrafted rules. Recurrent Neural Network 
(Ying and Shi, 2001) as well as POS bigram 
and CART based methods (Yao and Min, 2001) 
is also experimented recently. Due to the 
difference in training corpus and evaluation 
methods between researchers, these results are 
generally less comparable. 
In this paper, a rule-learning approach is 
proposed to predict prosodic phrase in 
unrestricted Chinese text. Rule-based systems 
are simple and easy to understand. But 
handcrafted rules are usually difficult to 
construct, maintain and evaluate. Thus two 
typical rule-learning algorithms (C4.5 
induction and transformation-based learning) 
are employed to automatically induce 
prediction rules from examples instead of 
human. Generally speaking, automatic 
rule-learning has two obvious advantages over 
the previous methods: 
1) Statistical methods like bigram or HMM 
usually need large training corpus to 
avoid sparse data problem while 
rule-learning doesn?t have the restriction. 
In the case of prosodic phrase prediction, 
the corpus with prosodic labelling is often 
relatively small. Rule-learning is just 
suitable for this task. 
2) CART, RNN or other neural network 
methods have good learning ability but 
the learned knowledge is represented as 
trees or network weights, which are not so 
much understandable as rules. 
Once rules are learned from examples, they 
can be analyzed by human to check if they 
agree with the common linguistic knowledge. 
We can add prediction rules converted from 
our linguistic knowledge to the rule set, which 
is especially useful when the training corpus 
doesn?t cover wide enough phenomena of 
prosodic phrasing. Furthermore, we can try to 
interpret and understand rules learned by 
machine so as to enrich our linguistic 
knowledge. Hence rule-learning also helps us 
mine knowledge from examples. 
Since features related to prosodic phrasing 
come from various linguistic sources, several 
comparative experiments are conducted to 
select the most effective features from the 
candidates. The paper also suggests general 
evaluation parameters for prosodic phrase 
prediction. With these parameters, our methods 
are compared with RNN and bigram based 
statistical methods on the same corpus. The 
experiments show that the automatic 
rule-learning approach can achieve better 
prediction accuracy than the non-rule based 
methods and yet retain the advantage of the 
simplicity and understandability of rule 
systems. The paper proceeds as follows. 
Section 2 introduces the rule-learning 
algorithms we used. Section 3 describes 
prosodic phrase prediction and its evaluation 
parameters. Section 4 discusses the feature 
selection and rule-learning experiments in 
detail. Section 5 reports the evaluation results 
of rule based and none-rule based methods. 
Section 6 presents the conclusion and the view 
of future work.  
2 Rule Learning Algorithms 
Research on machine learning has 
concentrated in the main on inducing rules 
from unordered set of examples. And 
knowledge represented in a collection of rules 
is understandable and effective way to realize 
some kind of intelligence. C4.5 (Quinlan, 1986) 
and transformation-based learning (Brill, 1995) 
are typical rule-learning algorithms that have 
been applied to various NLP tasks such as 
part-of-speech tagging and named entity 
extraction etc. 
Both algorithms are supervised learning and 
can be used to induce rules from examples. 
But they also have difference from each other. 
Firstly the C4.5 rule induction is a completely 
automatic process. What we need to do is to 
extract appropriate features for our problem. 
As to transformation-based learning 
(henceforth TBL), transformation rule 
templates, which determine the effectiveness 
of the acquired rules, have to be designed 
manually before learning. Thus TBL can only 
be viewed as a semi-automatic method. 
Secondly the induction of C4.5 rules using a 
divide-and-conquer strategy is much faster 
than the greedy searching for TBL ones. In 
view of the above facts, C4.5 rules are induced 
from examples first in our experiments. And 
then the rules are used to guide the design of 
rule templates for TBL. See section 4.8 for 
detail. 
3 Prosodic Phrase Prediction 
3.1 The Methodology 
Linguistic research has suggested that Chinese 
utterance is also structured in a prosodic 
hierarchy, in which there are mainly three 
levels of prosodic units: prosodic word, 
prosodic phrase and intonation phrase (Li and 
Lin, 2000).. Figure 1 shows the prosodic 
structure of a Chinese sentence. In the tree 
structure, the non-leaf nodes are prosodic units 
and the leaves are syntactic words. A prosodic 
phrase is composed of several prosodic words, 
each of which in turn consists of several 
syntactic words. Since intonation phrase is 
usually indicated by punctuation marks, we 
only need to consider the prediction of 
prosodic word and phrase.

Figure 1: Two-level prosodic structure tree (U 
for intonation phrase, PP for prosodic phrase, 
PW for prosodic word) 
Suppose we have a string of syntactic words 
i.e.
nwww ,..., 21 , the boundary between two 
neighbouring words is represented 
as >?< +1ii ww . There are total three types of 
boundaries labelled as B0 ( 1, +ii ww  are in the 
same prosodic word), B1 (the words are in the 
same prosodic phrase, but not the same 
prosodic word), or B2 (the words are in 
different prosodic phrases) respectively. Thus 
prosodic phrase prediction is to predict such 
boundary labels, which can be viewed as a 
classification task. We believe these labels are 
determined by the contextual linguistic 
information around the boundary. If we have a 
speech corpus with prosodic labelling, features 
related to prosodic phrasing can be extracted at 
each boundary and combined with the 
corresponding boundary labels to establish an 
example database. Then rule-learning 
algorithms are executed on the database to 
induce rules for predicting boundary labels. 
3.2 Evaluation Parameters 
As a classification task, prosodic phrase 
prediction should be evaluated with 
consideration on all the classes. The rules 
induced from examples are applied on a test 
corpus to predict the label of each boundary. 
The predicted labels are compared with labels 
given by human, which are thought to be true, 
to get a confusion matrix as follows: 
Predicted labels True 
labels  B0 B1 B2 
B0 C00 C01 C02 
B1 C10 C11 C12 
B2 C20 C21 C22 
Table 1: Confusion matrix 
Cijs are the counts of boundaries whose true 
label are Bi but predicted as Bj. From these 
counts, we can deduce the evaluation 
parameters for prosodic phrasing.

icRe  defines the recall rate of boundary 
label Bi. iePr  defines the precision rate of 
Bi. iF  is a combination of recall and precision 
rate, suggested by (Rijsbergen, 1979). 1Acc  is 
the overall accuracy of all the labels. If we 
merge B1 and B2 into one label, which can be 
viewed as   the prediction of prosodic word 
boundary, 2Acc defines the overall accuracy of 
this case.  
4 Experiments 
4.1 The Corpus 
In our experiments, the speech corpus of our 
TTS system is used for training and testing. 
The corpus has 3167 sentences, which are 
randomly selected from newspaper and read 
by a radiobroadcaster. We manually labelled 
the sentences with two-level prosodic structure 
by listening to the record speech. For example, 
the sentence in Figure 1 is labelled as ?5?/ B1
??/B0Z/B1?/B0X/B06?/B2J/B1t?/B0
Z /B1 ? ? /B0 ? W /B0 X /B1 J ? /B2?.  
Preliminary tests show that manually labelling 
can achieve a high consistency rate among 
human. Therefore it is reasonable to make the 
manually labelled results as the target of 
learning algorithms. 
The sentences of the corpus are also 
processed with a text analyzer, where Chinese 
word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging 
are accomplished in one step using a statistical 
language model. The segmentation and 
tagging yields a gross accuracy rate over 94%. 
The output of the text analyzer is directly used 
as the training data of learning algorithms 
without correcting segmentation or tagging 
errors because we want to train classifiers with 
noisy data in the real situation. 
Here are some statistical figures about the 
corpus. There are 56446 Chinese characters in 
the corpus, which constitute 37669 words. The 
number of prosodic word boundaries is 16194 
and that of prosodic phrase ones is only 7231. 
The average length of syntactic word, prosodic 
word, prosodic phrase and sentence are 1.5, 
2.4, 7.8 and 17.0 in character, respectively. 
4.2 Candidate Features  
Feature selection is crucial to the classification 
of prosodic boundary labels. Linguistic 
information around the word boundary is the 
main source of features. The features may 
come from different levels including syllable, 
word, phrase, sentence level. And the type of 
features may be phonetic, lexical, syntactic, 
semantic or pragmatic. Which features have 
most close relation with prosodic phrasing and 
how to represent them are still open research 
problems. In our approach, we decide to list all 
the possible features first and figure out the 
most effective ones by experiments. The 
features we currently consider are presented in 
the following. 
4.2.1 Phonetic information 
Chinese is well known as a monosyllabic, 
tonal language. And phonetic study shows 
sound will change in continuous speech 
because of context or prosodic structure. 
Retroflex, neutral tone and tone sandhi are 
important phonetic phenomena that cause 
sound variation. (Li and Lin, 2000). Thus 
phonetic information about phone and syllable 
is related to prosodic phasing. There are too 
many tonal syllables (about 1300) in Chinese 
to consider. Instead, the initials and finals of 
the syllables (total about 60) near a word 
boundary are taken into accounts, which are 
represented as SYIF in the following text. 
Similarly the tones of the syllables, denoted by 
TONE, are also included as phonetic features. 
4.2.2    Lexical information 
Words in natural language have different 
occurrence frequency. And words that have 
high occurrence frequency may be especially 
important to prosodic phrasing (e.g. some 
functional words in Chinese,  X? ` 
etc). Therefore lexical word is treated as a 
candidate feature, represented as WORD.  
4.2.3 Syntactic information 
Syntactic information has close relation with 
prosodic structure. POS, which denotes 
part-of-speech of words, is a basic syntactic 
feature much easier to obtain with automatic 
POS taggers. And it has been widely adopted 
in previous researches. Since POS tag sets 
varies with taggers, we try to determine the 
best one for predicting prosodic phrase by 
experiments.  
4.2.4 Other information 
From the statistical figures of the corpus, both 
prosodic word and phrase have limitation in 
length. The length of syntactic word (WLEN), 
the length of the sentence in character (SLENC) 
and word (SLENW) are considered as length 
features. In HMM-based methods, the chain of 
boundary labels in a sentence is supposed to 
conform to Markov assumption. And 
according to experience, it is less possible for 
two
 
boundaries with label B2  to locate very 
close to each other. Thus the label of previous 
boundaries (BTYPE) and the distances from 
them to current position are also possible 
features. 
4.3 Example Database 
All of the possible features are extracted from 
the corpus at each boundary to establish an 
example database. Table 2 shows parts of the 
example entries of two word boundaries in 
Figure 1. Each row is a type of feature. The 
row name has a format of feature name plus a 
number. The number indicates which word the 
feature comes from. And the range of the 
number is limited by a window size. For 
example, POS_0 denotes part-of-speech of the 
word just before the word boundary, POS_-1 
denotes that of the second word previous to the 
boundary and POS_1 denotes that of the word 
just after the boundary. The rest may be 
deduced by analogy. BTYPE_0 is the label of 
current boundary and also the target to be 
predicted.

4.4 Feature Selection Experiments 
Once the example database is established, we 
can begin to induce rules from it with rule 
learners. If all the features were used in one 
experiment, the feature space would get too 
large to learn rules quickly. Moreover we want 
to eliminate less significant features from the 
database. A series of comparative experiments 
is carried out to figure out the effective 
features. C4.5 learner is used to perform the 
learning task in the following experiments. 
4.4.1 Baseline experiment (No.1) 
Since POS features are widely used, a baseline 
experiment is performed with only two POS 
features that are POS_0 and POS_1. The POS 
tag set has total 30 tags from the tagger. 
4.4.2 POS window-size (No.2-9) 
The window size determines the number of 
words whose features are considered. Suppose 
the window size is L+R, which means the 
features of L words left to the boundary and R 
words right to it are used. We design 
experiments with the combination of different 
value of L and R to find the best window of 
POS features. The features in the window are 
denoted by POS{-L+1, R} in a range form. 
4.4.3 POS set (No.10-11) 
Experiments are conducted on three POS sets, 
which are BSET, LSET and CSET. BSET is the 
basic POS set from the tagger. LSET is an 
enlarged version of BSET, which includes the 
most frequent 100 words as independent tags. 
CSET is built with clustering technique. Each 
POS in the BSET is represented as a 
6-dimension vector, whose components are the 
probabilities of the boundary labels after and 
before that POS. Then these vectors are 
clustered into 10 groups. The window size 
used is 1+1. 
4.4.4 Other experiments (No.12-17) 
WORDLEN and SLEN are added into the 
baseline system to investigate the importance 
of length features in No.12 and 13. SYIF, 
TONE features of syllables around the 
boundary are considered in No.14. Previous 
boundary labels (BTYPE_-1, BTYPE_-2) are 
tested in the experiments No.15 and 16. 
WORD features are used in No.17 to find if 
there exist some words that have special 
prosodic effects.

Table 3: Results of feature selection (F0, F1, F2, Acc1, Acc2 are defined in section 3.2) 
 
4.5 Feature selection results 
The results of these experiments are listed in 
Table 3. From the evaluation figures in the 
table, we can draw the following conclusions 
on the effect of the features on prosodic phrase 
prediction: 
1) Part-of-speech is a basic and useful 
feature. A window size of 2+1 is already 
enough. Larger window size will greatly 
lengthen the time of training but make no 
significant improvement on the accuracy 
rate.  
2) The largest POS set LSET performs better 
than smaller ones like BSET and CSET. 
That?s because small POS sets lead to 
small feature space, which may be not big 
enough to distinguish the training 
examples.  
3) Length features are beneficial to prosodic 
phrase prediction.  
4) Phonetic features are less useful than what 
we think before.  
5) Former boundary information is also 
useful. When training, the former and 
latter boundary labels are both known, but 
when testing, exact former boundary 
labels do not exist. We can use the 
boundary labels that are already predicted 
to help make decision on current label. 
Although the error prediction of former 
labels may lead to error of current 
prediction, the result shows the accuracy 
rate is improved.  
6) WORD feature is not appropriate to use, 
since the using of it greatly enlarges the 
feature space and needs more training 
examples. 
4.6 C4.5 Experiments 
According to the feature selection results, we 
know some features are effective to prosodic 
phrase prediction but some are not. And the 
solely using of effective features doesn?t result 
in a high enough accuracy rate. In order to 
improve the prediction accuracy, we combine 
the effective features such as WLEN{-1, 1}, 
BTYPE{-1}, SLEN and POS{-1,1} in LSET tag 
set together to induce C4.5 rules.   
4.7 Examples of C4.5 Rules 
As mentioned above, rule systems have the 
advantage of simplicity and understandability. 
We examine the rules learned by C4.5 and find 
they certainly reflect the usage of prosodic 
structure in some sense. Here are some rules 
followed by example sentences with the 
current boundary labels in bold: 
1) if POS_1 == Z then BTYPE_0 = B0 
?/B0?/B1??/B0Z/B1|=?/B2 
2) if POS_1 == X then BTYPE_0 = B0 
:?/B0X/B1?W/B1??/B2 
3) if POS_0 == ? then BTYPE_0 = B0 
n$/B1?/B0S/B2 
4) if POS_0 == v && POS_1 == b then 
BTYPE_0 = B0 
?/B1?/B0b/B11998H/B2 
5) if POS_1 == c && WLEN_0 > 2 then 
BTYPE_0 = B2 
??/B2J/B1u?/B1?7/B2 
M/ B1J/B0?/B1?/B09/B2 
6) if POS_-1 == n && POS_0 ==  && 
BTYPE_-1 == B0 then BTYPE_0 = B2 
?/B0/B2??/B0X/B0??/B2 
 
Rule 1, 2 and 3 shows the special prosodic 
effect of functional words such as ?Z?, ?X?, 
???, which tends to adhere to prosodic words 
in the sentences. Rule 4 exemplifies that the 
syntactic structure ?Verb+b? usually acts as a 
prosodic word. Rule 5 concerns the 
conjunction word, the boundary before which 
would be B2 (prosodic phrase boundary) if the 
previous word had a length above 2. The B2 
boundary is thought to accentuate the word 
before the conjunction. Rule 6 deals with the 
structure ?Noun+?. We can see that these 
rules coincide with the experience of prosodic 
phrasing by human. 
4.8 TBL Experiments 
A general TBL toolkit (Grace and Radu, 2001) 
is used in our TBL experiments. The analysis 
on C4.5 rules casts lights on the design of the 
transformation rule templates of TBL. Since 
the same features as C4.5 learning are used in 
the rule templates, linguistic knowledge, which 
has been embodied by C4.5 rules, should also 
be captured by transformation rule templates. 
Suppose a C4.5 rule, ?if (POS_0 == n && 
POS_1 == u) then BTYPE_0 = B0?, has a high 
prediction accuracy, it is reasonable to make 
this rule as an instantiation of TBL rule 
templates. Table 4 lists some of the rule 
templates used in TBL experiments. 
 
POS_0 POS_1 => BTYPE_0 
POS_-1 POS_0 POS_1 => BTYPE_0 
BTYPE _0 POS_0 POS_1 => BTYPE_0 
BTYPE _0 POS_-1 POS_0 POS_1 => BTYPE_0 
POS_0 POS_1 WLEN_0 WLEN_1=> BTYPE_0 
WORD_0 POS_0 POS_1 => BTYPE_0 
WORD_0 POS_-1 POS_0 POS_1 => BTYPE_0 
BTYPE_0 WORD_0 POS_0 POS_1=>BTYPE_0 
...... 
Table 4: Rule templates for TBL 
 
 
The left part of a rule template is a list of 
features, and the right is the target, BTYPE_0. 
For example, ?POS_0 POS_1 => BTYPE_0?, 
which is a short form of ?if (POS_0 == X && 
POS_1 == Y) then BTYPE_0 = Z?, means if 
current POS were X and the next POS were Y, 
the boundary label would be Z. X, Y, Z are 
template variables. Let X=n Y=u Z=B0, the 
template is instantiated into the C4.5 rule 
above.  
Due to the mechanism of TBL rules, there 
exist rule templates like ?BTYPE_0 POS_0 
POS_1 => BTYPE_0?, in which the former 
BTYPE_0 is the label before applying the rule 
and the latter is after applying it. That?s 
actually what transformation means. When 
training, the initial boundary labels are all set 
to B1. At each step, the algorithm tries all the 
possible values for template variables to find 
an instantiated rule that can achieve the best 
score. When testing, the initial boundary labels 
are set the same way, and then transformation 
rules are applied one by one. 
5 Evaluation Results  
To evaluate the generalization ability of the 
acquired rules, 5-fold cross validation tests are 
executed on the corpus for both C4.5 and TBL.  
We reimplemented the RNN algorithm and 
POS bigram statistical model to predict 
prosodic word boundary on the same corpus 
for comparison. Since our corpus is not large 
enough for HMM training and the CART 
method is also decision-tree based as C4.5, we 
didn?t realize them in our experiments. The 
evaluation results are shown in Table 5. 
Both the C4.5 rules and the TBL rules 
outperform the RNN algorithm and POS 
bigram method because the overall accuracy 
rates Acc2 of the rule based methods are higher. 
TBL achieves comparable accuracy with C4.5 
induction, which demonstrates that the design 
of transformation rule templates is successful. 
Comparing Acc1 and Acc2 in Table 5, we 
discover that prosodic word boundaries can be 
more accurately predicted than prosodic phrase 
ones. It can be explained as follows. Prosodic 
word is the smallest prosodic unit in the 
prosodic hierarchy, which has more relation 
with the word level features such as POS, 
word length etc. Prosodic phrase is a larger 
prosodic unit less related to word level features, 
thus it cannot be predicted accurately using 
these features.

6 Conclusion and Future Work 
In this paper, we describe an effective 
approach to generate rules for Chinese 
prosodic phrase prediction. The main idea is to 
extract appropriate features from the linguistic 
information and to apply rule-learning 
algorithms to automatically induce rules for 
predicting prosodic boundary labels. C4.5 and 
TBL algorithms are experimented in our 
research. In order to find the most effective 
features, a series of feature selection 
experiments is conducted. The acquired rules 
achieve a best accuracy rate above 90% on test 
data and outperform the RNN and bigram 
based methods, which justifies rule-learning as 
an effective alternative to prosodic phrase 
prediction.  
But the problem of prosodic phrase 
prediction is far from solved. The best 
accuracy rate got by machine is still much 
lower than that by human. In our future work, 
the study on this problem will go more deep 
and wide. Other machine learning methods 
will be experimented and compared with C4.5 
and TBL. Features from deep syntactic, 
semantic or discourse information will be paid 
more attention to (Julia and Owen, 2001). And 
the speech corpus will be enlarged to cover 
more types of text and speaking styles.
