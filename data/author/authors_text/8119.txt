Abstract
This paper describes experiments in using
machine learning for relation disambiguation.
There have been succesfuld experiments in
combining machine learning and ontologies,
or light-weight ontologies such as WordNet,
for word sense disambiguation. However,
what we are trying to do, is to disambiguate
complex concepts consisting of two simpler
concepts and the relation that holds between
them. The motivation behind the approach is
to expand existing methods for content based
information retrieval. The experiments have
been performed using an annotated extract of
a corpus, consisting of prepositions surroun-
ded by noun phrases, where the prepositions
denote the relation we are trying disambigu-
ate. The results show an unexploited opportu-
nity of including prepositions and the relations
they denote, e.g. in content based information
retrieval.
1 Introduction
What we describe in this paper, which we refer to as re-
lation disambiguation, is in some sense similar to word
sense disambiguation. In traditional word sense disam-
biguation the objective is to associate a distinguishable
sense with a given word (Ide and Ve?ronis, 1998). It
is not a novel idea to use machine learning in con-
nection with traditional word sense disambiguation,
and as such it is not a novel idea to include some kind
of generalization of the concept that a word expres-
ses in the learning task either (Yarowsky, 1992). Ot-
her projects have used light-weight ontologies such as
WordNet in this kind of learning task (Voorhees, 1993;
Agirre and Martinez, 2001). What we believe is our
contribution with this work is the fact that we attempt to
learn complex concepts that consist of two simpler con-
cepts, and the relation that holds between them. Thus,
we start out with the knowledge that some relation
holds between two concepts, which we could express
as REL(concept1,concept2), and what we aim at being
able to do is to fill in a more specific relation type than
the generic REL, and get e.g. POF(concept1,concept2)
in the case where a preposition expresses a partitive re-
lation. This makes it e.g. possible to determine from
the sentence ?France is in Europe? that France is a part
of Europe. As in word sense disambiguation we here
presuppose a finite and minimal set of relations, which
is described in greater detail in section 2.
The ability to identify these complex structures in text,
can facilitate a more content based information retri-
eval as opposed to more traditional search engines,
where the information retrieval relies more or less
exclusively on keyword recognition. In the OntoQuery
project1, pertinent text segments are retrieved based on
the conceptual content of the search phrase as well as
the text segments (Andreasen et al, 2002; Andreasen
et al, 2004). Concepts are here identified through their
corresponding surface form (noun phrases), and map-
ped into the ontology. As a result, we come from a flat
structure in a text to a graph structure, which describes
the concepts that are referred to in a given text segment,
in relation to each other.
However, at the moment the ontology is strictly a
subsumption-based hierarchy and, further, only relati-
vely simple noun phrases are recognized and mapped
into the ontology. The work presented here expands
this scope by including other semantic relations be-
tween noun phrases. Our first experiments in this di-
rection have been an analysis of prepositions with sur-
rounding noun phrases (NPs). Our aim is to show that
there is an affinity between the ontological types of the
NP-heads and the relation that the preposition denotes,
which can be used to represent the text as a complex
semantic structure, as opposed to simply running text.
The approach to showing this has been to annotate a
corpus and use standard machine learning methods on
this corpus.
2 Semantic relations
The following account is based on the work of (Jensen
and Nilsson, 2006): Relations exist between entities re-
ferred to in discourse. They can exist at different synta-
ctic levels; across sentence boundaries as in example 1,
or within a sentence, a phrase or a word. The relations
1http://www.ontoquery.dk
72
can be denoted by different parts of speech, such as a
verb, a preposition or an adjective, or they can be impli-
citly present in compounds and genitive constructions
as in example 2.
Semantic relations are n-ary: In example 1 below the
verb form ?owns? denotes a binary relation between Pe-
ter and a dog, and in example 3, the verb form ?gave?
denotes a ternary relation between Peter, the dog and a
bone. In example 4 the preposition ?in? denotes a bi-
nary relation between the dog and the yard.
(1) Peter owns a dog. It is a German shepherd.
(2) Peter?s dog.
(3) Peter gave the dog a bone.
(4) The dog in the yard.
In the framework of this machine learning project, we
will only consider binary relations denoted by prepo-
sitions. A preposition, however, can be ambiguous in
regard to which relation it denotes. As an example, let
us consider the Danish preposition i (Eng: in): The sur-
face form i in ?A i B? can denote at least five different
relations between A and B:
1. A patient relation PNT; a relation where one of the
arguments? case role is patient, e.g. ??ndringer i
stofskiftet? (changes in the metabolism).
2. A locational relation LOC; a relation that denotes
the location/position of one of the arguments com-
pared to the other argument, e.g. ?skader i hjer-
temuskulaturen? (injuries in the heart muscle).
3. A temporal relation TMP; a relation that denotes
the placement in time of one of the arguments
compared to the other, e.g. ?mikrobiologien i
1800-tallet? (microbiology in the 19th century).
4. A property ascription relation CHR; a relation that
denotes a characterization relation between one of
the arguments and a property, e.g. ?antioxidanter
i renfremstillet form? (antioxidants in a pure form)
5. A ?with respect to? relation WRT; an underspeci-
fied relation that denotes an ?aboutness? relation
between the arguments, e.g. ?forskelle i saltindta-
gelsen? (differences in the salt intake) .
As presented above, the idea is to perform supervised
machine learning, that will take into account the sur-
face form of the preposition and the ontological type
of the heads of the surrounding noun phrases, and on
this basis be able to determine the relation that holds
between noun phrases surrounding a preposition in un-
seen text.
3 The corpus
In order to establish a training set, a small corpus of ap-
proximately 18,500 running words has been compiled
from texts from the domain of nutrition and afterwards
annotated with the ontological type of the head of the
noun phrases, and the semantic relation denoted by the
preposition 2.
All the text samples in this corpus derive from ?The
Danish National Encyclopedia? (Gyldendal, 2004), and
are thus not only limited domain-wise, but also of a
very specific text type which can be classified as expert-
to-non-expert. Thus, we cannot be certain that our re-
sults can be directly transferred to a larger or more ge-
neral domain, or to a different text type. This aspect
would have to be empirically determined.
3.1 Annotation
For the purpose of learning relations, 952 excerpts of
the form:
NP ? P ?NP (5)
have been extracted from the corpus and annotated with
information about part of speech, ontological type and
relation type for NP heads and prepositions, respecti-
vely. An example of the analyzed text excerpts are gi-
ven in table 1 on the following page, where each row
indicates a level of the analysis.
The POS-tagging and head extraction have been done
automatically, the ontological type assignation partly
automatically (ontology look-up) and partly manually
(for words that do not exist as instantiations of concepts
in the ontology). The relation annotation has been done
manually.
The tags used in the annotation on the three levels are:
POS-tags. Our tagger uses a subset of the PAROLE
tag set, consisting of 43 tags, see (Hansen, 2000),
which means that it is a low level POS tagging
with little morphosyntactic information. We only
use the tags in order to extract NPs and preposi-
tions, and thus do not need a more fine-grained
information level.
SIMPLE-tags. The tags used for the ontological type
annotation consist of abbreviations of the types in
the SIMPLE top ontology. The tag set consists of
151 tags.
Relation-tags. The tags used for the relation anno-
tation derive from a minimal set of relations that
have been used in earlier OntoQuery related work.
The set can be seen in table 2

lation type annotation was done by Dorte Haltrup Hansen,

Table 1: Example of the text excerpts analyzed in our experiments. Each row indicate a level of analysis
The manual relation annotation has been done by one
annotator for this initial project. The ideal situation
would be to have several annotators annotate the cor-
pus. If two or more people annotate the same corpus,
they are almost certain to disagree on some occasions.
This disagreement can have two sources: first it can be
due to cognitive differences. Two people subjected to
the same utterance are not guaranteed to perceive the
same content, or to perceive the content intended by
the producer of the utterance. Many factors are at play
here; cultural background, knowledge, memory, etc.
Secondly, it can be due to conceptual, lexical or syn-
tactic ambiguity in the utterance. We cannot remove
these sources of disagreement, but we can introduce
tools that make the annotation more consistent. By
using a finite and minimal realtion tag set and, further,
by introducing paraphrase tests, we hope to minimize
the risk of inter-annotator disagreement in a future an-
notation on a larger scale.
3.1.1 The ontological type annotation
As noted above, the ontological types used in the ex-
periments derive from the SIMPLE top ontology (Pe-
dersen, 1999; Lenci et al, 2000). The heads of the
phrases have been annotated with the lowest possible
node, i.e. ontological type, of the top ontology. In the
case of blodprop the annotation of ontological type is
?disease?, since ?disease? is the lowest node in the top
ontology in the path from thrombosis to the top. This is
illustrated in figure 1, which shows the path from blod-
prop (thrombosis) to the top level of SIMPLE.
Thus, for the purpose of this project, we only consi-
der one node for each concept: the lowest possible
node in the top ontology. Another approach would
be to consider the the full path to the top node, and
also including the path from the leaf node to the
lowest node in the top ontology. In the example depi-
cted in figure 1, the full path from trombosis to the
top node would be trombosis?cardiovascular disease?
disease?phenomenon?event?entity?top or trombosis?
cardiovascular disease?disease?agentive?top.
3.1.2 The set of relations
For the purpose of the manual relation annotation, we
needed to decide on a finite set of possible relations that
can be denoted by prepositions. This is a non-trivial
task, as it is almost impossible to foresee which rela-
tions prepositions can denote generally, and in the text
type at hand specifically, by introspection alone. The
method that we decided to use was the following: An
top
entity
eventagentive
phenomenon
disease
thrombosis

initial set of relations that have all been used in prior
OntoQuery-related work (Nilsson, 2001; Madsen et al,
2001; Madsen et al, 2000), were chosen as a point of
departure. The final set was found by annotating the
text segments using this set as the possible relation ty-
pes, and the relations that are actually manifested in
the data then form the final subset that was used as in-
put for a machine learning algorithm. The final subset
is shown in table 2.

3.2 Paraphrase tests
In order to ensure a consistent relation annotation, it
is necessary to develop a set of paraphrase tests that
can help the annotator determine which relation a given
preposition denotes in a given context. Some relations
are particularly difficult to intuitively keep apart from
closely related relations. One of these problematic re-
lation pairs is treated in some detail below.
For example locative and partitive relations can be diffi-
cult to keep apart, probably because they to some extent
are overlapping semantically. From a philosophical po-
int of view, an important question is ?when does an en-
tity become part of the entity it is located in??, but from
a practical point of view, we are interested in answe-
ring the question ?how can we decide if a given relation
a locative or partitive relation??.
In this paper we will only treat the latter question. A
tool that is useful for this purpose is the paraphrase test:
If we can paraphrase the text segment in question into
the phrasing the test prescribes, while preserving the
semantic content, we can conclude that the relation is a
possible relation for the given phrase.
3.2.1 Attribute Transportation Test
The two relations LOC and POF can be difficult to dif-
ferentiate, even when using paraphrase tests. There-
fore, an additional test that could be considered, is
Ruus? attribute transportation test (Ruus, 1995)3. In
the example ?The pages in the book?, the book gets
e.g. the attribute ?binding: {hardback | paperback}?
from cover, and the attribute ?paper grade:{bond | book
| bristol | newsprint}? from pages.
Figure 2: A graphical representation of the relation be-
tween book and pages
We cannot observe an attribute transport, neither from
the bird to the roof, nor the other way. This suggests
that it is possible to use the atrribute transportation test
in order to determine whether a given relation is a POF
or a LOC relation. Thus, we can now formulate the
following paraphrase test for POF:
POF: A consists e.g. of B and
A has the attribute X, from B.
3We will here ignore the question of direction of transport
4 Experiments
The annotation process generates af a feature space of
six dimensions, namely the lemmatized form of the two
heads of the noun phrases, the ontological types of the
heads, the preposition and the relation. In the corpus
there is a total of only 952 text segments. In general
the distribution of the data is highly skewed and spar-
seness is a serious problem. More than half of the in-
stances are of the relation type WRT or PNT, and the
rest of the instances are distributed among the remai-
ning 10 relations with only 14 instances scattered over
the tree smallest classes. This is illustrated in figure 3.
There are 332 different combinations of ontological ty-
pes where 197 are unique. There are 681 different he-
ads and 403 of them are unique, with all of them being
lemmatized.
Figure 3: An illustration of the distribution of the 12
possible relations.
Our assumption is that there is consistency in which
relations prepositions usually denote in particular con-
texts, and hence the learning algorithms should be able
to generalize well. We also assume that the addition
of the ontological types of the head of the NP, is the
most vital information in classifying the relation type,
at least in this case where data is sparse.
We have run the experiments with a Support Vector
Machine algorithm SMO (Keerthi et al, 2001) and
the prepositional rule learning algorithm JRip (Cohen,
1995). The former in order to get high precision, the
latter in order to get easily interpretable rules for later
analysis (see section 4.1). The experiments were run
using 10-fold-cross-validation, with a further partition
of the training set at each fold into a tuning and a trai-
ning set. The tuning set was used to optimize the pa-
rameter4 settings for each algorithm . The implemen-
tation of the algorithms that we used, was the WEKA
software package (Frank et al, 2005).
4For SMO the parameters where complexity, kernel used
and gamma for the RBF kernel. For JRip it was number of
folds used for growing and pruning, minimum number of in-
stances covered and number of optimization runs
75
The experiments were run on seven different combi-
nations of the feature space, ranging from using only
the heads to using both heads, preposition and ontolo-
gical types of the heads. This was done in order to get
insight into the importance of using ontological types
in the learning. The results of these experiments are
shown in table 3. The last column shows the precision
for a projected classifier (PC) in the cases where it out-
performs the trivial rejector. The projected classifier,
in this case, assigns the relation that is most common
for the corresponding input pair; e.g if the ontological
types are DIS/HUM, then the most common relation is
PNT. The trivial rejector, which assigns the most com-
mon relation, in this case WRT, to all the instances,
achieves a precision of 37.8%.

classifier on the seven different combinations of input
features. ?Lemma? here is short for lemmatized NP
head.
The following conclusions can be drawn from table 3.
The support vector machine algorithm produces a re-
sult which in all cases is better than the baseline, i.e. we
are able to produce a model that generalizes well over
the training instances compared to the projected clas-
sifier or the trivial rejector. This difference is not sta-
tistically significant at a confidence level of 0.95 when
only training on the surface form of prepositions.
A comparison of line 1?3 shows that training on onto-
logical types seems to be superior to using lemmatized
NP heads or prepositions, though the superiority is not
statistically significant when comparing to the lemma-
tized NP heads. When comparing line 4?7 the diffe-
rence between the results are not statistically signifi-
cant. This fact may owe to the data sparseness. Howe-
ver, comparing line 1 to line 6 or 7, shows that the im-
provement of adding the preposition and the lemma-
tized NP heads to the ontological types is statistically
significant.
In general, the results reveal an unexplored opportu-
nity to include ontological types and the relations that
prepositions denote in information retrieval. In the next
section, we will look more into the rules created by the
JRip algorithm from a linguistic point of view.
4.1 Analyzing the rules
In this section we will take a deeper look into the rules
produced by JRip on the data set with only ontological
types, since they are the most interesting in this context.
The JRip algorithm produced on average 21 rules. The
most general rule covering almost half of the instan-
ces is the default rule, that assigns all instances to the
WRT relation if no other rules apply. At the other end
of the spectrum, there are ten rules covering no more
than 34 instances, but with a precision of 100%. It is
futile to analyse these rules, since they cover the most
infrequent relations and hence may be overfitting the
data set. However, this seems not be the case with a
rule like ?if the ontotype of the first head is DISEASE
and and the ontotype of the second head is HUMAN
then the relation is PATIENT? covering an instance as
e.g. ?iron deficiency in females?.
The rule with the second highest coverage, and a fairly
low precision of around 66%, is the rule: ?if the on-
totype of the second head is BODY PART then the
relation type is LOCATIVE?. The rule covers instan-
ces as e.g. ?. . . thrombosis in the heart? but also incor-
rectly classifies all instances as LOCATIVE where the
relation type should be SOURCE. E.g. the sentence
?. . . iron absorbtion from the intestine?, which is in fact
a SOURCE relation, but is classified as LOCATIVE by
the rule.
One of the least surprising and most precise rules is:
?if the ontotype of the second head is TIME then the
relation type is TEMPORAL? covering an instance as
e.g. ?. . . diet for many months?. We would expect a
similar rule to be produced, if we had performed the
learning task on a general language corpus.
5 Conclusion and future work
Even though the experiments are in an early phase, the
results indicate that it is possible to analyse the seman-
tic relation a preposition denotes between two noun
phrases, by using machine learning and an annotated
corpus ? at least within the domain covered by the on-
tology. Future work will therefore include annotation
and investigation of a general language corpus. Also, a
more thorough examination of the corpus, more specifi-
cally an investigation of which relations or prepositions
that are most difficult to analyse. Also, we will experi-
ment with the amount of information that we train on,
not as we have already done by in- or excluding types
of information, but rather the extension of the infor-
mation: Could we predict the ontological type of one
of the arguments by looking at the other? Finally, an
explicit inclusion of the whole ontology in the learning
process is on the agenda, as proposed in section 3.1.1
on page 3, in the anticipation that the learner will pro-
duce an even better model.
