This paper introduces an approach to represent- 
ing the kinds of information that components 
in a natural language generation (NLG) sys- 
tem will need to communicate to one another. 
This information may be partial, may involve 
more than one level of analysis and may need 
to include information about the history of a 
derivation. We present a general representation 
scheme capable of handling these cases. In ad- 
dition, we make a proposal for organising inter- 
module communication i an NLG system by 
having a central server for this information. We 
have validated the approach by a reanalysis of 
an existing NLG system and through a full im- 
plementation of a runnable specification. 
1 In t roduct ion  
One of the distinctive properties of natural an- 
guage generation when compared with other 
language ngineering applications i that it has 
to take seriously the full range of linguistic rep- 
resentation, from concepts to morphology, or 
even phonetics. Any processing system is only 
as sophisticated as its input allows, so while a 
natural language understanding system might 
be judged primarily by its syntactic prowess, 
even if its attention to semantics, pragmatics 
and underlying conceptual analysis is minimal, 
a generation system is only as good as its deep- 
est linguistic representations. Moreover, any at- 
tempt to abstract away from individual gener- 
ation systems to a more generic architectural 
specification faces an even greater challenge: 
not only are complex linguistic representations 
required, able to support the dynamic evolu- 
tionary development of data during the gener-

ation process, but they must do so in a generic 
and flexible fashion. 
This paper describes a representation devel- 
oped to meet these requirements. It offers a 
formally well-defined eclarative representation 
language, which provides a framework for ex- 
pressing the complex and dynamic data require- 
ments of NLG systems. The approach supports 
different levels of representation, mixed repre- 
sentations that cut across levels, partial and 
shared structures and 'canned' representations, 
as well as dynamic relationships between data 
at different stages in processing. We are using 
the approach to develop a high level data model 
for NLG systems as part of a generic generation 
architecture called RAGS 1. 
The framework has been implemented in the 
form of a database server for modular genera- 
tion systems. As proof of concept of the frame- 
work, we have reimplemented an existing NLG 
system. The system we chose was the Caption 
Generation System (CGS) (Mittal et al, 1995; 
Mittal et al, 1998). The reimplementation in- 
volved defining the interfaces to the modules of 
CGS in terms of the RAGS representations and 
then implementing modules that had the requi- 
site input and output representations. 
Generation systems, especially end-to-end, 
applied generation systems, have, unsurpris- 
ingly, many things in common. Reiter (1994) 
proposed an analysis of such systems in terms 
of a simple three stage pipeline. More recently, 
the RAGS project attempted to repeat he anal-

ysis (Cahill et al, 1999a), but found that while 
most systems did implement a pipeline, they 
did not implement the same pipeline - different 
functionalities occurred in different places and 
different orders in different systems. In order 
to accommodate his result, we sought to de- 
velop an architecture that is more general than 
a simple pipeline, and thus supports the range 
of pipelines observed, as well as other more com- 
plex control regimes (see (Cahill et al, 1999a; 
Cahill et al, 1999b)). In this paper, we argue 
that supporting such an architecture requires 
careful consideration of the way data represen- 
tations interact and develop. Any formal frame- 
work for expressing the architecture must take 
account of this. 
2 The  representat iona l  requ i rements  
o f  generat ion  sys tems 
We noted in the introduction that generation 
systems have to deal with a range of linguis- 
tic information. It is natural, especially in the 
context of a generic architecture proposal, to 
model this breadth in terms of discrete layers 
of representation: (1999a) introduce layers such 
as conceptual, semantic, rhetorical, syntactic 
and document structure, but the precise demar- 
cation is not as important here as the princi- 
ple. The different kinds of information are typi- 
cally represented differently, and built up sepa- 
rately. However the layers are far from indepen- 
dent: objects at one layer are directly related to 
those at others, forming chains of dependency 
from conceptual through rhetorical and seman- 
tic structure to final syntactic and document re- 
alisation. This means that data resources, such 
as grammars and lexicons, and processing mod- 
ules in the system, are often defined in terms of 
mixed  data: structures that include informa- 
tion in more than one representation layer. So 
the ability to represent such mixed structures 
in a single formal framework is an important 
property of a generic data proposal. 
In addition, it is largely standard in gener- 
ation as elsewhere in language applications, to 
make extensive use of par t ia l  representations, 
often using a type system to capture grades of 
underspecification. An immediate corollary of 
providing support for partial structures is the 
notion that they may become further specified 
over time, that data structures evolve. If the 
framework seeks to avoid over-commitment to 
particular processing strategies it needs to pro- 
vide a way of representing such evolution ex- 
plicitly if required, rather than relying on de- 
structive modification of a structure. Related 
to this, it should provide explicit support for 
representing a l te rnat ive  specifications at any 
point. Finally, to fully support efficient pro- 
cessing across the range of applications, from 
the simple to the most complex, the represen- 
tation must allow for compact sharing of infor- 
mation in tang led  structures (two structures 
which share components). 
In addition to these direct requirements of the 
generation task itself, additional requirements 
arise from more general methodological consid- 
erations: we desire a representation that is for- 
mally well  def ined,  allows for theoretical rea-  
son ing about the data and performance of sys- 
tems, and supports control regimes from simple 
deterministic pipelines to complex parallel ar- 
chitectures. 
3 The  Representat ion  Scheme 
In this section, we present our proposal for a 
general representation scheme capable of cover- 
ing the above requirements. Our formulation is 
layered: the foundation is a simple, flexible, rig- 
orously defined graph representation formalism, 
on top of which we introduce notions of com- 
plex types and larger data structures and rela- 
tionships between them. This much is sufficient 
to capture the requirements just discussed. We 
suppose a yet higher level of specification could 
capture a more constraining data model but 
make no specific proposals about this here, how- 
ever the following sections use examples that do 
conform to such a higher level data model. 
The lowest level of the representation scheme 
is: 
? re lat iona l :  the basic data entity is x -~ y, 
an ar row representing a relation from ob- 
ject x to object y; 
? typed:  objects and arrows have an asso- 
ciated type system, so it is possible to de- 
fine classes and subclasses of objects and 
arrows. 
At the most fundamental level, this is more or 
less the whole definition. There is no commit- 
ment to what object or arrow types there are or 
120 
how they relate to each other. So a representa- 
tion allowed by the scheme consists of: 
? a set of objects, organised into types; 
? a set of binary relations, organised into 
types; 
? a set of arrows, each indicating that a rela- 
tion holds between one object and another 
object. 
Sets,  sequences  and  funct ions  
For the next level, we introduce more struc- 
ture in the type system to support sets, se- 
quences and functions. Objects are always 
atomic (though they can be of type set, se- 
quence or function) - it is not possible to make 
an object which actually is a set of two other 
objects (as you might with data structures in a 
computer program). To create a set, we intro- 
duce a set type for the object, and a set mem- 
bership arrow type (el), that links the set's el- 
ements to the set. Similarly, for a sequence, we 
introduce a sequence type and sequence mem- 
ber arrow types (1-el, 2-el, 3-el, . . .  ), and for a 
function, we have a complex type which spec- 
ifies the types of the arrows that make up the 
domain and the range of the function.

Figure 1: The partial semantic representation 
of "The second chart shows the number of days 
on the market" 
As an example, consider Figure 1, which 
shows a semantic representation (SemRep) from 
the CGS reimplementation. Here, the tree 
nodes correspond to objects, each labelled with 
its type. The root node is of type SemRep, and 
although it is not an explicit sequence type, we 
can see that it is a triple, as it has three sequence 
member arrows (with types 1-el, 2-el and 3-el). 
Its first arrow's target is an object of type DR 
(Discourse Referent). Its second represents a set 
of SemPred (Semantic Predicate) objects, and in 
this case there's just one, of type show. Its third 
element is a (partial) function, from Role arrow 
types (agent and affected are both subtypes of 
Role) to SemReps. (In this case, the SemReps 
have not yet been fully specified.) 
Local  and  non- loca l  a r rows  
The second extension to the basic representa- 
tion scheme is to distinguish two different ab- 
stract kinds of arrows - local and non-local. 
Fundamentally we are representing just a homo- 
geneous network of objects and relationships. In 
the example above we saw a network of arrows 
that we might want to view as a single data 
structure, and other major data types might 
similarly appear as networks. Additionally, we 
want to be able to express relationships between 
these larger 'structures' - between structures 
of the same type (alternative solutions, or re- 
vised versions) or of different ypes (semantic 
and syntactic for example). To capture these 
distinctions among arrows, we classify our ar- 
row types as local or non-local (we could do 
this in the type system itself, or leave it as an 
informal distinction). Local arrows are used to 
build up networks that we think of as single 
data structures. Non-local arrows express rela- 
tionships between such data structures. 
All the arrow types we saw above were local. 
Examples of non-local arrows might include: 
real ises These arro~vs link something more ab- 
stract to something less abstract hat re- 
alises it. Chains of realises arrows might 
lead from the original conceptual input to 
the generator through rhetorical, seman- 
tic and syntactic structures to the actual 
words that express the input. 
revises These arrows link a structure to an- 
other one of the same type, which is con- 
sidered to be a 'better' solution - perhaps 
because it is more instantiated. It is impor- 
tant to note that parts of larger structures 
can be revised without revising the entire 
structure. 
coreference These arrows link structures 
which are somehow "parallel" and which 
perhaps hare some substructure, i.e., tan- 
gled structures. For instance, document 
representations may be linked to rhetorical 
representations, either as whole isomorphic 
structures or at the level of individual con- 
stituents. 
121 
Notice that the representation scheme does 
not enforce any kind of well-formedness with 
respect o local and non-local arrows. In fact, 
although it is natural to think of a 'structure' as 
being a maximal network of local arrows with 
a single root object, there's no reason why this 
should be so - networks with multiple roots rep- 
resent tangled structures (structures that share 
content), networks that include non-local links 
might be mixed representations, containing in- 
formation of more than one sort. Such tech- 
niques might be useful for improving generator 
efficiency, or representing canned text or tem- 
plates, cf. (Calder et al, 1999). 
Par t ia l  and  Opaque s t ruc tures  
Partial structures are essential when a module 
needs to produce a skeleton of a representa- 
tion that it does not have the competence to 
completely fill out. For instance, lexical choice 
brings with it certain syntactic commitments, 
but in most NLG systems lexical choice occurs 
some time before a grammar is consulted to 
flesh out syntactic structure in detail. 
Figure 2: A partial structure 
By simply leaving out local arrows, we can 
represent a range of partial structures. Con- 
sider Fig. 2, where the triangles represent local 
structure, representing a sentence object and its 
component verb phrase. There is a link to a sub- 
ject noun phrase object, but none of the local 
arrows of the actual noun phrase are present. In 
subsequent processing this local structure might 
be filled in. This is possible as long as the noun 
phrase object has been declared to be of the 
right type. 
An opaque structure is one which has an in- 
complete derivational history - for example part 
of a syntactic structure without any correspond- 
ing semantic structure. Three possible reasons 
for having such structures are (a) to allow struc- 
ture to be introduced that the generator is not 
capable of producing directly, (b) to prevent he 
generator from interfering with the structure 
thus built (for example, by trying to modify an 
idiom in an inappropriate way), or (c) to im- 
prove generator efficiency by hiding detail that 
may lead to wasteful processing. An opaque 
structure is represented simply by the failure 
to include a rea l i ses  arrow to that structure. 
Such structures provide the basis for a gener- 
alised approach to "canning". 
4 Imp lementat ion  
There are many ways that modules in an 
NLG system could communicate information 
using the representation scheme just outlined. 
Here we describe a particularly general model 
of inter-module communication, based around 
modules communicating with a single cen- 
tralised repository of data called the whiteboard 
(Calder et al, 1999). A whiteboard is a cumu- 
lative typed relational blackboard: 
? t yped  and  re lat iona l :  because it is based 
on using the above representation scheme; 
? a b lackboard :  a control architec- 
ture and data store shared between 
processing modules; typically, modules 
add/change/remove objects in the data 
store, examine its contents, and/or ask to 
be notified of changes; 
? cumulat ive :  unlike standard blackboards, 
once data is added, it can't be changed or 
removed. So a structure is built incremen- 
tally by making successive copies of it (or of 
constituents of it) linked by rev ises  links 
(although actually, there's no constraint on 
the order in which they are built). 
A whiteboard allows modules to add ar- 
rows (typically forming networks through ar- 
rows sharing source or target objects), to in- 
spect the set of arrows looking for particular 
configurations of types, or to be informed when 
a particular type of arrow (or group of arrows) 
is added. 
The whiteboard is an active database server. 
This means that it runs as an independent pro- 
cess that other modules connect o by appropri- 
ate means. There are essentially three kinds of 
interaction that a module might have with the 
whiteboard server: 
? pub l i sh  - add an arrow or arrows to the 
whiteboard; 
122 
? query  - look for an arrow or arrows in the 
whiteboard; 
? wa i t  - register interest in an arrow or ar- 
rows appearing in the whiteboard. 
In both query and wait ,  arrows are specified 
by type, and with a hierarchical type system on 
objects and relations, this amounts to a pattern 
that matches arrows of subtypes as well. The 
wait  function allows the whiteboard to take the 
initiative in processing - if a module wai ts  on a 
query then the whiteboard waits until the query 
is satisfied, and then tells the module about it. 
So the module does not have to continuously 
scan the whiteboard for work to do, but can 
let the whiteboard tell it as soon as anything 
interesting happens. 
Typically a module will start up and regis- 
ter interest in the kind of arrow that represents 
the module's input data. It will then wait for 
the whiteboard to notify it of instances of that 
data (produced by other modules), and when- 
ever anything turns up, it processes it, adding 
its own results to the whiteboard. All the mod- 
ules do this asynchronously, and processing con- 
tinues until no module has any more work to 
do. This may sound like a recipe for confusion, 
but more standard pipelined behaviour is not 
much different. In fact, pipelining is exactly a 
data-based constraint - the second module in a 
pipeline does not start until the first one pro- 
duces its output. 
However, to be a strict pipeline, the first mod- 
ule must produce all of its output before the sec- 
ond one starts. This can be achieved simply by 
making the first module produce all its output 
at once, but sometimes that is not ideal - for ex- 
ample if the module is recursive and wishes to 
react to its own output. Alternative strategies 
include the use of markers in the whiteboard, 
so that modules can tell each other that they've 
finished processing (by adding a marker), or 
extending the whiteboard architecture itself so 
that modules can tell the whiteboard that they 
have finished processing, and other modules can 
wait for that to occur. 
5 Reconst ruct ion  o f  the  Capt ion  
Generat ion  System 
In order to prove this representation scheme 
in practice, we have implemented the white- 
board in Sicstus Prolog and used it to support 
data communications between modules in a re- 
construction of the Caption Generation System 
(Mittal et al, 1995). CGS is a system developed 
at the University of Pittsburgh, which takes in- 
put from the SAGE graphics presentation sys- 
tem (Roth et al, 1994) and generates captions 
for the graphics SAGE produces. We selected it 
for this effort because it appeared to be a fairly 
simple pipelined system, with modules perform- 
ing clearly defined linguistic tasks. As such, we 
thought it would be a good test case for our 
whiteboard specification. 
Although the CGS is organised as a pipeline, 
shown in Figure 3, the representations commu- 
nicated between the modules do not correspond 
to complete, separate instances of RAGS data- 
type representations. Instead, the representa- 
tions at the various levels accumulate along the 
pipeline or are revised in a way that does not 
correspond exactly to module boundaries. Fig- 
ure 3 gives a simple picture of how the different 
levels of representation build up. The labels for 
the RAGS representations refer to the following: 
? I = conceptual; 
? II -- semantic; 
? I I I  = rhetorical; 
? IV = document; 
? V = syntactic. 
For instance, some semantic (II) information is 
produced by the Text Planning module, and 
more work is done on this by Aggregation, but 
the semantic level of representation is not com- 
plete and final until the Referring Expression 
module has run. Also, for instance, at the 
point where the Ordering module has run, there 
are partially finished versions of three different 
types of representation. It is clear from this that 
the interfaces between the modules are more 
complex than could be accounted for by just re- 
ferring to the individual evels of representation 
of RAGS. The ability to express combinations of 
structures and partial structures was fundamen- 
tal to the reimplementation of CGS. We high- 
light below a few of the interesting places where 
these features were used.

5.1 Referr ing Express ion Generat ion  
In many NLG systems, (nominal) referring ex- 
pression generation is an operation that is in- 
voked at a relatively late stage, after the struc- 
ture of individual sentences i  fairly well speci- 
fied (at least semantically). However, referring 
expression generation eeds to go right back to 
the original world model/knowledge base to se- 
lect appropriate semantic ontent o realise a 
particular conceptual item as an NP (whereas 
all other content has been determined much ear- 
lier). In fact, there seems to be no place to 
put referring expression generation i a pipeline 
without there being some resulting awkward- 
ness. 
In RAGS, pointers to conceptual items can 
be included inside the first, "abstract", level of 
semantic representation (AbsSemRep), which is 
intended to correspond to an initial bundling of 
conceptual material under semantic predicates. 
On the other hand, the final, "concrete", level 
of semantic representation (SemRep) is more 
like a fully-fledged logical form and it is no 
longer appropriate for conceptual material to 
be included there. In the CGS reimplementa- 
tion, it is necessary for the Aggregation mod- 
ule to reason about the final high-level semantic 
representation f sentences, which means that 
this module must have access to "concrete" se- 
mantic representations. The Referring Expres- 
sion generation module does not run until later, 
which means that these representations cannot 
be complete. 
Our way around this was to ensure that the 
initial computation of concrete semantics from 
abstract semantics (done as part of Aggrega- 
tion here) left a record of the relationship by 
including realises arrows between correspond- 
ing structures. That computation could not be 
completed whenever it reached conceptual ma- 
terial - at that point it left a "hole" (an ob- 
ject with no further specification) in the con- 
crete semantic representation li ked back to the 
conceptual material. When referring expression 
was later invoked, by following the arrows in the 
124 
resulting mixed structure, it could tell exactly 
which conceptual entity needed to be referred 
to and where in the semantic structure the re- 
sulting semantic expression should be placed. 
Figure 4 shows the resulting arrangement for 
one example CGS sentence. The dashed lines 
indicate realises, i.e. non-local, arrows. 
5.2 Handling Centering Information 
The CGS Centering module reasons about the 
entities that will be referred to in each sentence 
and produces a representation which records the 
forward and backward-looking centers (Grosz et 
al., 1995). This representation is later used by 
the Referring Expression generation module in 
making pronominalisation decisions. This in- 
formation could potentially also be used in the 
Realisation module. 
Since Centering is not directly producing re- 
ferring expressions, its results have to sit around 
until they can actually be used. This posed 
a possible problem for us, because the RAGS 
framework does not provide a specific level of 
representation for Centering information and 
therefore seems on first sight unable to account 
for this information being communicated be- 
tween modules. The solution to the problem 
came when we realised that Centering informa- 
tion is in fact a kind of abstract syntactic in- 
formation. Although one might not expect ab- 
stract syntactic structure to be determined until 
the Realisation module (or perhaps lightly ear- 
lier), the CGS system starts this computation i
the Centering module. 
Thus in the reimplementation, the Centering 
module computes (very partial) abstract syn- 
tactic representations for the entities that will 
eventually be realised as NPs. These represen- 
tations basically just indicate the relevant Cen- 
tering statuses using syntactic features. Figure 
5 shows an example of the semantics for a typi- 
cal output sentence and the two partial abstract 
syntactic representations computed by the Cen- 
tering module for what will be the two NPs in 
that sentence 2. As before, dashed lines indicate 
realises arrows. Of course, given the discussion 
of the last section, the semantic representation 
objects that are the source of these arrows are in 
fact themselves linked back to conceptual enti- 
ties by being the destination of realises arrows 
2FVM = Feature Value Matrix. 
from them. 
When the Referring Expression generation 
module runs, it can recover the Centering infor- 
mation by inspecting the partial syntactic rep- 
resentations for the phrases it is supposed to 
generate. These partial representations are then 
further instantiated by, e.g., Lexical Choice at 
later stages of the pipeline. 
6 Conc lus ion  
The representation scheme we have proposed 
here is designed specifically to support he re- 
quirements of the current state-of-the-art NLG 
systems, and our pilot implementation demon- 
strates the practical applicability of the pro- 
posal. Tangled, partial and mixed structures 
are of obvious utility to any system with a flex- 
ible control strategy and we have shown here 
how the proposed representation scheme sup- 
ports them. By recording the derivational his- 
tory of computations, it also supports decisions 
which partly depend on earlier stages of the 
generation process (e.g., possibly, lexical choice) 
and revision-based architectures which typically 
make use of such information. We have shown 
how the representation scheme might be the ba- 
sis for an inter-module communication model, 
the whiteboard, which supports a wide range of 
processing strategies that require the represen- 
tation of complex and evolving data dependem 
cies. The fact that the whiteboard is cumula- 
tive, or monotonic in a logical sense, means that 
the whiteboard also supports reasoning about 
the behaviour of NLG systems implemented in 
terms of it. This is something that we would 
like to exploit directly in the future. 
The reimplementation f the CGS system 
in the RAGS framework was a challenge to 
the framework because it was a system that 
had already been developed completely inde- 
pendently. Even though we did not always un- 
derstand the detailed motivation for the struc- 
ture of CGS being as it was, within a short time 
we reconstructed a working system with mod- 
ules that corresponded closely to the original 
CGS modules. The representation scheme we 
have proposed here was a key ingredient in giv- 
ing us the flexibility to achieve the particular 
processing scheme used by CGS whilst remain- 
ing faithful to the (relatively simple) RAGS 
data model.

Figure 5: Arrangement of centering information for the output sentence above 
The representation scheme is useful in situa- 
tions where modules need to be defined and im- 
plemented to work with other modules, possibly 
developed by different people. In such cases, the 
representation scheme we propose permits pre- 
cise definition of the interfaces of the modules, 
even where they are not restricted to a single 
'level' of representation. Even though the con- 
trol structure of CGS is quite simple, we found 
that the use of a centralised whiteboard was use- 
ful in helping us to agree on interfaces and on 
the exact contribution that each module should 
be making. Ultimately, it is hoped that the use 
of a scheme of this type will permit much more 
widespread 'plug-and-play' among members of 
the NLG community.

1 Introduction 
The RAGS project ~ aims to define a reference ar- 
chitecture for natural anguage generation systems. 
Currently the major part of this architecture consists 
of a set of datatype definitions for specifying the 
input and output formats for modules within NLG 
systems. The intention is that such representations 
can be used to assist in reusability of components 
of NLG systems. System components that adhere 
to these representations, or use a format hat can be 
translated into such representations relatively eas- 
ily, can then, in principle, be substituted into other 
systems. Also, individual components could be de- 
veloped without the need for a complete system if 
datasets, based on the representations, were made 
available. 
In this paper we describe an attempt to reinterpret 
an existing NLG system in terms of the RAGS data 
definitions. The point of this exercise was to lem-n: 
1. Whether these data structures were sufficient 
to describe the input and output functionality 
of an existing, independently developed, ap- 
3. Whether studying the system would generate 
good ideas about possible reusable generation 
modules that could be developed. 
In this exercise it was important o choose a sys- 
tem that had been developed by people outside the 
RAGS project. Equally, it was important o have 
sufficient clear information about the system in the 
available literature, and/or by means of personal 
contact with the developers. The system chosen was 
the Caption Generation System (Mittal et al, 1995; 
Mittal et al, 1998) 3. This system was chosen be- 
cause, as well as fulfilling the criteria above, it ap- 
peared to be a relatively simple pipeline, thus avoid- 
ing complex control issues, with individual modules 
performing the varied linguistic tasks that the RAGS 
data structures had been designed to handle. 
The reinterpretation exercise took the form of 
coming up with an account of how the interfaces 
to the CGS modules corresponded to the RAGS 
model and reimplementing a working version of 
each module (apart from Text Planning and Realisa- 
tion) which was tested to ensure that, given appro- 
priate input, its output was correct (i.e. conforming 
to the global account) on key examples. Naturally, 
given the scope of this exercise, we had to gloss over 
some interesting implementational issues. The aim 
was not to produce a complete system or a system 
as good as CGS, but merely to demonstrate hat the 
broad functionality of the system could be repro- 
plied 2 NLG system.

2 The RAGS datatypes  
The RAGS project initially set out to develop a ref- 
erence architecture based on the three-stage pipeline 
suggested by Reiter (Reiter, 1994). However, a 
trees or Abstract Semantic Representations at the 
leaves. 
Rhetorical Abstract Rhetorical Representations 
are viewed as descriptions of sets of possible 
Rhetorical Representations. Each one may be trans- 
detailed analysis of existing applied NLG systems formed into some subset of the possible Rhetori- 
(Cahill and Reape~_~ l:998}:suggested~,that~ttch.an~ ar -~: ~<.eaLReprese, ntations by,,means ~ofa,set..o_f~.petmitted 
chitecture was not specific enough and not closely transformations, e.g. reversing the order of nucleus 
enough adhered to by the majority of the systems 
surveyed for this to be used as the basis of the archi- 
tecture. 
The abstract functionality of a generation system 
can be specified without specific reference to pro- 
cessing. The RAGS approach to this is to develop a 
data model, that is, to define the functional modules 
entirely in terms of the datatypes they manipulate 
and the operations they can perform on them. On 
top of such a model, more specific process models 
can be created in terms of constraints on the order 
and level of instantiation of different ypes of data in 
the data model. A 'rational reconstnaction' of some 
pipeline model might then be produced, but other 
process models would also be possible. 
The RAGS levels of representation are as fol- 
lows4: 
Conceptual The conceptual level of representa- 
tion is defined only indirectly through an API via 
which a knowledge base (providing the content 
from which generation takes place) can be viewed 
as if it were defined in a simple KL-ONE (Brach- 
man and Schmolze, 1985) like system. 
Abstract Semantic Abstract semantic representa- 
tions are the first level at which semantic predicates 
are associated with arguments. At this level, seman- 
tic predicates and roles are those used in the API to 
query the knowledge base and arguments are knowl- 
edge base entities. 
Semantic (Concrete) semantic representations 
provide a complete notation for "logical forms" 
where there is no longer any reference to ,the knowl- 
edge base. The representations are based on sys- 
tems such as SPL (Kasper, 1989) and DRT (Kamp 
and Reyle, 1993).

al., 1999) and at the RAGS project web site:

and satellite or changing the rhetorical relation to 
one within a permitted set. 
Abstract Document Document structure defines 
the linear ordering of the constituents of the Rhetor- 
ical Representation with a POSITION feature, as 
well as two other features, TEXT-LEVEL, which 
takes values such as paragraph or sentence; and 
LAYOUT, which takes values such as wrapped-text 
and vertical list. It takes the form of a tree, usu- 
ally, but not necessarily, isomorphic to the Rhetor- 
ical Representation a d linked to it, but with these 
three features at the nodes instead of rhetorical rela- 
tions. 
Abstract Syntactic Abstract Syntactic Represen- 
tations capture high-level aspects of syntactic struc- 
ture in terms of notions such as lexical head, speci- 
fiers, modifiers and complements. This level of rep- 
resentation is compatible with approaches such as 
LFG f-structure, HPSG and Meteer's Text Structure. 
3 Partial and Mixed Representations 
For all of the RAGS levels partial representations 
are possible. Without this, it is not possible for a 
module to pass any result to another until that re- 
sult is completely determined, and this would im- 
pose an unwanted bias towards simple pipeline ar- 
chitectures into the model. There are many cases 
in NLG where a representation is built collabora- 
tively by several modules. For instance, many sys- 
tems have a referring expression generation module 
whose task is to complete a semantic representation 
which lacks those structures which will be realised 
as NPs. Such a functionality cannot be described 
unless partially complete semantic representations 
can be communicated. 
In addition, mixed representations are possible, 
where (possibly partial) representations at several 
levels are combined with explicit links between the 
elements. Many NLG modules have to be sensi- 
70 
tive to a number of levels at once (consider, for 
.......... instance, -aggregatiomxeferring,expmssion.,genera- 
tion and lexicalisation, all of which need to take 
into account rhetorical, semantic and syntactic on- 
straints). The input to most reusable realisation sys- 
tems is also best viewed as a mixture of semantic 
and abstract syntactic information. 
The extra flexibility of having partial and mixed 
representations turned out to be vital in the recon- 
struction of the CGS system. (Mellish et al, 2000). 
4 The CGS system 
The Caption Generation System (CGS) generates 
explanatory captions of graphical presentations (2- 
D charts and graphs). Its architecture is a pipeline 
with several modules, shown in the left hand part of 
Figure 1. An example of a diagram and its accom- 
panying text are given in Figure 2. The propositions 
are numbered for ease of reference throughout the 
paper. 
The input to CGS is a picture representation 
(graphical elements and its mapping from the data 
set) generated by SAGE plus its complexity metric. 
The text planning module (Moore and Paris (1993)) 
plans an explanation i  terms of high level discourse 
goals. The output of the planner is a partially or- 
dered plan with speech-acts as leaves. 
The ordering module receives as input the dis- 
course plan with links specifying the ordering re- 
lations between sub-trees and specifies an order for 
them based on heuristics uch as that the description 
should be done from left to right in the visual space. 
The aggregation module "only conjoins pairs of 
contiguous propositions about the same grapheme 
type 5 in the same space" (Mittai et al, 1999) and 
inserts cue phrases compatible with the propositions 
e o ( .=., "whereas" for contrastive ones). The internal 
order of the sentence constituents i determined by 
the centering module using an extension of the cen- 
tering theory of Grosz and colleagues (Grosz et al, 
1995). 
The referring expression module uses Date and 
Reiter's (Dale and Reiter, 1995) algorithm to con- 
struct the set of attributes that can uniquely identify 
a referent. There are'two, situations where the text 
planning module helps specifically in the generation 
of referring expressions: (1) when the complexity 
for expressing a graphic demands an example and 
5"Graphemes are the basic building blocks for constructing 
pictures. Marks, text, lines and bars are some of the different 
grapheme classes available in SAGE." (IVlittal et al, 1999).

it signals this both to SAGE (for highlighting the 
corresponding grapheme) and to the rest of the text 
generation modules; and (2) when in a specific sit- 
uation the referring algorithm would need several 
interactions for detecting that an entity is unique in 
? a certain visual space and.the planning could detect 
it in the construction of the description of this space. 
When this occurs, the text planner "circumvents he 
problem for the:.referring ,expression :module at the 
planning stage itself, processing the speech-acts ap- 
propriately to avoid this situation completely". 
After lexicalisation, which adds lexeme and ma- 
jor category information, the resulting functional 
descriptions are passed to the FUF/SURGE realiser 
that generates texts like the caption of Figure 2.

5 Reinterpretat ion f  CGS in RAGS 
Our reinterpretation f the CGS system defines the 
interfaces between the modules of CGS in terms 
of the RAGS data structures discussed above. In 
this section we discuss the input and output inter- 
faces for each CGS module in turn as well as any 
problems we encountered in mapping the structures 
into RAGS structures. Figure 1 shows the incre- 
mental build-up of the RAGS data levels across 
the pipeline. Here we have collapsed the Abstract 
Rhetorical and Rhetorical and the Abstract Seman- 
tic and Semantic. It is-interesting to note that the 
build up of levels of representation does not tend to 
correspond exactly with module boundaries. 
One of the major issues we faced in' our reinter- 
pretation was where to produce representations (or
partial representations) whose emergence was not 
defined clearly in the descriptions of CGS. For in- 
stance, many decisions about document structure 
are made only implicitly by the system. In most 
cases we have opted to produce all types of repre- 
sentations at the earliest point where they can con- 
ceivably have any content. This means, for instance, 
that our reimplementation assumes an (unimple- 
mented) text planner which produces an Abstract 
Rhetorical Representation with Abstract Semantic 
leaves and an Abstract Document Representation. 
Text Planner The input to the Longbow text plan- 
ner discussed in section 4 above is a representation 
of a picture in SAGE format (which has been an- 
notated to indicate the types of complexity of each 
grapheme) together with a goal, which can typi- 
cally be interpreted as "describe". It outputs an es- 
sentially fiat sequence of plan operators, each of 
which corresponds in the output? text .to .a.speech 
act. In our reinterpretation, we have assumed that 
this fiat structure needs to be translated into an Ab- 
stract Rhetorical Representation with (at least) min- 
imal structure. Such a structure is implicit in the 
plan steps, and our interpretation f the rhetorical 
structure for the example text corresponds closely to 
that of the post-processing trace produced by CGS.

However, we are still not entirely sure 
exactly CGS creates this structure, so 
posed it at the very beginning, onto the 
text planner. 
Already at this stage it is necessary 
about where 
we have im- 
output of the 
to make use 
of mixed RAGS representations. As well as this 
Abstract Rhetorical Representation, the text planner 
has to produce an Abstract Document Representa- 
tion, linked to the Abstract Rhetorical Representa- 
tion. This is already partially ordered - although the 
exact value of POSITION features cannot be speci- 
fied at this stage, the document tree is constructed 
so that propositions are already grouped together. 
In addition, we make explicit certain default infor- 
mation that the CGS leaves implicit at this stage, 
namely, that the LAYOUT feature is always wrapped 
text and that the TEXT-LEVEL feature of the top 
node is always paragraph. 
Ordering The ordering module takes the Abstract 
Document Representation a d the Abstract Rhetor- 
ical Representation as input and outputs an Abstract 
Document Representation with the POSITION fea- 
ture 's  value filled,for all :the nodes, .That is, it fixes. ? 
the linear order of the final output of the speech acts. 
In our example, the ordering is changed so that steps 
7 and 8 are promoted to appear before 3, 4, 5 and 6. 
The resulting structure is shown in figure 36 . 
6In this and the.following diagrams, objects are represented 
by circles with (labelled) arrows indicating the relations be-- 
Aggregation Although aggregation might seem 
like a self-contained process within NLG, in prac- 
tice it can make changes at a number of levels of 
representation a d indeed it may be the last opera- 
tion that has an effect on several levels. The aggre- 
gation module in our reinterpretation thus has the fi- 
nal responsibility to convert an Abstract Rhetorical 
Representation with Abstract Semantic Represen- 
tation leaves into a Rhetorical Representation with 
Semantic Representation leaves. The new Rhetori- 
cal Representation may be different from before as 
a result of speech acts being aggregated but whether 
different or not, it can now be considered final as 
it will no longer be changed by the system. The 
resulting Semantic Representations are no longer 
Abstract because further structure may have been 
determined for arguments to predicates. On the 
other hand, referring expressions have not yet been 
generated and so the (Concrete) Semantic Repre- 
sentations cannot be complete. The reconstruc- 
,.tion createspartia.i Semantic Representations with 
"holes" where the referring expressions (Semantic 
Representations) will be inserted. These "holes" are 
linked back to the knowledge base entities tfiat they 
correspond to. 
Because Aggregation affects text levels, it also af- 
fects the Abstract Document Representation, which 
has its TEXT-LEVEL feature's values all filled at this 
tween them. Dashed arrows indicate links between different 
levels of representation.

point. It may also need to change the structure 
of the Abstract Document Representation, for in- 
stance, adding in a node for a sentence above two, 
now aggregated, clause nodes. 
Centering Because Centering comes before Re- 
ferring Expression generation and Realisation, all it 
can do is establish constraints that must be heeded 
by the later modules. At one stage, it seemed as if 
this required communicating a kind of information 
that was not covered by the RAGS datatypes. How- 
ever, the fact that an NP corresponds (or not) to a 
center of some kind can be regarded as a kind of 
abstract syntactic information. The reconstruction 
therefore has the centering module building a partial 
(unconnected) Abstract Syntactic representation for 
each Semantic Representation that will be realised 
as an NP, inserting a feature that specifies whether 
it constitutes a forward- or backward-facing cen- 
ter, approximately following Grosz et al(Grosz et 
al., 1995). This information is used to determine 
whether active or passive voice will be used. An 
example of such a partial Abstract Syntactic Repre- 
sentation is given in Figure 4. 
Referring Expression In our reconstruction of 
the CGS system, we have deviated from reproduc- 
ing the exact functionality for the referring expres- 
sion module and part of the lexical choice module. 
In the CGS system, the referring expression module 
computes association lists which can be used by the 
lexical choice module to construct referring expres- 
sions suitable for realisation. In our reconstruction, 
however, the referring expression module directly 
computes the Semantic Representations of referring 
expressions. 
We believe that this is a good example of a 
case where developing a system with the RAGS 
data structures in mind simplifies the task. There 
are undoubtedly many different ways in which the 
same results could be achieved, and there are many 
(linguistic, engineering etc.) reasons for choosing 
one rather than another. Our particular choice is 
driven by the desire for conceptual simplicity, rather 
than any strictly linguistic or computational motiva- 
tions. We considered for each module which RAGS 
level(s) it contributed to and then implemented it to 
manipulate that (or those) level(s). In this case, that 
meant a much more conceptually simple module 
which just adds information to the Semantic Rep- 
resentations. 
Lexical Choice In CGS, this module performs a 
range of tasks, including what we might call the 
later.stages of_referring expression generation and 
lexical choice, before converting the plan leaves 
into FDs (Functional Descriptions), which serve as 
the input to the FUF/SURGE module. In the re- 
construction, on the other hand, referring expres- 
sions have already been computed and the Rhetor- 
ical Representation, with its now complete Seman- 
tic Representations, needs to be "lexicalised" and 
74

Figure 5: Combined Semantic and Abstract Syntactic Representation 
translated into FUF/SURGE format. Lexicalisa- 
tion in our terms involves adding the lexeme and 
major category information to the Abstract Syntac- 
tic Representations for the semantic predicates in 
each Semantic Representation. The FUF/SURGE 
input format was regarded as a combination of Se- 
mantic and Abstract Syntactic information, and this 
can easily be produced from the RAGS representa- 
tions. The combined Semantic and Abstract Syn- 
tactic Representations for the plan step "These two 
charts present information about house sales from 
data set ts-1740" is shown in Figure 5. The boxes 
indicate suppressed subgraphs of the lexemes cor- 
responding to the word in the boxes and triangles 
indicate suppressed subgraphs of the two adjuncts. 
6 Conclusions 
The reconstruction of CGS has taken the form of 
working out in detail the RAGS representations 
passed between modules at each stage for a set 
of key examples and reimplementing the modules 
(apart from the Planner and Realiser) in a way that 
correctly reproduces these representations. The ac- 
tual implementation used an incrementally growing 
data store for the RAGS representations which the 
modules accessed in turn, though the passing of data 
could also have been achieved in other ways. 
The fact that the reconstruction has been success- 
ful indicates that the RAGS architecture is broadly 
adequate to redescribe this NLG system: 
? No changes to the existing levels of represen- 
tation were needed, though it was necessary to 
make extensive use of partial and mixed repre- 
sentations. 
o No new levels of representation needed to be 
introduced to capture the inter-module com- 
munication of the system. 
o All of the levels of representation_apart from 
the Conceptual level were used significantly in
the reconstruction. 
In some ways, i t  is unfortunate that none of the 
inter-module interfaces of CGS turned out to use a 
single level of RAGS representation. Given the mo- 
tivation for partial and mixed representations above, 
however, this did not really come as a surprise. It 
may well be that any really useful reusable modules 
for NLG will have to have this complexity. 
75 
In spite of the successful testing of the RAGS data 
model, somedifficulties were encountered: 
* It was difficult to determine the exact nature 
of the representations produced by the Planner, 
though in the end we were able to develop a 
system to automatically translate these into a 
format we could deal with. 
o Although the theoretical model o f  CGS has a 
simple modular structure, in practice the mod- 
ules are very tightly inte-gr~ifed and making-the " 
exact interfaces explicit was not always easy. 
? Referring expression generation requires fur- 
ther access to the "knowledge base" holding 
information about he graphic to be produced. 
This knowledge was only available via interac- 
tions with SAGE, and so it was not possible to 
determine whether the RAGS view of Concep- 
tual Representations was applicable. Our own 
implementation f referring expression gener- 
ation had to work around this problem in a non- 
portable way. 
? It became clear that there are many housekeep- 
ing tasks that an NLG system must perform 
following Lexical Choice in order for the final 
Semantic and Abstract Syntactic Representa- 
tions to be appropriate for direct input to a re- 
alisation system such as FUF. 
o The fact that the system was driving 
FUF/SURGE seems to have had a signif- 
icant effect on the internal representations 
used by CGS. The reconstruction echoed this 
and as a result may not be as general as could 
be desired. 
? Even though CGS only performs imple types 
of Aggregation, it is clear that this is a critical 
module for determining the final form of sev- 
eral levels of representation. 
The division of CGS into modules is different from 
that used in any NLG systems we have previously 
worked on and so has been a useful stimulus to think 
about ways in which reusable modules can be de- 
signed. We envisage reusmgat  least,the reimple- 
mentation of the Centering module in our further 
work.
