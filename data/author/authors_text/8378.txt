Abstract
We address appropriate user modeling in
order to generate cooperative responses to
each user in spoken dialogue systems. Un-
like previous studies that focus on user?s
knowledge or typical kinds of users, the
user model we propose is more compre-
hensive. Specifically, we set up three di-
mensions of user models: skill level to
the system, knowledge level on the tar-
get domain and the degree of hastiness.
Moreover, the models are automatically
derived by decision tree learning using
real dialogue data collected by the sys-
tem. We obtained reasonable classifica-
tion accuracy for all dimensions. Dia-
logue strategies based on the user model-
ing are implemented in Kyoto city bus in-
formation system that has been developed
at our laboratory. Experimental evalua-
tion shows that the cooperative responses
adaptive to individual users serve as good
guidance for novice users without increas-
ing the dialogue duration for skilled users.
1 Introduction
A spoken dialogue system is one of the promising
applications of the speech recognition and natural
language understanding technologies. A typical task
of spoken dialogue systems is database retrieval.
Some IVR (interactive voice response) systems us-
ing the speech recognition technology are being put
into practical use as its simplest form. According to
the spread of cellular phones, spoken dialogue sys-
tems via telephone enable us to obtain information
from various places without any other special appa-
ratuses.
However, the speech interface involves two in-
evitable problems: one is speech recognition er-
rors, and the other is that much information can-
not be conveyed at once in speech communications.
Therefore, the dialogue strategies, which determine
when to make guidance and what the system should
tell to the user, are the essential factors. To cope
with speech recognition errors, several confirma-
tion strategies have been proposed: confirmation
management methods based on confidence measures
of speech recognition results (Komatani and Kawa-
hara, 2000; Hazen et al, 2000) and implicit con-
firmation that includes previous recognition results
into system?s prompts (Sturm et al, 1999). In terms
of determining what to say to the user, several stud-
ies have been done not only to output answers cor-
responding to user?s questions but also to generate
cooperative responses (Sadek, 1999). Furthermore,
methods have also been proposed to change the di-
alogue initiative based on various cues (Litman and
Pan, 2000; Chu-Carroll, 2000; Lamel et al, 1999).
Nevertheless, whether a particular response is co-
operative or not depends on individual user?s char-
acteristics. For example, when a user says nothing,
the appropriate response should be different whether
he/she is not accustomed to using the spoken dia-
logue systems or he/she does not know much about
the target domain. Unless we detect the cause of the
silence, the system may fall into the same situation
repeatedly.
In order to adapt the system?s behavior to individ-
ual users, it is necessary to model the user?s patterns
(Kass and Finin, 1988). Most of conventional stud-
ies on user models have focused on the knowledge
of users. Others tried to infer and utilize user?s goals
to generate responses adapted to the user (van Beek,
1987; Paris, 1988). Elzer et al (2000) proposed a
method to generate adaptive suggestions according
to users? preferences.
However, these studies depend on knowledge of
the target domain greatly, and therefore the user
models need to be deliberated manually to be ap-
plied to new domains. Moreover, they assumed that
the input is text only, which does not contain errors.
On the other hand, spoken utterances include various
information such as the interval between utterances,
the presence of barge-in and so on, which can be
utilized to judge the user?s character. These features
also possess generality in spoken dialogue systems
because they are not dependent on domain-specific
knowledge.
We propose more comprehensive user models to
generate user-adapted responses in spoken dialogue
systems taking account of all available information
specific to spoken dialogue. The models change
both the dialogue initiative and the generated re-
sponse. In (Eckert et al, 1997), typical users? be-
haviors are defined to evaluate spoken dialogue sys-
tems by simulation, and stereotypes of users are as-
sumed such as patient, submissive and experienced.
We introduce user models not for defining users? be-
haviors beforehand, but for detecting users? patterns
in real-time interaction.
We define three dimensions in the user models:
?skill level to the system?, ?knowledge level on the
target domain? and ?degree of hastiness?. The for-
mer two are related to the strategies in manage-
ment of the initiative and the response generation.
These two enable the system to adaptively gener-
ate dialogue management information and domain-
specific information, respectively. The last one is
used to manage the situation when users are in hurry.
Namely, it controls generation of the additive con-
tents based on the former two user models. Handling
such a situation becomes more crucial in speech
communications using cellular phones.
The user models are trained by decision tree
Sys: Please tell me your current bus stop, your destination
or the specific bus route.
User: Shijo-Kawaramachi.
Sys: Do you take a bus from Shijo-Kawaramachi?
User: Yes.
Sys: Where will you get off the bus?
User: Arashiyama.
Sys: Do you go from Shijo-Kawaramachi to Arashiyama?
User: Yes.
Sys: Bus number 11 bound for Arashiyama has departed
Sanjo-Keihanmae, two bus stops away.
Figure 1: Example dialogue of the bus system
learning algorithm using real data collected from the
Kyoto city bus information system. Then, we imple-
ment the user models and adaptive dialogue strate-
gies on the system and evaluate them using data col-
lected with 20 novice users.
2 Kyoto City Bus Information System
We have developed the Kyoto City Bus Information
System, which locates the bus a user wants to take,
and tells him/her how long it will take before its
arrival. The system can be accessed via telephone
including cellular phones1. From any places, users
can easily get the bus information that changes ev-
ery minute. Users are requested to input the bus stop
to get on, the destination, or the bus route number
by speech, and get the corresponding bus informa-
tion. The bus stops can be specified by the name of
famous places or public facilities nearby. Figure 1
shows a simple example of the dialogue.
Figure 2 shows an overview of the system.
The system operates by generating VoiceXML
scripts dynamically. The real-time bus information
database is provided on the Web, and can be ac-
cessed via Internet. Then, we explain the modules
in the following.
VWS (Voice Web Server)
The Voice Web Server drives the speech recog-
nition engine and the TTS (Text-To-Speech)
module according to the specifications by the
generated VoiceXML.

lary, which are defined by VoiceXML at each

Dialogue Manager
The dialogue manager generates response sen-
tences based on speech recognition results (bus
stop names or a route number) received from
the VWS. If sufficient information to locate a
bus is obtained, it retrieves the corresponding
information from the real-time bus information
database.
VoiceXML Generator
This module dynamically generates VoiceXML
files that contain response sentences and spec-
ifications of speech recognition grammars,
which are given by the dialogue manager.
User Model Identifier
This module classifies user?s characters based
on the user models using features specific to
spoken dialogue as well as semantic attributes.
The obtained user profiles are sent to the dia-
logue manager, and are utilized in the dialogue
management and response generation.
3 Response Generation using User Models
3.1 Classification of User Models
We define three dimensions as user models listed be-
low.
 Skill level to the system
 Knowledge level on the target domain
 Degree of hastiness
Skill Level to the System
Since spoken dialogue systems are not
widespread yet, there arises a difference in the
skill level of users in operating the systems. It
is desirable that the system changes its behavior
including response generation and initiative man-
agement in accordance with the skill level of the
user. In conventional systems, a system-initiated
guidance has been invoked on the spur of the
moment either when the user says nothing or
when speech recognition is not successful. In our
framework, by modeling the skill level as the user?s
property, we address a radical solution for the
unskilled users.
Knowledge Level on the Target Domain
There also exists a difference in the knowledge
level on the target domain among users. Thus, it is
necessary for the system to change information to
present to users. For example, it is not cooperative
to tell too detailed information to strangers. On the
other hand, for inhabitants, it is useful to omit too
obvious information and to output additive informa-
tion. Therefore, we introduce a dimension that rep-
resents the knowledge level on the target domain.
Degree of Hastiness
In speech communications, it is more important
to present information promptly and concisely com-
pared with the other communication modes such as
browsing. Especially in the bus system, the concise-
ness is preferred because the bus information is ur-
gent to most users. Therefore, we also take account
of degree of hastiness of the user, and accordingly
change the system?s responses.
3.2 Response Generation Strategy using User
Models
Next, we describe the response generation strategies
adapted to individual users based on the proposed
user models: skill level, knowledge level and hasti-
ness. Basic design of dialogue management is based
on mixed-initiative dialogue, in which the system
makes follow-up questions and guidance if neces-
sary while allowing a user to utter freely. It is in-
vestigated to add various contents to the system re-
sponses as cooperative responses in (Sadek, 1999).
Such additive information is usually cooperative, but
some people may feel such a response redundant.
Thus, we introduce the user models and control
the generation of additive information. By introduc-
ing the proposed user models, the system changes
generated responses by the following two aspects:
dialogue procedure and contents of responses.
Dialogue Procedure
The dialogue procedure is changed based on the
skill level and the hastiness. If a user is identified as
having the high skill level, the dialogue management
is carried out in a user-initiated manner; namely, the
system generates only open-ended prompts. On the
other hand, when user?s skill level is detected as low,
the system takes an initiative and prompts necessary
items in order.
When the degree of hastiness is low, the system
makes confirmation on the input contents. Con-
versely, when the hastiness is detected as high, such
a confirmation procedure is omitted.
Contents of Responses
Information that should be included in the sys-
tem response can be classified into the following two
items.
1. Dialogue management information
2. Domain-specific information
The dialogue management information specifies
how to carry out the dialogue including the instruc-
tion on user?s expression like ?Please reply with ei-
ther yes or no.? and the explanation about the fol-
lowing dialogue procedure like ?Now I will ask in
order.? This dialogue management information is
determined by the user?s skill level to the system,

is considered as low.
The domain-specific information is generated ac-
cording to the user?s knowledge level on the target
domain. Namely, for users unacquainted with the
local information, the system adds the explanation
about the nearest bus stop, and omits complicated
contents such as a proposal of another route.
The contents described above are also controlled
by the hastiness. For users who are not in hurry, the
system generates the additional contents as cooper-
ative responses. On the other hand, for hasty users,
the contents are omitted in order to prevent the dia-
logue from being redundant.
3.3 Classification of User based on Decision
Tree
In order to implement the proposed user models as a
classifier, we adopt a decision tree. It is constructed
by decision tree learning algorithm C5.0 (Quinlan,
1993) with data collected by our dialogue system.
Figure 3 shows the derived decision tree for the skill
level.
We use the features listed in Figure 4. They in-
clude not only semantic information contained in the
utterances but also information specific to spoken
dialogue systems such as the silence duration prior
to the utterance and the presence of barge-in. Ex-
cept for the last category of Figure 4 including ?at-
tribute of specified bus stops?, most of the features
are domain-independent.
The classification of each dimension is done for
every user utterance except for knowledge level. The
model of a user can change during a dialogue. Fea-
tures extracted from utterances are accumulated as
history information during the session.
Figure 5 shows an example of the system behav-
 features obtained from a single utterance
? dialogue state (defined by already filled slots)
? presence of barge-in
? lapsed time of the current utterance
? recognition result (something recognized / un-
certain / no input)
? score of speech recognizer
? the number of filled slots by the current utter-
ance
 features obtained from the session
? the number of utterances
? dialogue state of the previous utterance
? lapsed time from the beginning of the session
? the number of repetitions of a same question
? the average number of repetitions of a same
question
? ratio of the total time of user utterances in
whole elapsed time
? ratio of the occurrence of barge-in out of the
whole number of utterances
? recognition result of the previous utterance
? ratio of something recognized
? ratio of getting uncertain results
? ratio of no input
? the number of barge-in
? the number of something recognized
? the number of getting uncertain results
? the number of no input
? average of recognition scores
? the maximum number of slots filled by a single
utterance
 features obtained from the session (used only in clas-
sification of knowledge level)
? attribute of specified bus stops
? the way to specify bus stops (whether a bus stop
is specified by its correct name or not)
? ratio of each attribute of specified bus stops
? ratio of each way of specifying bus stops
Figure 4: Features to classify the user models
ior with the proposed user models. The skill level is
classified as being low by the decision tree, because
the first user?s utterance includes only one content
word. Then, dialogue procedure is changed to the
system-initiated one. Similarly, the hastiness is clas-
sified as being low by the decision tree, and the sys-
tem includes the explanation on the dialogue pro-
cedure and instruction on the expression in the re-
sponses. They are omitted if the hastiness is identi-
fied as high.
3.4 Decision Tree Learning for User Models
We train and evaluate the decision tree for the user
models using dialogue data collected by our system.
The data was collected from December 10th 2001 to
case: [skill level: low][knowledge level: low]
[hastiness: low]
Sys: Please tell me your current bus stop, your destination
or the specific bus route number.
User: Maruyama Park.
Sys: Let me confirm one by one.
( The explanation is added by [skill level: low].)
Will you get on at Maruyama Park?
( The content is confirmed by [hastiness: low].)
Please reply with yes or no.
( The instruction is added by [skill level: low].)
User: Yes.
Sys: Where will you get off the bus? Please specify by a
bus stop name or a well-known landmark.
( The explanation is added by [skill level: low].)
User: Tofukuji temple.
Sys: Will you get off the bus at Tofukuji temple?
Please reply with yes or no.
User: Yes.
Sys: The following buses are located.
( The explanation is added by [skill level: low].)
The nearest bus stop to Maruyama Park is Gion.
( The domain information is added by [knowl-
edge level: low].)
Bus number 202 bound for Nishioji-Kujo has de-
parted Higashiyama-Sanjo, which is two stops away.

Table 1: Number of manually labeled items for de-
cision tree learning
May 10th 2002. The number of the sessions (tele-
phone calls) is 215, and the total number of utter-
ances included in the sessions is 1492. We anno-
tated the subjective labels by hand. The annotator
judges the user models for every utterances based
on recorded speech data and logs. The labels were
given to the three dimensions described in section
3.3 among ?high?, ?indeterminable? or ?low?. It is
possible that annotated models of a user change dur-
ing a dialogue, especially from ?indeterminable? to
?low? or ?high?. The number of labeled utterances is
shown in Table 1.
Using the labeled data, we evaluated the classi-
fication accuracy of the proposed user models. All
the experiments were carried out by the method of
10-fold cross validation. The process, in which one
tenth of all data is used as the test data and the re-
mainder is used as the training data, is repeated ten
times, and the average of the accuracy is computed.
The result is shown in Table 2. The conditions #1,
#2 and #3 in Table 2 are described as follows.
#1: The 10-fold cross validation is carried out per
utterance.
#2: The 10-fold cross validation is carried out per
session (call).
#3: We calculate the accuracy under more realis-
tic condition. The accuracy is calculated not
in three classes (high / indeterminable / low)
but in two classes that actually affect the dia-
logue strategies. For example, the accuracy for
the skill level is calculated for the two classes:
low and the others. As to the classification of
knowledge level, the accuracy is calculated for
dialogue sessions because the features such as
the attribute of a specified bus stop are not ob-
tained in every utterance. Moreover, in order
to smooth unbalanced distribution of the train-
ing data, a cost corresponding to the reciprocal
ratio of the number of samples in each class is
introduced. By the cost, the chance rate of two
classes becomes 50%.
The difference between condition #1 and #2 is that
the training was carried out in a speaker-closed or
speaker-open manner. The former shows better per-
formance.
The result in condition #3 shows useful accuracy
in the skill level. The following features play im-
portant part in the decision tree for the skill level:
the number of filled slots by the current utterance,
presence of barge-in and ratio of no input. For the
knowledge level, recognition result (something rec-
ognized / uncertain / no input), ratio of no input and
the way to specify bus stops (whether a bus stop is
specified by its exact name or not) are effective. The
hastiness is classified mainly by the three features:
presence of barge-in, ratio of no input and lapsed
time of the current utterance.
condition #1 #2 #3
skill level 80.8% 75.3% 85.6%
knowledge level 73.9% 63.7% 78.2%
hastiness 74.9% 73.7% 78.6%
Table 2: Classification accuracy of the proposed user
models
4 Experimental Evaluation of the System
with User Models
We evaluated the system with the proposed user
models using 20 novice subjects who had not used
the system. The experiment was performed in the
laboratory under adequate control. For the speech
input, the headset microphone was used.
4.1 Experiment Procedure
First, we explained the outline of the system to sub-
jects and gave the document in which experiment
conditions and the scenarios were described. We
prepared two sets of eight scenarios. Subjects were
requested to acquire the bus information using the
system with/without the user models. In the sce-
narios, neither the concrete names of bus stops nor
the bus number were given. For example, one of
the scenarios was as follows: ?You are in Kyoto
for sightseeing. After visiting the Ginkakuji temple,
you go to Maruyama Park. Supposing such a situa-
tion, please get information on the bus.? We also set
the constraint in order to vary the subjects? hastiness
such as ?Please hurry as much as possible in order
to save the charge of your cellular phone.?
The subjects were also told to look over question-
naire items before the experiment, and filled in them
after using each system. This aims to reduce the sub-
ject?s cognitive load and possible confusion due to
switching the systems (Over, 1999). The question-
naire consisted of eight items, for example, ?When
the dialogue did not go well, did the system guide in-
telligibly?? We set seven steps for evaluation about
each item, and the subject selected one of them.
Furthermore, subjects were asked to write down
the obtained information: the name of the bus stop
to get on, the bus number and how much time it
takes before the bus arrives. With this procedure,
we planned to make the experiment condition close
to the realistic one.

(with UM w/o UM) w/o UM 47.1 4.18
group 2 w/o UM 85.4 8.23
(w/o UM with UM) with UM 46.7 4.08
UM: User Model
Table 3: Duration and the number of turns in dia-
logue
The subjects were divided into two groups; a half
(group 1) used the system in the order of ?with
user models  without user models?, the other half
(group 2) used in the reverse order.
The dialogue management in the system without
user models is also based on the mixed-initiative di-
alogue. The system generates follow-up questions
and guidance if necessary, but behaves in a fixed
manner. Namely, additive cooperative contents cor-
responding to skill level described in section 3.2 are
not generated and the dialogue procedure is changed
only after recognition errors occur. The system with-
out user models behaves equivalently to the initial
state of the user models: the hastiness is low, the
knowledge level is low and the skill level is high.
4.2 Results
All of the subjects successfully completed the given
task, although they had been allowed to give up if the
system did not work well. Namely, the task success
rate is 100%.
Average dialogue duration and the number of
turns in respective cases are shown in Table 3.
Though the users had not experienced the system at
all, they got accustomed to the system very rapidly.
Therefore, as shown in Table 3, both the duration
and the number of turns were decreased obviously
in the latter half of the experiment in either group.
However, in the initial half of the experiment, the
group 1 completed with significantly shorter dia-
logue than group 2. This means that the incorpora-
tion of the user models is effective for novice users.
Table 4 shows a ratio of utterances for which the
skill level was identified as high. The ratio is calcu-
lated by dividing the number of utterances that were
judged as high skill level by the number of all utter-
ances in the eight sessions. The ratio is much larger
for group 1 who initially used the system with user
group 1 with UM 0.72
(with UM  w/o UM) w/o UM 0.70
group 2 w/o UM 0.41
(w/o UM  with UM) with UM 0.63
Table 4: Ratio of utterances for which the skill level
was judged as high
models. This fact means that novice users got ac-
customed to the system more rapidly with the user
models, because they were instructed on the usage
by cooperative responses generated when the skill
level is low. The results demonstrate that coopera-
tive responses generated according to the proposed
user models can serve as good guidance for novice
users.
In the latter half of the experiment, the dialogue
duration and the number of turns were almost same
between the two groups. This result shows that the
proposed models prevent the dialogue from becom-
ing redundant for skilled users, although generating
cooperative responses for all users made the dia-
logue verbose in general. It suggests that the pro-
posed user models appropriately control the genera-
tion of cooperative responses by detecting characters
of individual users.
5 Conclusions
We have proposed and evaluated user models for
generating cooperative responses adaptively to in-
dividual users. The proposed user models consist
of the three dimensions: skill level to the system,
knowledge level on the target domain and the de-
gree of hastiness. The user models are identified us-
ing features specific to spoken dialogue systems as
well as semantic attributes. They are automatically
derived by decision tree learning, and all features
used for skill level and hastiness are independent of
domain-specific knowledge. So, it is expected that
the derived user models can be used in other do-
mains generally.
The experimental evaluation with 20 novice users
shows that the skill level of novice users was im-
proved more rapidly by incorporating the user mod-
els, and accordingly the dialogue duration becomes
shorter more immediately. The result is achieved
by the generated cooperative responses based on the
proposed user models. The proposed user models
also suppress the redundancy by changing the dia-
logue procedure and selecting contents of responses.
Thus, they realize user-adaptive dialogue strategies,
in which the generated cooperative responses serve
as good guidance for novice users without increas-
ing the dialogue duration for skilled users.

Abstract
We realize a telephone-based collab-
orative natural language dialogue sys-
tem. Since natural language involves
very various expressions, a large num-
ber of VoiceXML scripts need to be pre-
pared to handle all possible input patterns.
We realize flexible dialogue management
for various user utterances by generating
VoiceXML scripts dynamically. More-
over, we address appropriate user mod-
eling in order to generate cooperative re-
sponses to each user. Specifically, we set
up three dimensions of user models: skill
level to the system, knowledge level on
the target domain and the degree of hasti-
ness. The models are automatically de-
rived by decision tree learning using real
dialogue data collected by the system. Ex-
perimental evaluation shows that the co-
operative responses adapted to individual
users serve as good guidance for novice
users without increasing the dialogue du-
ration for skilled users.

1 Introduction
A Spoken dialogue system is one of the promising
applications of the speech recognition and natural
language understanding technologies. A typical task
of spoken dialogue systems is database retrieval.
Some IVR (interactive voice response) systems us-
ing the speech recognition technology are being put
into practical use as its simplest form. According to
the spread of cellular phones, spoken dialogue sys-
tems via telephone enable us to obtain information
from various places without any other special appa-
ratuses.
In order to realize user-friendly interaction, spo-
ken dialogue systems should be able to (1) accept
various user utterances to enable mixed-initiative di-
alogue and (2) generate cooperative responses. Cur-
rently, a lot of IVR systems via telephone operate
by using VoiceXML, which is a script language to
prescribe procedures of spoken dialogues. How-
ever, only the next behaviors corresponding to ev-
ery input are prescribed in the VoiceXML scripts,
so the dialogue procedure is basically designed as
system-initiated one, in which the system asked re-
quired items one by one. In order to realize mixed-
initiative dialogue, the system should be able to ac-
cept various user-initiated utterances. By allowing
to accept various user utterances, the combination
of words included in the utterances accordingly gets
enormous, and then it is practically impossible to
prepare VoiceXML scripts that correspond to the
enormous combinations of input words in advance.
It is also difficult to generate cooperative responses
adaptively in the above framework.
We propose a framework to generate VoiceXML
scripts dynamically in order to realize the mixed-
initiative dialogue, in which the system is needed to
accept various user utterances. This framework real-
izes flexible dialogue management without requiring
preparation for a large number of VoiceXML scripts
in advance. Furthermore, it enables various behav-
iors adaptive to the dialogue situations such as ob-
tained query results.
Another problem to realize user-friendly interac-
tion is how to generate cooperative responses. When
we consider the responses generated from the sys-
tem side, the dialogue strategies, which determine
when to make guidance and what the system should
tell to the user, are the essential factors in spoken di-
alogue systems. There are many studies in respect of
the dialogue strategy such as confirmation manage-
ment using confidence measures of speech recogni-
tion results (Komatani and Kawahara, 2000; Hazen
et al, 2000), dynamic change of dialogue initiative
(Litman and Pan, 2000; Chu-Carroll, 2000; Lamel
et al, 1999), and addition of cooperative contents
to system responses (Sadek, 1999). Nevertheless,
whether a particular response is cooperative or not
depends on individual user?s characteristic.
In order to adapt the system?s behavior to individ-
ual users, it is necessary to model the user?s patterns
(Kass and Finin, 1988). Most of conventional stud-
ies on user models have focused on the knowledge
of users. Others tried to infer and utilize user?s goals
to generate responses adapted to the user (van Beek,
1987; Paris, 1988). Elzer et al (2000) proposed
a method to generate adaptive suggestions accord-
ing to users? preferences. However, these studies
depend on knowledge of the target domain greatly,
and therefore the user models need to be deliberated
manually to be applied to new domains. Moreover,
they assumed that the input is text only, which does
not contain errors.
We propose more comprehensive user models to
generate user-adapted responses in spoken dialogue
systems taking account of information specific to
spoken dialogue. Spoken utterances include vari-
ous information such as the interval between the ut-
terances, the presence of barge-in and so on, which
can be utilized to judge the user?s character. These
features also possess generality in spoken dialogue
systems because they are not dependent on domain-
specific knowledge. As user models in spoken di-
alogue systems, Eckert et al (1997) defined stereo-
types of users such as patient, submissive and ex-
perienced, in order to evaluate spoken dialogue sys-
tems by simulation. We introduce user models not
for defining users? behaviors beforehand, but for de-
tecting users? patterns in real-time interaction.
We define three dimensions in the user models:
?skill level to the system?, ?knowledge level on the
target domain? and ?degree of hastiness?. The user
models are trained by decision tree learning algo-
rithm, using real data collected from the Kyoto city
bus information system. Then, we implement the
user models on the system and evaluate them using
data collected with 20 novice users.
2 Flexible Spoken Dialogue System based
on Dynamic Generation of VoiceXML
Scripts
VoiceXML1 is a script language to prescribe pro-
cedures in spoken dialogues mainly on telephone,
and is becoming to a standard language of IVR sys-
tems. The VoiceXML scripts consist of three parts:
(1) specifications of system?s prompts, (2) specifica-
tions of grammars to accept a user?s utterance, and
(3) description of the next behaviors.
However, most of existing services using the
VoiceXML imposes rigid interaction, in which user
utterances are restricted by system-initiated prompts
and a user is accordingly allowed to specify only re-
quested items one by one. It is more user-friendly
that users can freely convey their requests by natural
language expressions.
We present a framework to realize flexible inter-
action by generating VoiceXML scripts dynamically
(Pargellis et al, 1999; Nyberg et al, 2002). The
framework enables users to express their requests
by natural language even in VoiceXML-based sys-
tems. Furthermore, cooperative responses in the Ky-
oto city bus information system that has been devel-
oped in our laboratory are also presented in this sec-
tion.
2.1 Dynamic Generation of VoiceXML Scripts
In VoiceXML scripts, acceptable keywords and cor-
responding next states must be explicitly specified.
However, since there exists enormous combinations
of keywords in natural language expressions, it is
practically impossible to describe all VoiceXML
scripts that correspond to the combinations. Then,
we introduce the framework in which VoiceXML

Figure 1: Overview of spoken dialogue system
based on dynamic generation of VoiceXML scripts
scripts are generated dynamically to enable the sys-
tem to accept natural language expressions.
Figure 1 shows the overview of the framework.
The front end that operates based on VoiceXML
scripts is separated from the dialogue management
portion, which accepts speech recognition results
and generates corresponding VoiceXML scripts.
The user utterance is recognized based on a gram-
mar rule specified in VoiceXML scripts, and key-
words extracted from a speech recognition result are
passed to a CGI script. The CGI script retrieves cor-
responding information from the database on Web,
and generates a VoiceXML script for the succeed-
ing interaction. If sufficient information is not ob-
tained from a user utterance, a script that prompts to
fill remaining contents is generated, and if the user
utterance contains ambiguity, a script that makes a
disambiguating question is generated.
Consequently, the generation of VoiceXML
scripts enables to accept natural language expres-
sions without preparing a large number of the scripts
corresponding to various inputs beforehand. The
framework also enables to generate cooperative re-
sponses adapted to the situation such as retrieval re-
sults without spoiling portability.
Sys: Please tell me your current bus stop, your destination
or the specific bus route.
User: Shijo-Kawaramachi.
Sys: Do you take a bus from Shijo-Kawaramachi?
User: Yes.
Sys: Where will you get off the bus?
User: Arashiyama.
Sys: Do you go from Shijo-Kawaramachi to Arashiyama?
User: Yes.
Sys: Bus number 11 bound for Arashiyama has departed
Sanjo-Keihanmae, two bus stops away.
Figure 2: Example dialogue of the bus system
2.2 Kyoto City Bus Information System
We have developed the Kyoto city bus information
system, which locates the bus a user wants to take,
and tell him/her how long it will take before arriving.
The system can be accessed via telephone including
cellular phones2. From any places, users can easily
get the information on the bus that changes every
minute. Users are requested to input the bus stop to
get on, the destination, or the bus route number by
speech, and consequently get the bus information.
There are 652 bus stops and 85 bus routes in Kyoto
city. The bus stops can also be specified by the name
of famous places or public facilities nearby. Figure
2 shows a simple example of the dialogue.
2.3 Generation of Cooperative Responses in
Kyoto City Bus Information System
In spoken dialogue systems, it is important to gener-
ate cooperative responses by guessing the user?s in-
tention. The cooperative responses consist of adding
information more than the user has requested, telling
the reason when there is no query result, present-
ing the alternatives, and so on (Sadek, 1999). In
order to generate cooperative responses, it is neces-
sary to change responses according to the situations.
Since we separate language-understanding modules
from individual VoiceXML scripts that are gener-
ated dynamically, our system can generate appropri-
ate responses cooperatively according to query re-
sults. The examples of the cooperative responses
implemented in our Kyoto city bus information sys-
tem are listed below.
2+81-75-326-3116
(1) Suggestive answers
The information related to a query result is offered
when the query result is negative.
(Example)
User: From Hyakumanben to Kyoto Station by bus
number 17.
Sys: Bus number 17 does not come for a while, but
bus number 206 has departed Takano, four bus
stops away.
(2) Corrective answers
The reason is presented when there is no query result
or when a user utterance contains an error.
(Example)
User: From Kyoto Station to Arashiyama.
Sys: There is no bus that directly goes from Kyoto
station to Arashiyama.
(3) Intensional answers
If several query results are obtained, generating in-
tensional answer is more cooperative than listing all
the results.
(Example)
User: From Shijo-Kawaramachi to Shijo-Karasuma.
Sys: All buses to Shijo-Karasuma do not come for a
while.
(4) Completion answers
It is cooperative to generate responses including in-
formation more than the user?s request. However,
whether the information should be presented or not
differs in individual users.
(Example)
User: From Kyoto station by bus number 5.
Sys: Bus number 5 will depart at 17:34 from plat-
form ?A1?.
(There are a lot of platforms in Kyoto station.)
3 Response Generation Using User Models
We propose comprehensive user models to generate
user-adaptive responses taking account of informa-
tion specific to spoken dialogue. Whether a partic-
ular response is regarded as cooperative depends on
individual user?s characteristics. So, we address ap-
propriate user modeling in order to generate cooper-
ative responses to the users.
3.1 Classification of User Models
We define three dimensions as user models listed be-
low.
? Skill level to the system
? Knowledge level on the target domain
? Degree of hastiness
Skill Level to the System
Since spoken dialogue systems are not
widespread yet, there arises a difference in the
skill level of users in operating the systems. It
is desirable that the system changes its behavior
including response generation and initiative man-
agement in accordance with the skill level of the
user. In conventional systems, a system-initiated
guidance has been invoked on the spur of the
moment either when the user says nothing or
when speech recognition is not successful. In our
framework, we address a radical solution for the
unskilled users by modeling the skill level as the
user?s property before such a problem arises.
Knowledge Level on the Target Domain
There also exists a difference in the knowledge
level on the target domain among users. Thus, it is
necessary for the system to change information to
present to users. For example, it is not cooperative
to tell too detailed information to strangers. On the
other hand, for inhabitants, it is useful to omit too
obvious information and to output more detailed in-
formation. Therefore, we introduce a dimension that
represents the knowledge level on the target domain.
Degree of Hastiness
In speech communications, it is more important
to present information promptly and concisely com-
pared with the other communication modes such as
browsing. Especially in the bus system, the concise-
ness is preferred because the bus information is ur-
gent to most users. Therefore, we also take account
of degree of hastiness of the user, and accordingly
change the system?s responses.
3.2 Response Generation Strategy Using User
Models
Next, we describe the response generation strategies
adapted to individual users based on the proposed
user models: skill level, knowledge level and hasti-
ness. Basic design of dialogue management is based
on mixed-initiative dialogue, in which the system
makes follow-up questions and guidance if neces-
sary while allowing a user to utter freely. It is in-
vestigated to add various contents to the system re-
sponses as cooperative responses in (Sadek, 1999).
Such additional information is usually cooperative,
but some people may feel such a response redun-
dant.
Thus, we introduce the user models and con-
trol the generation of additional information. By
introducing the proposed user models, the system
changes generated responses by the following two
aspects: dialogue procedure and contents of re-
sponses.
Dialogue Procedure
The dialogue procedure is changed based on the
skill level and the hastiness. If a user is identified as
having the high skill level, the dialogue management
is carried out in a user-initiated manner; namely, the
system generates only open-ended prompts. On the
other hand, when user?s skill level is detected as low,
the system takes an initiative and prompts necessary
items in order.
When the degree of hastiness is low, the system
makes confirmation on the input contents. Con-
versely, when the hastiness is detected as high, such
a confirmation procedure is omitted; namely, the
system immediately makes a query and outputs the
result without making such a confirmation.
Contents of Responses
Information that should be included in the sys-
tem response can be classified into the following two
items.
1. Dialogue management information
2. Domain-specific information
The dialogue management information specifies
how to carry out the dialogue including the instruc-
tion on user?s expression for yes/no questions like
?Please reply with either yes or no.? and the expla-
nation about the following dialogue procedure like
?Now I will ask in order.? This dialogue manage-
ment information is determined by the user?s skill

when the skill level is considered as low.
The domain-specific information is generated ac-
cording to the user?s knowledge level on the target
domain. Namely, for users unacquainted with the
local information, the system adds the explanation
about the nearest bus stop, and omits complicated
contents such as a proposal of another route.
The contents described above are also controlled
by the hastiness. For users who are not in hurry, the
system generates the additional contents that corre-
spond to their skill level and knowledge level as co-
operative responses. On the other hand, for hasty
users, the contents are omitted to prevent the dia-
logue from being redundant.
3.3 Classification of User based on Decision
Tree
In order to implement the proposed user models as
classifiers, we adopt a decision tree. It is constructed
by decision tree learning algorithm C5.0 (Quinlan,
1993) with data collected by our dialogue system.
Figure 3 shows an example of the derived decision
tree for the skill level.
We use the features listed in Figure 4. They in-
clude not only semantic information contained in the
utterances but also information specific to spoken di-
alogue systems such as the silence duration prior to
the utterance, the presence of barge-in and so on.
Except for the last category of Figure 4 including
?attribute of specified bus stops?, most of the fea-
tures are domain-independent.
The classification of each dimension is done for
every user utterance except for knowledge level. The
model of a user can change during a dialogue. Fea-
tures extracted from utterances are accumulated as
history information during the session.
? features obtained from a single utterance
? dialogue state (defined by already filled slots)
? presence of barge-in
? lapsed time of the current utterance
? recognition result (something recognized / un-
certain / no input)
? score of speech recognizer
? the number of filled slots by the current utter-
ance
? features obtained from the session
? the number of utterances
? dialogue state of the previous utterance
? lapsed time from the beginning of the session
? the number of the repetition of a same question
? the average number of the repetition of a same
question
? ratio of the time of user utterances in whole
elapsed time
? ratio of the occurrence of barge-in out of the
whole number of utterances
? recognition result of the previous utterance
? ratio of something recognized
? ratio of getting uncertain results
? ratio of no input
? the number of barge-in
? the number of something recognized
? the number of getting uncertain results
? the number of no input
? average of recognition scores
? the maximum number of slots filled by a single
utterance
? features obtained from the session (used only in clas-
sification of knowledge level)
? attribute of specified bus stops
? the way of specifying bus stops (whether a bus
stop is specified by its correct name or not)
? ratio of each attribute of specified bus stops
? ratio of each way of specifying bus stops
Figure 4: Features to classify the user models
Figure 5 shows an example of the system behav-
ior with the proposed user models. The skill level is
classified as being low by the decision tree, because
the first user?s utterance includes only one content
word. Then, dialogue procedure is changed to the
system-initiated one. Similarly, the hastiness is clas-
sified as being low by the decision tree, and the sys-
tem includes the explanation on the dialogue pro-
cedure and the instruction on the expression in the
responses. They are omitted if the hastiness is iden-
tified as high.
3.4 Decision Tree Learning for User Models
We train and evaluate the decision tree for the user
models using dialogue data collected by our sys-
case: [skill level: low][knowledge level: low]
[hastiness: low]
Sys: Please tell me your current bus stop, your destination
or the specific bus route number.
User: Maruyama Park.
Sys: Let me confirm one by one.
(? The explanation is added by [skill level: low].)
Will you get on at Maruyama Park?
(? The content is confirmed by [hastiness: low].)
Please reply with yes or no.
(? The instruction is added by [skill level: low].)
User: Yes.
Sys: Where will you get off the bus? Please specify by a
bus stop name or a well-known landmark.
(? The explanation is added by [skill level: low].)
User: Tofukuji temple.
Sys: Will you get off the bus at Tofukuji temple?
Please reply with yes or no.
User: Yes.
Sys: The following buses are located.
(? The explanation is added by [skill level: low].)
The nearest bus stop to Maruyama Park is Gion.
(? The domain information is added by [knowl-
edge level: low].)
Bus number 202 bound for Nishioji-Kujo has de-
parted Higashiyama-Sanjo, which is two stops away.

2001 to May 10th 2002. The number of the ses-
sions (telephone calls) is 215, and the total number
of utterances included in the sessions is 1492. We
annotated the subjective labels of the user models
by hand. The annotator judges the user models for
every utterance based on the recorded speech data
and logs. The labels were given to the three dimen-
sions described in section 3.1 among ?high?, ?inde-
terminable? or ?low?. It is possible that the annotated
model of a user changes during a dialogue, espe-
cially from ?indeterminable? to ?low? or ?high?. The
number of the labeled utterances is shown in Table
1.
condition #1 #2 #3
skill level 80.8% 75.3% 85.6%
knowledge level 73.9% 63.7% 78.2%
hastiness 74.9% 73.7% 78.6%
Table 2: Classification accuracy of the proposed user
models
Using the labeled data, we trained the decision
tree and evaluated the classification accuracy of the
proposed user models. All the experiments were car-
ried out by the method of 10-fold cross validation.
The process, in which one tenth of all data is used as
the test data, and the remainder is used as the train-
ing data, is repeated ten times, and the average of
the classification accuracy is computed. The result
is shown in Table 2. The conditions #1, #2 and #3 in
Table 2 are described as follows.
#1: The 10-fold cross validation is carried out per
utterance.
#2: The 10-fold cross validation is carried out per
session (call).
#3: We calculate the accuracy under more realis-
tic condition. The accuracy is calculated not
in three classes (high / indeterminable / low)
but in two classes that actually affect the dia-
logue strategies. For example, the accuracy for
the skill level is calculated for the two classes:
low and the others. As to the classification of
knowledge level, the accuracy is calculated for
dialogue sessions, because the features such as
the attribute of a specified bus stop are not ob-
tained in every utterance. Moreover, in order
to smooth unbalanced distribution of the train-
ing data, a cost corresponding to the reciprocal
ratio of the number of samples in each class is
introduced. By the cost, the chance rate of two
classes becomes 50%.
The difference between condition #1 and #2 is
that the training was carried out in a speaker-closed
or speaker-open manner. The former shows better
performance.
The result in condition #3 shows useful accuracy
in the skill level. The following features play im-
portant part in the decision tree for the skill level:

knowledge level, recognition result (something rec-
ognized / uncertain / no input), ratio of no input and
the way to specify bus stops (whether a bus stop is
specified by its exact name or not) are effective. The
hastiness is classified mainly by the three features:
presence of barge-in, ratio of no input and lapsed
time of the current utterance.
3.5 System Overview
Figure 6 shows an overview of the Kyoto city bus in-
formation system with the user models. The system
operates by generating VoiceXML scripts dynami-
cally as described in section 2.1. The real-time bus
information database is provided on the Web, which
can be accessed via Internet. Then, we explain the
modules in the following.
VWS (Voice Web Server)
The Voice Web Server drives the speech recog-
nition engine and the TTS (Text-To-Speech)
module accordingly to the specifications by the
generated VoiceXML script.
Speech Recognizer
The speech recognizer decodes user utterances
based on specified grammar rules and vocabu-
lary, which are defined by VoiceXML at each
dialogue state.
Dialogue Manager
The dialogue manager generates response sen-
tences based on recognition results (bus stop
names or a route number) received from the
VWS. If sufficient information to locate a bus
is obtained, it retrieves the corresponding bus
information on the Web.
VoiceXML Generator
This module dynamically generates VoiceXML
scripts that contain response sentences and
specifications of speech recognition grammars,
which are given by the dialogue manager.
User model identifier
This module classifies user?s characters based
on the user models using features specific to
spoken dialogue as well as semantic attributes.
The obtained user profiles are sent to the dia-
logue manager, and are utilized in the dialogue
management and response generation.
4 Experimental Evaluation of the System
with User Models
We evaluated the system with the proposed user
models using 20 novice subjects who had not used
the system. The experiment was performed in the
laboratory under adequate control. For the speech
input, the headset microphone was used.
4.1 Experiment Procedure
First, we explained the outline of the system to sub-
jects and gave a document in which experiment con-
ditions and scenarios were described. We prepared
two sets of eight scenarios. Subjects were requested
to acquire the bus information according to the sce-
narios using the system with/without the user mod-
els. In the scenarios, neither the concrete names of
bus stops nor the bus number were given. For exam-
ple, one of the scenarios was as follows: ?You are in
Kyoto for sightseeing. After visiting the Ginkakuji
temple, you go to Maruyama Park. Supposing such
a situation, please get information on the bus.? We
also set the constraint in order to vary the subjects?
hastiness such as ?Please hurry as much as possible
in order to save the charge of your cellular phone.?
The subjects were also told to look over question-
naire items before the experiment, and filled in them
duration (sec.) # turn
group 1 with UM 51.9 4.03
(with UM? w/o UM) w/o UM 47.1 4.18
group 2 w/o UM 85.4 8.23
(w/o UM? with UM) with UM 46.7 4.08
UM: User Model
Table 3: Duration and the number of turns in dia-
logue
after using each system. This aims to reduce the sub-
ject?s cognitive load and possible confusion due to
switching the systems (Over, 1999). The question-
naire consisted of eight items, for example, ?When
the dialogue did not go well, did the system guide in-
telligibly?? We set seven steps for evaluation about
each item, and the subject selected one of them.
Furthermore, subjects were asked to write down
the obtained information: the name of the bus stop
to get on, the bus number and how much time it
takes before the bus arrives. With this procedure,
we planned to make the experiment condition close
to the realistic one.
The subjects were divided into two groups; a half
(group 1) used the system in the order of ?with
user models ? without user models?, the other half
(group 2) used in the reverse order.
The dialogue management in the system without
user models is also based on the mixed-initiative
dialogue. The system generates follow-up ques-
tions and guidance if necessary, but behaves in a
fixed manner. Namely, additional cooperative con-
tents corresponding to skill level described in section
3.2 are not generated and the dialogue procedure is
changed only after recognition errors occur. The
system without user models behaves equivalently to
the initial state of the user models: the hastiness is
low, the knowledge level is low and the skill level is
high.
4.2 Results
All of the subjects successfully completed the given
task, although they had been allowed to give up if the
system did not work well. Namely, the task success
rate is 100%.
Average dialogue duration and the number of
turns in respective cases are shown in Table 3.
Though the users had not experienced the system at
group 1 with UM 0.72
(with UM ? w/o UM) w/o UM 0.70
group 2 w/o UM 0.41
(w/o UM ? with UM) with UM 0.63
Table 4: Ratio of utterances for which the skill level
was judged as high
all, they got accustomed to the system very rapidly.
Therefore, as shown in Table 3, the duration and
the number of turns were decreased obviously in the
latter half of the experiment in both groups. How-
ever, in the initial half of the experiment, the group
1 completed with significantly shorter dialogue than
group 2. This means that the incorporation of the
user models is effective for novice users. Table 4
shows a ratio of utterances for which the skill level
was identified as high. The ratio is calculated by di-
viding the number of utterances that were judged as
high skill level by the number of all utterances. The
ratio is much larger for group 1 who initially used
the system with user models. This fact means that
the novice users got accustomed to the system more
rapidly with the user models, because they were in-
structed on the usage by cooperative responses gen-
erated when the skill level is low. The results demon-
strate that cooperative responses generated accord-
ing to the proposed user models can serve as good
guidance for novice users.
In the latter half of the experiment, the dialogue
duration and the number of turns were almost same
between the two groups. This result shows that the
proposed models prevent the dialogue from becom-
ing redundant for skilled users, although generating
cooperative responses for all users made the dia-
logue verbose in general. It suggests that the pro-
posed user models appropriately control the genera-
tion of cooperative responses by detecting characters
of individual users.
5 Conclusions
We have presented a framework to realize flexible
interaction by dynamically generating VoiceXML
scripts. This framework realizes mixed-initiative di-
alogues and the generation of cooperative responses
in VoiceXML-based systems.
We have also proposed and evaluated user mod-
els for generating cooperative responses adaptively
to individual users. The proposed user models con-
sist of the three dimensions: skill level to the sys-
tem, knowledge level on the target domain and the
degree of hastiness. The user models are identified
by decision tree using features specific to spoken di-
alogue systems as well as semantic attributes. They
are automatically derived by decision tree learning,
and all features used for skill level and hastiness are
independent of domain-specific knowledge. So, it is
expected that the derived user models can be gener-
ally used in other domains.
The experimental evaluation with 20 novice users
shows that the skill level of novice users was im-
proved more rapidly by incorporating user mod-
els, and accordingly the dialogue duration becomes
shorter more immediately. The result is achieved
by the generated cooperative responses based on the
proposed user models. The proposed user models
also suppress the redundancy by changing the dia-
logue procedure and selecting contents of responses.
Thus, the framework generating VoiceXML
scripts dynamically and the proposed user models
realize a user-adaptive dialogue strategies, in which
the generated cooperative responses serve as good
guidance for novice users without increasing the di-
alogue duration for skilled users.
