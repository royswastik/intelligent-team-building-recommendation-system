Abstract 
In this paper we describe the Senseval 3 
Basque lexical sample task. The task 
comprised 40 words (15 nouns, 15 verbs and 
10 adjectives) selected from the Basque 
WordNet. 10 of the words were chosen in 
coordination with other lexical-sample tasks. 
The examples were taken from newspapers, an 
in-house balanced corpus and Internet texts. 
We additionally included a large set of 
untagged examples, and a lemmatised version 
of the data including lemma, PoS and case 
information. The method used to hand-tag the 
examples produced an inter-tagger agreement 
of 78.2% before arbitration. The eight 
competing systems attained results well above 
the most frequent baseline and the best system 
from Swarthmore College scored 70.4% 
recall. 
1 Introduction 
This paper reviews the Basque lexical-sample task 
organized for Senseval 3. Each participant was 
provided with a relatively small set of labelled 
examples (2/3 of 75+15*senses+7*multiwords) 
and a comparatively large set of unlabelled 
examples (roughly ten times more when possible) 
for around 40 words. The larger number of 
unlabelled data was released with the purpose to 
enable the exploration of semi-supervised systems. 
The test set comprised 1/3 of the tagged examples. 
The sense inventory was taken from the Basque 
WordNet, which is linked to WordNet version 1.6 
(Fellbaum, 1998). The examples came mainly from 
newspaper texts, although we also used a balanced 
in-house corpus and texts from Internet. The words 
selected for this task were coordinated with other 
lexical-sample tasks (such as Catalan, English, 
Italian, Romanian and Spanish) in order to share 
around 10 of the target words.  
The following steps were taken in order to carry 
out the task:

2 Setting of the exercise  
In this section we present the setting of the 
Basque lexical-sample exercise. 
2.1 Basque 
As Basque is an agglutinative language, the 
dictionary entry takes each of the elements 
necessary to form the different functions. More 
specifically, the affixes corresponding to the 
determinant, number and declension case are taken 
in this order and independently of each other (deep 
morphological structure). For instance, ?etxekoari 
emaiozu? can be roughly translated as ?[to the one 
in the house] [give it]? where the underlined 
sequence of suffixes in Basque corresponds to ?to 
the one in the?.  
2.2 Sense inventory 
We chose the Basque WordNet, linked to 
WordNet 1.6, for the sense inventory. This way, 
the hand tagging enabled us to check the sense 
coverage and overall quality of the Basque 
WordNet, which is under construction. The Basque 
WordNet is available at http://ixa3.si.ehu.es/ 
wei3.html.

2.3 Corpora used 
Being Basque a minority language it is not easy 
to find the required number of occurrences for each 
word. We wanted to have both balanced and 
newspaper examples, but we also had to include 
texts extracted from the web, specially for the 
untagged corpus. The procedure to find examples 
from the web was the following: for each target 
word all possible morphological declensions were 
automatically generated, searched in a search-
engine, documents retrieved, automatically 
lemmatized (Aduriz et al 2000), filtered using 
some heuristics to ensure quality of context, and 
finally filtered for PoS mismatches. Table 1 shows 
the number of examples from each source. 
2.4 Words chosen 
Basically, the words employed in this task are 
the same words used in Senseval 2 (40 words, 15 
nouns, 15 verbs and 10 adjectives), only the sense 
inventory changed. Besides, in Senseval 3 we 
replaced 5 verbs with new ones. The reason for this 
is that in the context of the MEANING project1 we 
are exploring multilingual lexical acquisition, and 
there are ongoing experiments that focus on those 
verbs. (Agirre et al 2004; Atserias et al 2004). 
In fact, 10 words in the English lexical-sample 
have translations in the Basque, Catalan, Italian, 
Romanian and Spanish lexical tasks: channel, 
crown, letter, program, party (nouns), simple 
(adjective), play, win, lose, decide (verbs).  
2.5 Selection of examples from corpora 
The minimum number of examples for each 
word according to the task specifications was 
calculated as follows: 
 
N=75+15*senses+7*multiwords  
 
As the number of senses in WordNet is very high, 
we decided to first estimate the number of senses 
and multiwords that really occur in the corpus. The 
taggers were provided with a sufficient number of 
examples, but they did not have to tag all. After 
they had tagged around 100 examples, they would 
count the number of senses and multiwords that 
had occurred and computed the N according to 
those counts.  
The context is constituted of 5 sentences, 
including the sentence with the target word 
appearing in the middle. Links were kept to the 
source corpus, document, and to the newspaper 
section when applicable.  
The occurrences were split at random in training 
set (2/3 of all occurrences) and test set (1/3).

3 Hand tagging 
Three persons, graduate linguistics students, 
took part in the tagging. They are familiar with 
word senses, as they are involved in the 
development of the Basque WordNet. The 
following procedure was defined in the tagging of 
each word. 
? Before tagging, one of the linguists (the editor) 
revised the 40 words in the Basque WordNet. 
She had to delete and add senses to the words, 
specially for adjectives and verbs, and was 
allowed to check the examples in the corpus.  
? The three taggers would meet, read the glosses 
and examples given in the Basque WordNet 
and discuss the meaning of each synset. They 
tried to agree and clarify the meaning 
differences among the synsets. For each word 
two hand-taggers and a referee is assigned by 
chance. 
? The number of senses of a word in the Basque 
WordNet might change during this meeting; 
that is, linguists could agree that one of the 
word?s senses was missing, or that a synset did 
not fit with a word. This was done prior to 
looking at the corpus. Then, the editor would 
update the Basque WordNet according to those 
decisions before giving the taggers the final 
synset list. Overall (including first bullet 
above), 143 senses were deleted and 92 senses 
added, leaving a total of 316 senses. This 
reflects the current situation of the Basque 
WordNet, which is still under construction. 
? Two taggers independently tagged all 
examples for the word. No communication was 
allowed while tagging the word. 
? Multiple synset tags were allowed, as well as 
the following tags: the lemma (in the case of 
multiword terms), U (unassignable), P (proper 
noun), and X (incorrectly lemmatized). Those 
with an X were removed from the final release. 
In the case of proper nouns and multiword 
terms no synset tag was assigned. Sometimes 
the U tag was used for word senses which are 
not in the Basque WordNet. For instance, the 
sense of kanal corresponding to TV channel, 
which is the most frequent sense in the 
examples, is not present in the Basque 
WordNet (it was not included in WordNet 1.6).  
? A program was used to compute agreement 
rates and to output those occurrences where 
there was disagreement. Those occurrences 
were  grouped by the senses assigned. 
? A third tagger, the referee, reviewed the 
disagreements and decided which one was the 
correct sense (or senses).  
The taggers were allowed to return more than one 
sense, and they returned 9887 tags (1.34 per 
occurrence). Overall, the two taggers agreed in at 
least one tag 78.2% of the time. Some words 
attained an agreement rate above 95% (e.g. nouns 
kanal or tentsio), but others like herri ?
town/people/nation? attained only 52% agreement. 
On average, the whole tagging task took 54 
seconds per occurrence for the tagger, and 20 
seconds for the referee. However, this average 
does not include the time the taggers and the 
referee spent in the meetings they did to 
understand the meaning of each synset. The 
comprehension of a word with all its synsets 
required 45.5 minutes on average. 
4 Final release 
Table 1 includes the total amount of hand-tagged 
and untagged examples that were released. In 
addition to the usual release, the training and 
testing data were also provided in a lemmatized 
version (Aduriz et al 2000) which included 
lemma, PoS and case information. The motivation 
was twofold: 
? to make participation of the teams easier, 
considering the deep inflection of Basque. 
? to factor out the impact of different 
lemmatizers and PoS taggers in the system 
comparison.  
5 Participants and Results 
5 teams took part in this task: Swarthmore 
College (swat), Basque Country University 
(BCU), Instituto per la Ricerca Scientifica e 
Tecnologica (IRST), University of Minnesota 
Duluth (Duluth) and University of Maryland 
(UMD). All the teams presented supervised systems 
which only used the tagged training data, and no 
other external resource. In particular, no system 
used the pointers to the full texts, or the additional 
untagged texts. All the systems used the lemma, 
PoS and case information provided, except the 
BCU team, which had additional access to number, 
determiner and ellipsis information directly from 
the analyzer. This extra information was not 
provided publicly because of representation issues.

Table 2: Results of systems and MFS baseline, ordered 
according to Recall. 
We want to note that due to a bug, a few examples 
were provided without lemmas.  
The results for the fine-grained scoring are 
shown in Table 2, including the Most Frequent 
Sense baseline (MFS). We will briefly describe 
each of the systems presented by each team in 
order of best recall.  
? Swat presented three systems based in the 
same set of features: the best one was based on 
Adaboost, the second on a combination of five 
learners (Adaboost, maximum entropy, 
clustering system based on cosine similarity, 
decision lists, and na?ve bayes, combined by 
majority voting), and the third on a 
combination of three systems (the last three).  
? BCU presented two systems: the first one based 
on Support Vector Machines (SVM) and the 
second on a majority-voting combination of 
SVM, cosine based vectors and na?ve bayes.  
? IRST participated with a kernel-based method. 
? Duluth participated with a system that votes 
among three bagged decision trees. 
? UMD presented a system based on SVM. 
The winning system is the one using Adaboost 
from Swat, followed closely by the BCU system 
using SVM. 
6 Discussion 
These are the main issues we think are 
interesting for further discussion. 
Sense inventory. Using the Basque WordNet 
presented some difficulties to the taggers. The 
Basque WordNet has been built using the 
translation approach, that is, the English synsets 
have been ?translated? into Basque. The taggers 
had some difficulties to comprehend synsets, and 
especially, to realize what makes a synset different 
from another. In some cases the taggers decided to 
group some of the senses, for instance, in herri ?
town/people/nation? they grouped 6 senses. This 
explains the relatively high number of tags per 
occurrence (1.34). The taggers think that the 
tagging would be much more satisfactory if they 
had defined the word senses directly from the 
corpus.  
Basque WordNet quality. There was a 
mismatch between the Basque WordNet and the 
corpus: most of the examples were linked to a 
specific genre, and this resulted in i) having a 
handful of senses in the Basque WordNet that did 
not appear in our corpus and ii) having some 
senses that were not included in the Basque 
WordNet. Fortunately, we already predicted this 
and we had a preparation phase where the editor 
enriched WordNet accordingly. Most of the 
deletions in the preliminary part were due to the 
semi-automatic method to construct the Basque 
WordNet. All in all, we think that tagging corpora 
is the best way to ensure the quality of the 
WordNets and we plan to pursue this extensively 
for the improvement of the Basque WordNet.  
7 Conclusions and future work 
5 teams participated in the Basque lexical-
sample task with 8 systems. All of the participants 
presented supervised systems which used lemma, 
PoS and case information provided, but none used 
the large amount of untagged senses provided by 
the organizers. The winning system attained 70.4 
recall. Regarding the organization of the task, we 
found that the taggers were more comfortable 
grouping some of the senses in the Basque 
WordNet. We also found that tagging word senses 
is essential for enriching and quality checking of 
the Basque WordNet.
