Abstract 
As the development of information 
technologies makes progress, large 
morphologically annotated corpora become 
a necessity, as they are necessary for 
moving onto higher levels of language 
computerisation (e. g. automatic syntactic 
and semantic analysis, information 
extraction, machine translation). Research 
of morphological disambiguation and 
morphological annotation of the 100 
million word Lithuanian corpus are 
presented in the article. Statistical methods 
have enabled to develop the automatic tool 
of morphological annotation for 
Lithuanian, with the disambiguation 
precision of 94%. Statistical data about the 
distribution of parts of speech, most 
frequent wordforms, and lemmas, in the 
annotated Corpus of The Contemporary 
Lithuanian Language is also presented. 
1 Introduction 
The goal of this paper is to present the experience 
and results of compiling a large Lithuanian 
morphologically annotated corpus by using an 
available Lithuanian morphological analyser and 
dealing with the disambiguation problem. 
The Corpus of the Contemporary Lithuanian 
Language is a database of electronic texts, which is 
widely used in Lithuania. It well represents the 
present Lithuanian language and its different 
varieties (more about that in http://donelaitis.vdu.lt/).

 Morphological annotation of the corpus will 
further increase capabilities of the corpus enabling 
extraction of unambiguous lexical and morpho-
logical information. The annotated corpus will 
soon be accessible for search on the internet. At the 
moment this corpus is fully accessible only at the 
Centre of Computational Linguistics of the 
Vytautas Magnus University. The tools for 
annotating Lithuanian texts are available for 
research purposes by request. 
The Lithuanian morphological analyser 
Lemuoklis (Zinkevi?ius, 2000) produces results of 
morphological analysis of Lithuanian wordforms, 
but leaves unsolved the problem of morphological 
ambiguity. Considering successful application of 
statistical methods in solving the morphological 
ambiguity for other languages, statistical methods 
have also been chosen for Lithuanian. Research of 
morphological disambiguation and results of 
morphological annotation of the 100 million word 
Lithuanian corpus are presented in the article.  
2 Morphological analysis of Lithuanian 
Morphologically ambiguous wordforms are words 
or wordforms that have two or more possible 
lemma interpretations or morphological annota-
tions, e. g. for the wordform kov? (en. fights, pl. 
Gen.) the morphological analyser Lemuoklis 
identifies two lemmas kovas (en. rook [bird] or 
March [month]) and kova (en. fight), while the 
wordform naktis (en. night) can be in Singular 
Nominative or in Plural Accusative case (more 
information on ambiguity for Lithuanian see 
Rimkut?, 2006). 
Approximately a half of all wordforms in the 
Lithuanian annotated corpus are morphologically 
ambiguous (Rimkut?, 2006), which is comparable 
to other inflected languages, e.g. for the Czech 
language it is 46% (Haji?, 2004:173). 
For developing the automatic disambiguation 
system a morphologically annotated training 
corpus is necessary. Manual creation of 1 M word 
Lithuanian annotated corpus is a very time consu-
ming task, which has taken 5 man-years to 
complete. Firstly, the annotation format needs to 
be developed and mastered (see Figure 1), then it is 
necessary to assign a word to an appropriate part of 
speech, and often it is very difficult to find a 
correct grammatical reading for a word. It also 
takes a lot of time reviewing and trying to put all 
annotated texts into one uniform standard. 
3 Automatic morphological annotation of 
the Lithuanian corpus 
Statistical morphological disambiguation using 
small manually annotated training corpora looks as 
quite a simple task, when frequencies of 
grammatical features are generated during the 
training phase and the most likely sequence of 
morphological features is found in a new text by 
the help of various probability methods. Drawing 
on the experience of morphological annotation 
systems for other free word order languages 
(D?bowski, 2004; Haji? et al, 2001; Palanisamy et 
al., 2006 etc.), it is obvious that the corpus-based 
method is most suitable for the developing such 
systems for Lithuanian.  
The Czech experience (Hladk?, 2000) was very 
expedient for developing automatic morphological 
annotation tool for Lithuanian, especially because 
Czech similarly to Lithuanian is a free word order 
language. Czech research applies statistical Hidden 
Markov Models and formal rule-based methods for 
Czech and English languages. It is important to 
note that these methods are language independent 
and can be applied to Lithuanian. The only 
language dependent factor is a small morpho-
logically annotated corpus for training. In various 
experiments the selection of Czech morphological 
features was regularized and optimised, which 
helped to achieve close to English language 
precision of 96%. However this precision is 
achieved with a limited number of Czech morpho-
logical features. The precision of 94 % is achieved 
when all features of Czech language are selected 
(Hladk?, 2000). 
4 Statistical morphological 
disambiguation 
Morphologically analysed words are the input of 
the automatic morphological annotation system, 
while the best sequence of morphological features 
is its output. Annotation of a new text involves 
establishing the most likely sequence of morpho-
logical features by the help of Hidden Markov 
models. Not all combinations of trigrams and 
bigrams can be found even in the biggest corpora. 
Therefore, the linear smoothing of the missing 
cases is used, as the probability of the most likely 
95
 sequence cannot be equal to zero (see more on 
HMM in Jurafsky (2000:305-307)).  
The following HMM model is used by Czech 
scientists: 
nttt

We expanded the model by including the 
lemma. This procedure is important to Lithuanian, 
where different lemmas often have identical 
wordforms and morphological features. Therefore 
the probability of a lemma is also included:

A function Count(x) corresponds to the 
frequency of a tag or a bigram.  
Smoothing lambdas 1w? , w? , 01? , 11? , 12? , 
21? , 22? , 23? < 1 are used to combine the 
probabilities of lower order. The smoothing is very 
important when unknown events occur in the 
training corpus.  
We used such lambda values: 
1w? =0.85, 
w? =0.85, 
01? =0.99, 
11? =0.74, 12? =0.25, 
21? =0.743, 22? =0.203, 23? =0.053 
96
 If a trigram tag is not found in the training 
corpus then the probability of a trigram is not 
assigned to zero, but rather the probability of a 
bigram is included with some weight. In case no 
trigram tag, bigram tag and unigram tag is found 
then the probability of a trigram assumes a very 
small number which is equal to 1 divided by the 
size of the tagset. The highest score is assigned to a 
trigram, lower ? to bigram, and lowest ? unigram.  
The disambiguation tool has been developed at the 
Centre of Computational Linguistics of the 
Vytautas Magnus University using C++ tools. All 
results reported in this paper are based on approach 
using an accuracy criterion (number of correctly 
disambiguated results divided by number of input 
words). We do not use any morphological pre-
processing. A precision of 94% has been achieved 
for establishing tags, which is comparable to 
results achieved for other languages, when the 1 
million word training corpus is used. A precision 
of 99% is achieved for establishing lemmas. For 
the precision test a special 50 thousand word 
corpus has been used, which is not included in the 
training corpus. 
The following statistics has been derived from 
the 1 M word training corpus1:  
 
Different lemmas   41,408 
Different pairs of wordforms 
and tags  
 130,511 
Different pairs of wordforms 
and lemmas  
 121,634

Bigram tags   76,312 
Trigram tags   544,922 
Training corpus size | |  trainT  1,009,516 
Table 1: Corpus statistics 
 
The number of lemmas in the training corpus is 
sufficient to gather frequencies in order to solve 
ambiguous lemmas. Unknown lemmas are not 
ambiguous in the training corpus, as they are rare 
and have unique meanings. 
The size of the tagset is 1449. Lithuanian is a 
relatively free word order language, and therefore 
it is difficult to get reliable bigram and trigram 
statistics. We decided to gather distant bigram and 
                                                 
1 See more about manually tagged Lithuanian Corpus 
and Lithuanian language tagset in Zinkevi?ius et al 
2005. 
trigram frequencies using a gap of 1. As a bigram 
we consider two subsequent tags (<A> <B>) or 
two tags with a gap of 1 in between (<A> <gap> 
<B>). Similarly, a trigram is a sequence of three 
subsequent tags (<A> <B> <C>) or a sequence of 
three tags with a gap of 1 between the first and 
second tag (<A> <gap> <B> <C>) or between the 
second and third tag (<A> <B> <gap> <C>). 
Distant n-grams help to reduce the number of 
unknown bigrams and trigrams in the training 
corpus. 
5 Statistical data for the morphologically 
annotated corpus of Lithuanian 
Most important statistical data for the 
morphologically annotated Lithuanian corpus: 
? Corpus size ? 111,745,938 running words; 
? Number of wordforms ? 1,830,278; 
? Number of unrecognized wordforms ? 
824,387 (5,6 % of all tokens); 
? Number of recognized wordforms ? 
1,005,891. 
225,319 different lemmas have been recognized 
in the Corpus of Contemporary Lithuanian. 
Distribution of parts of speech in the whole 100 
M word corpus does not differ significantly from 
the distribution in the training corpus (see Figure 
2). The biggest difference is in the number of 
unknown words. There are no unknown words in 
the training corpus, because it has been semi-
automatically annotated and disambiguated. The 
number of unknown words in the 100 M word 
corpus is influenced by morphological analyzer, 
i.e., not all words are successfully recognized.  
A big part of unknown words are proper nouns. 
Presently the dictionary of the morphological 
analyser contains 5255 high frequency proper noun 
lemmas (e.g. Lietuva (en. Lithuania)), which 
account for 3.2% of the vocabulary in the large 
annotated corpus. In the training corpus proper 
nouns account for 4.3% of the vocabulary, and we 
expect the similar proportion in the large annotated 
corpus. The average frequency of a proper noun 
lemma is 4.6 in the training corpus. Thus we could 
estimate the size of the dictionary of proper nouns 
at about 250,000 lemmas. 
 
97
 6 The remaining problems 
The achieved precision of 94% for morphological 
annotation leaves some room for improvement. It 
is still difficult to solve homographic problems, 
where some wordforms of different words are 
identical. For example, wrong lemmas are 
frequently chosen for the wordforms tonas (en. 
tone) and tona (en. ton), kovas (en. rook [bird]) and 
kova (en. fight), Bir?ai (Lithuanian town) and bir?a 
(en. stock-market). 
Syncretism of grammatical cases is not always 
solved correctly. Most often the incorrect analysis 
is given for words of feminine gender, when 
singular Genitive and plural Nominative cases are 
confused (e. g. mokyklos (en. school)). 
Some cases are problematic even for a human 
linguist, when it is not clear which part of speech 
(noun or verb) is used in such collocations: kovos 
d?l teis?s likti pirmajame e?elone (lit. fight/ fights 
for the right to stay in the first league); kovos su 
narkotikais (lit. fight/ fights against drugs); kovos 
su okupantais (lit. fight/ fights against occupants). 
Even if the part of speech of the word kovos is 
chosen as a noun, then the ambiguity case still 
remains. The broader context is needed to solve 
such problems. 
Interjections are not very often used in 
Lithuanian, nevertheless the morphological abbre-
viation a is confused with the interjection a. 
Abbreviations that are identical to Roman 
numerals are often annotated incorrectly: the most 
problems are caused by the abbreviation V. 
Sometimes wrong lemma is chosen. The words 
with fixed forms such as ir (en. and), tik (en. only) 
cause many problems as they can be interjections, 
particles, or adverbs. The lemma of the wordform 
vienas (en. one, alone, single) is not always chosen 
correctly, as this word can be a pronoun, an 
adjective, a numeral, or even a proper noun. It is 
hoped that some of these problems will disappear 
after improving the program of morphological 
analysis. 
7 Conclusions 
The method of Hidden Markov models for 
morphological annotation has allowed achieving 
the precision of 94%, which is comparable to the 
precision achieved for other languages, when 1 M 
word training corpus is used. The precision of 99% 
is achieved for establishing lemmas of Lithuanian 
words. The precision measure estimates only the 
process of disambiguation, while unrecognised 
words are not included in the precision test. 
The amount of unrecognised wordforms makes 
up 5,6% of all tokens (more that 800,000 different 
wordforms). In order to analyse the missing 
wordforms around 100-150 thousand lemmas need 
to be added to the lexicon of morphological

size of the lexicon. 
One million word morphologically annotated 
corpus is enough for the analysis of morphological 
phenomena in Lithuanian, as distribution of parts 
of speech in the 100 million word corpus does not 
differ significantly
