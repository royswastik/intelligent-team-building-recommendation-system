Abstract
The Italian lexical sample task at
SENSEVAL-3 provided a framework to
evaluate supervised and semi-supervised
WSD systems. This paper reports on the
task preparation ? which offered the op-
portunity to review and refine the Italian
MultiWordNet ? and on the results of the
six participants, focussing on both the
manual and automatic tagging procedures.
1 Introduction
The task consisted in automatically determining
the correct meaning of a word within a given con-
text (i.e. a short text snippet). Systems? results
were compared on the one hand to those achieved
by human annotators (upper bound), and on the
other hand to those returned by a basic algorithm
(baseline).
In the second section of this paper an overview
of the task preparation is given and in the follow-
ing one the main features of the participating sys-
tems are briefly outlined and the results of the
evaluation exercise are presented.
In the conclusions we give an overall judgement
of the outcome of the task, suggesting possible im-
provements for the next campaign.
2 Manual Annotation
A collection of manually labeled instances was
built for three main reasons:
1. automatic evaluation (using the Scorer2 pro-
gram) required a Gold Standard list of senses
provided by human annotators;
2. supervised WSD systems need a labeled set of
training data, that in our case was twice larger
than the test set;
3. manual semantic annotation is a time-
consuming activity, but SENSEVAL repre-
sents the framework to build reusable bench-
mark resources. Besides, manual sense tagging
entails the revision of the sense inventory,
whose granularity does not always satisfy an-
notators.
2.1 Corpus and Words Choice
The document collection from which the anno-
tators selected the text snippets containing the
lemmata to disambiguate was the macro-balanced
section of the Meaning Italian Corpus (Bentivogli
et al, 2003). This corpus is an open domain col-
lection of newspaper articles that contains about 90
million tokens covering a time-spam of 4 years
(1998-2001). The corpus was indexed in order to
browse it with the Toolbox for Lexicographers
(Giuliano, 2002), a concordancer that enables tag-
gers to highlight the occurrences of a token within
a context.
Two taggers chose 45 lexical entries (25 nouns,
10 adjectives and 10 verbs) according to their
polysemy in the sense inventory, their polysemy in
the corpus and their frequency (Edmonds, 2000).
The words that had already been used at
SENSEVAL-2 were avoided. Ten words were
shared with the Spanish, Catalan and Basque lexi-
cal sample tasks.
Annotators were provided with a formula that
indicated the number of labeled instances for each
lemma1, so they checked that the words were con-
1 No. of labeled instances for each lemma = 75 + (15*no. of attested senses) +
(7* no. of attested multiwords), where 75 is a fixed number of examples distrib-
uted over all the attested senses.

siderably frequent and polysemous before starting
to tag and save the instances.
As a result, average polysemy attested in the la-
beled data turned out to be quite high: six senses
for the nouns, six for the adjectives and seven for
the verbs.
2.2 Sense Inventory and Manual Tagging
Differently from the Italian lexical sample task
at SENSEVAL-2, where the instances were tagged
according to ItalWordNet (Calzolari et al, 2002),
this year annotators used the Italian MultiWord-
Net, (hereafter MWN) developed at ITC-Irst (Pi-
anta, 2002). This lexical-semantic database
includes about 42,000 lemmata and 60,000 word
senses, corresponding to 34,000 synsets. Instead of
distributing to participants the senses of each
lemma and a limited hierarchical data structure of
the semantic relations of the senses (as happened at
SENSEVAL-2), the entire resource was made
available. Nevertheless, none of the six participat-
ing systems, being supervised, actually needed
MWN.
The annotators? task was to tag one occurrence
of each selected word in all the saved instances,
assigning only one sense drawn from the Italian
MWN. The Toolbox for Lexicographers enabled
annotators to browse the document collection and
to save the relevant text snippets, while a graphical
interface2 was used to annotate the occurrences,
storing them in a database. Generally, instances
consisted of the sentence containing the ambiguous
lemma, with a preceding and a following sentence.
Nevertheless, annotators tended to save the mini-
mal piece of information that a human would need
to disambiguate the lemma, which was often
shorter than three sentences.
The two annotators were involved simultane-
ously: firstly, each of them saved a part of the in-
stances and tagged the occurrences, secondly they
tagged the examples that had been chosen by the
other one.
More importantly, they interacted with a lexi-
cographer, who reviewed the sense inventory
whenever they encountered difficulties. Sometimes
there was an overlap between two or more word
senses, while in other cases MWN needed to be
enriched, adding new synsets, relations or defini-

tions. All the 45 lexical entries we considered were
thoroughly reviewed, so that word senses were as
clear as possible to the annotators. On the one
hand, the revision of MWN made manual tagging
easier, while on the other hand it led to a high Inter
Tagger Agreement (that ranged between 73 and 99
per cent), consequently reflected in the K statistics
(that ranged between 0.68 and 0.99).
Table 1 below summarizes the results of the
manual tagging.
Table 1. Manual Annotation Results
Once the instances had been collected and
tagged by both the annotators, we asked them to
discuss the examples about which they disagreed
and to find a definitive meaning for them.
Since the annotators built the corpus while tag-
ging, they tended to choose occurrences whose
meaning was immediately straightforward, avoid-
ing problematic cases. As a consequence, the ITA
turned out to be so high and the distribution of the
senses in the labeled data set did not reflect the
actual frequency in the Italian language, which
may have affected the systems? performance.
Annotators assigned different senses to 674 in-
stances over a total of 7584 labeled examples.
Generally, disagreement depended on trivial mis-
takes, and in most cases one of the two assigned
meanings was chosen as the final one. Neverthe-
less, in 46 cases the third and last annotation was
different from the previous two, which could dem-
onstrate that a few word senses were not com-
pletely straightforward even after the revision of
the sense inventory.
For example, the following instance for the
lemma ?vertice? (vertex, acme, peak) was anno-
tated in three different ways:
La struttura lavorativa ? spiega Grandi ? ha un carattere paramilita-
re. Al vertice della piramide c?? il direttore, poi i manager, quelli con
la cravatta e la camicia a mezze maniche.
Annotator 1 tagged with sense 2 (Factotum,
?the highest point of something?), while annotator
2 decided for sense 4 (Geometry, ?the point of in-

pyramid. Actually, the snippet reported this ab-
stract image to describe the structure of an enter-
prise, so in the end the two taggers opted for sense
5 (Administration, ?the group of the executives of
a corporation?). Therefore, subjectivity in manual
tagging was considerably reduced by adjusting the
sense repository and selecting manually each sin-
gle instance, but it could not be eliminated.
3 Automatic Annotation
We provided participants with three data sets:
labeled training data (twice larger than the test set),
unlabeled training data (about 10 times the labeled
instances) and test data. In order to facilitate par-
ticipation, we PoS-tagged the labeled data sets us-
ing an Italian version of the TnT PoS-tagger
(Brants, 2000), trained on the Elsnet corpus.
3.1 Participants? results
Three groups participated in the Italian lexical
sample task, testing six systems: two developed by
ITC-Irst - Italy - (IRST-Kernels and IRST-Ties),
three by Swarthmore College - U.S.A. - (swat-hk-
italian, Italian-swat_hk-bo and swat-italian) and
one by UNED - Spain.
Table 2 below reports the participants? results,
sorted by F-measure.

IRST-Kernels 0.531 0.531 100% 0.531
swat-hk-italian 0.515 0.515 100% 0.515
UNED 0.498 0.498 100% 0.498

IRST-Ties 0.552 0.309 55.92% 0.396
baseline 0.183 0.183 100% 0.183
Table 2. Automatic Annotation Results (fine-grained score)
The baseline results were obtained running a sim-
ple algorithm that assigned to the instances of the
test set the most frequent sense of each lemma in
the training set. All the systems outperformed the
baseline and obtained similar results. Compared to
the baseline of the other Lexical Sample tasks, ours
is much lower because we interpreted the formula
described above (see footnote 1), and tagged the
same number of instances for all the senses of each
lemma disregarding their frequency in the docu-
ment collection. As a result, the distribution of the
examples over the attested senses did not reflect
the one in natural language, which may have af-
fected the systems? performance.
While at SENSEVAL-2 test set senses were
clustered in order to compute mixed- and coarse-
grained scores, this year we decided to return just
the fine-grained measure, where an automatically
tagged instance is correct only if the sense corre-
sponds to the one assigned by humans, and wrong
otherwise (i.e. one-to-one mapping).
There are different sense clustering methods,
but grouping meanings according to some sort of
similarity is always an arbitrary decision. We in-
tended to calculate a domain-based coarse-grained
score, where word senses were clustered according
to the domain information provided in WordNet
Domains (Magnini and Cavagli?, 2000). Unfortu-
nately, this approach would have been significant
with nouns, but not with adjectives and verbs, that
belong mostly to the generic Factotum domain, so
we discarded the idea.
All the six participating systems were super-
vised, which means they all used the training data
set and no one utilized either unlabelled instances
or the lexical database. UNED used also SemCor
as an additional source of training examples.
IRST-Kernels system exploited Kernel methods
for pattern abstraction and combination of different
knowledge sources, in particular paradigmatic and
syntagmatic information, and achieved the best F-
measure score.
IRST-Ties, a generalized pattern abstraction
system originally developed for Information Ex-
traction tasks and mainly based on the boosted
wrapper induction algorithm, used only lemma and
POS as features. Proposed as a ?baseline? system
to discover syntagmatic patterns, it obtained a quite
low recall (about 55 per cent), which affected the
F-measure, but proved to be the most precise sys-
tem.
Swarthmore College wrote three supervised
classifiers: a clustering system based on cosine
similarity, a decision list system and a naive bayes
classifier. Besides, Swarthmore group took advan-
tage of two systems developed at the Hong Kong
Polytechnic University: a maximum entropy classi-
fier and system which used boosting (Italian-
swat_hk-bo). The run swat-hk-italian joined all the
five classifiers according to a simple majority-vote
scheme, while swat-hk-italian did the same using
only the three classifiers developed in Swarthmore.
The system presented by the UNED group em-
ployed similarity as a learning paradigm, consid-
ering the co-occurrence of different nouns and
adjectives.
3.2 General Remarks on Task Complexity
As we mentioned above, the 45 words for the
Italian lexical sample task were chosen according
to their polysemy and frequency. We addressed
difficult words, that had at least 5 senses in MWN.
Actually, polysemy does not seem to be directly
related to systems? results (Calzolari, 2002), in fact
the average F-measure of our six runs for the
nouns (0.512) was higher than for adjectives
(0.472) and verbs (0.448), although the former had
more attested senses in the labeled data.
Complexity in returning the correct sense seems
to depend on the blurred distinction between simi-
lar meanings rather than on the number of senses
themselves. If we consider the nouns ?attacco?
(attack) and ?esecuzione? (performance, execu-
tion), for which the systems obtained the worst and
one of the best average results respectively, we
notice that the 4 attested senses of ?esecuzione?
were clearly distinguished and referred to different
domains (Factotum, Art, Law and Politics), while
the 6 attested senses of ?attacco? were more subtly
defined. Senses 2, 7 and 11 were very difficult to
discriminate and often appeared in metaphorical
contexts. Senses 5 and 6, for their part, belong to
the Sport domain and are not always easy to dis-
tinguish.
4 Conclusions
The results of the six systems participating in
the evaluation exercise showed some improve-
ments compared to the average performance at
SENSEVAL-2, though data sets and sense reposi-
tories were considerably different.
We are pleased with the successful outcome of
the experiments in terms of participation, although
regrettably no system exploited the unlabeled
training set, which was intended to offer a less
time-consuming resource. On the other hand, the
labeled instances that have been collected represent
a useful and reusable benchmark.
As a final remark we think it could be interest-
ing to consider the actual distribution of word
senses in Italian corpora in collecting the examples
for the next campaign.
