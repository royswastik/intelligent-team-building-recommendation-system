Abstract 
A full understanding of text is out of reach of 
current human language technology. However, a 
shallow Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
approach can be used to provide automated help in 
the evaluation of essays. The main idea of this 
paper is that Latent Semantic Indexing (LSA) can 
be used in conjunction with ontologies and First 
order Logic (FOL) to locate segments relevant to a 
question in a student essay. Our test bed, in a first 
instance, is a set of ontologies such the AKT 
reference ontology (describing academic life), 
Newspaper and a Koala ontology (concerning 
koalas? habitat). 
1 Introduction 
This paper describes a novel methodology 
aiming to support evaluators during the essay 
marking process. This approach allows measuring 
semantic similarity between structured (i.e. 
ontology and binary relations derived from the 
essay question) and unstructured (i.e. text 
processed as a bag of words) information by means 
of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and the cosine 
similarity measure (Deewerster et al, 1990). 
  
Previous studies (Foltz et al, 1998; Wiemer-
Hastings and Graesser, 1999) have used LSA to 
measure text coherence and comprehension by 
comparing units of text (i.e. sentences, terms or 
paragraphs) to determine how semantically related 
they are. The work presented in this paper  is based 
on the use of ?pseudo? documents: these are 
temporary documents containing a description of  
knowledge entities extracted from available 
domain ontologies (i.e. ontological relations). Both 
pseudo documents and paragraphs in student 
essays are represented as vectors. Essay paragraphs 
are indexed according to a measure of semantic 
similarity (called cosine similarity). The 
ontological space acts as a mediated schema, a set 
of virtual relations among knowledge entities 
related by their degree of similarity. A new 
knowledge entity can be added in this space and 
automatically a similarity measure is calculated for 
all the entities within the space.  
1.1 Motivation and Context 
The main motivation for this work derives from 
a need for semantics in essay evaluation, whether 
by a tutor or by the student author in the process of 
writing. Page (Page, 1968) makes a useful 
distinction between marking for syntax (i.e. 
linguistic style) and for content (subject matter) 
which we will use in our outline. Based on this 
distinction, four main approaches to essay 
assessment have been reported (Williams, 2001). 
Early systems such as PEG (Page, 1966) relied 
mainly on syntactic and linguistic features and 
required a sample of the essays to be marked by a 
number of human judges. E-rater (Burstein et al, 
1998) uses a combination of statistical and natural 
language processing techniques for the purpose of 
extracting linguistic features of the essays to be 
graded. Again, the essays are evaluated against a 
set of human?graded essays acting as a benchmark. 
In the LSA method of essay grading, an LSA space 
is constructed based on domain specific material 
and the student essays. LSA grading performance 
is about as reliable as human graders (Foltz, 1996). 
Text categorisation (Larkey, 1998) also requires a 
database of graded essays, so that new essays can 
be categorised in relation to them.  
 
In short, the approaches seen so far 1 have either 
concentrated on syntactic and linguistic features or 
used domain knowledge in the form of keywords 
and documents about the domain. What we are 
proposing in this paper is that a further distinction 
should be made between using implicit (keywords, 
documents) and explicit content representations 
(see Fig.1, our contribution is marked in bold). We 
                                                     
1 Kukich presents in her article Beyond Automated 
Essay Scoring  a time line of research developments in 
the field of writing evaluation (Kukich, 2000). 
 
then argue the case for adding explicit domain 
knowledge in the form of domain ontologies. In 
particular, we merge ontologies, LSA and FOL. An 
advantage of this approach is that it does not 
require a corpus of graded essays, except for 
validation. This feature enables tutors (or students 
in need of feedback) to evaluate essays on 
particular topics even when there are no pre-scored 
essay examples available. Effectively, this 
capability may reduce the overall time required to 
prepare a reliable evaluation scheme for a new 
essay question.

2 LSA and the Cosine Similarity 
In the vector space model, a term-to-document 
matrix is built in which the entries are weighted 
frequencies of pre-processed terms occurring in a 
collection of documents. Dimension reduction 
methods (such as LSA), when applied to the 
semantic vector space model, improve information 
retrieval, information filtering and word sense 
disambiguation. The reduction in dimensions 
reduces the noise in text categorisation, reduces the 
computational complexity of cluster creation, and 
produces the best statistical approximation to the 
original vector space model. Likelihood curves 
characterise with a quantity the level of 
significance of the reduced model dimensions. 
Also, the significance of each dimension follows a 
Zipf distribution (Li, 1992) indicating that the 
reduced model dimensions represent latent 
concepts (Ding, 1999). The dimensions in the 
reduced vector space model can be compared 
measuring semantic similarity between each of 
them by means of the cosine similarity. The cosine 
of the angle between two vectors is defined as the 
inner product between the vectors v and w divided 
by the product of the length of the two vectors.

3 Indexing Essays Paragraphs 
An index of relations within the ontologies 
related to the semantic space is obtained for each 
binary relation derived from the essay question. 
Then a subset containing the higher ranked 
relations is selected and the similarity between 
each of the relations in the subset and all the 
documents containing essays paragraphs is also 
calculated by applying LSA. Finally, an average 
similarity value is obtained for the paragraph over 
the number of relations in the subset. 
3.1 An Ontology Integration Method to Build 
the Semantic Space 
A collection of ?pseudo? documents is created 
for each of the classes within the ontologies 
describing the domains tackled in the essay. The 
ontologies are described quantitatively using 
probabilistic knowledge (Florescu et al, 1997). 
 
Each of these documents contains information 
(name, properties and relations) about a class. The 
documents are represented by a vector space model 
(Salton et al, 1971) where each column in the 
term-to-document matrix represents the ontological 
classes and the rows represent terms occurring in 
the pseudo documents describing those knowledge 
entities. 
 
Relations within the available ontologies are also 
represented by a vector space model where the 
columns in the term?to?document matrix are a 
combination of two or more vectors from the term?
to?document matrix representing classes. Each 
column represents the relation held between the 
combined classes. A new column representing the 
binary relation derived from the essay question is 
added to the new matrix: this new column contains 
the weighted frequencies of terms appearing as 
arguments within the relation. For each essay 
question, one or more binary relations are derived 
through parsing. For instance: given the query ?Do 
koalas live in the jungle?? the binary relation is 
live_in (koala, jungle). In the case of this example, 
the vector representing the question contains a 
frequency of one in the rows corresponding to the 
terms koala and jungle.  
 
LSA is applied to the term?to?document matrix 
representing the ontological relations, the vector 
space model is reduced and the cosine similarity is 
calculated to obtain the semantic similarity 
between the vectors of the reduced space model. 
For each column, a ranking of similarity with the 
rest of the columns will be obtained.

4 Experiments on semantic similarity  
In order to evaluate how well LSA captures 
similarity, this section will describe three 
preliminary experiments for measuring semantic 
similarity between knowledge entities (i.e. binary 
relations and classes) of three different ontologies, 
the Aktive Portal Ontology (APO), the Koala 
Ontology (KO) and the Newspaper Ontology 
(NO). 
4.1 Experiment 1 
The aim of this experiment is to evaluate how 
well LSA captures similarity between classes that 
belong to different ontologies. Eight classes have 
been selected randomly from within three 
ontologies and described in ?pseudo? documents. 
The words included in each of the documents 
correspond to the names of the classes and slots 
related to the class described. The terms have been 
stemmed and stop words deleted before applying 
LSA to the term?to?document matrix built using 
the weighted frequencies of the term occurring 
within the eight documents describing the classes. 
Terms have been weighted according to the 
weighting scheme presented in section 2.1.1 with 
dj=1, the only difference being that terms 
corresponding to classes names have been 
multiplied by two. The similarity measures for the 
eight classes are obtained (See Table 1) after 
applying LSA with a rank of two and the cosine 
similarity measure to the term?to?document 
matrix.  
 
The results from this experiment show that, in 
terms of the cosine similarity measure, the class 
?Researcher? appears to be very similar to the class 
?Student? in a different ontology. The same results 
also show that the two classes ?Newspaper? 
belonging to two different ontologies are very 
similar to each other.  
4.2 Experiment 2 
The aim of this experiment is to evaluate the 
ability of LSA to measure similarity between a 
predicate argument and different classes. The 
query is represented as an added column in the 
term?to?document matrix which already contains 
as columns the same documents representing the 
eight classes used in the first experiment. The 
column representing the query argument contains 
only one term corresponding to the name of one of 
the classes within the ontologies used in this 
experiment. The frequency of this term is the entry 
in the added column with a frequency of one 
multiplied by two as all the other terms 
representing names of classes.  The results for the 
cosine similarity measure between the eight classes 
plus the query containing the term ?student?, 
?newspaper? and ?animal? after applying LSA  
with a rank of four (see Table 2) indicate that the 
most similar classes for the query containing the 
 
term ?student? are the following classes:  
?Student? from KO, ?Researcher? from APO, and 
?Parent? from KO.

1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 Queries 
Table 2 ? Semantic similarity between arguments 
and classes belonging to different ontologies 
 
For the query containing the term ?newspaper? 
the results shows that the most similar classes are 
?Newspaper? from APO, ?Newspaper? from NO 
and ?Standard Advertising? also from NO.  
Finally, for the query containing the term 
?animal?, the most similar classes in order of 
similarity closeness are ?Parent? from KO and 
?Koala? also from KO.  
 
 The results of this experiment indicate that LSI 
may be accurately used as a measure of similarity 
between a keyword representing a query predicate 
argument and a set of documents representing 
classes that belong to a set of different available 
ontologies.   
4.3 Experiment 3 
The aim of this experiment is to evaluate the 
cosine similarity measure as a measure of semantic 
similarity between binary relations derived from a 
question or query and relations held between two 
classes. This measure is based on the same 
methodology and procedures applied to both 
experiments described above. For this experiment, 
eighteen classes have been selected arbitrarily from 
the three available ontologies (see Table 3).   
 
The binary relations held among the selected 
classes are represented as documents in a term?to? 
document matrix that is the union of the two    
pseudo documents describing the related classes. 
Following the same procedure as in the previous 
experiment, a new column representing the binary 
relation derived from a question is added to the 
matrix, but in this case it contains the terms 
describing the two arguments of the binary 
relation.

Table 3 ? Ontological Binary Relations (OBR) 
used in Experiment 3    
 
The cosine similarity between fifteen predicates 
and the available relations after applying LSA with 
a rank of four (see Table 4) show that, in eight of 
the fifteen cases, the similarity value is higher for 
the relations held between classes than between 
predicate arguments. In the rest of the cases, the 
similarity values are very close for two or more 
relations including the one held between classes 
that are the same as the predicate arguments. 
Another interesting observation is that, Question 
Binary Relation 3 (QBR3) has a cosine value more 
similar to Ontological Binary Relation 9 (OBR9), 
OBR3 and OBR4. In the case of QBR5, the cosine 
value is higher when measuring similarity with 
OBR11 and OBR12 than, for example, the cosine 
value when measuring similarity with  OBR3 and 
OBR4. Similar results were obtained for QBR6 
where, apart from OBR6, OBR9 has the cosine 
value closest to one. Other similar results are 
obtained for QBR11 and QBR12 where OBR5 is 
closer to a value of one than OBR7, OBR8 and 
OBR9.

Table 4 ?Cosine similarity between the Question Binary Relations (QBR) and the Ontological Binary 
Relations (OBR).  
 
The results of this experiment indicate that the 
presented methodology is able to detect similarity 
between compact representations (binary relation 
arguments) and more expanded representations 
such as the pseudo documents representing the 
binary relations within the three available 
ontologies.  
4.4 Experiments discussion  
We expect that using LSA together with the 
cosine similarity measure, we will be able to pick 
up semantic similarity between the compacted and 
expanded representations of the binary relation and 
paragraphs from student essays. The main 
difference between our approach and other essay 
scoring approaches (e.g. The Intelligent Essay 
Assessor; Laundauer et al, 2000) where the scores 
are calibrated using LSA with pre-scored essay 
examples, is that our approach scores paragraphs 
using LSA and the cosine similarity with 
ontologies describing the essay domain. The 
experiment results in the previous sections validate 
our view showing that the cosine similarity may be 
used as a reliable score for semantic similarity 
between knowledge entities belonging to different 
data sources (i.e. terms, classes and binary 
relations). 
5 Conclusion and Future Work  
This paper introduces the idea of ?explicit 
content? and its use in essay evaluation. The main 
contribution of the paper is then the idea that 
ontologies and First Order Logic (FOL) can be 
used together with LSA to locate segments 
relevant to a question in a student essay.   
 
Our main interest is to provide help to tutors in 
grading and to students for feedback purposes. In 
fact, even outside the realms of grading, we believe 
that it will help annotate and rank paragraphs more 
relevant to queries. In our proposal, we went about 
doing this supplementing the widely-used LSA 
method with added semantics (ontologies) and 
First Order Logic (FOL). Our approach therefore 
attempts to bridge the gap between statistical and 
semantic approaches. 
  
There is clearly a lot more work needed to make 
this technology work well enough for large-scale 
deployment. Further work may include a 
visualisation service that also provides a 
visualisation of annotation of segments relevant to 
the current question types around the lines of the 
work described in (Moreale and Vargas-Vera, 
2003; Moreale and Vargas-Vera, 2004).
