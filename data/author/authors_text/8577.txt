Abstract
In this paper, a generic system that gener-
ates parsers from parsing schemata is ap-
plied to the particular case of the XTAG
English grammar. In order to be able to
generate XTAG parsers, some transforma-
tions are made to the grammar, and TAG
parsing schemata are extended with fea-
ture structure unification support and a
simple tree filtering mechanism. The gen-
erated implementations allow us to study
the performance of different TAG parsers
when working with a large-scale, wide-
coverage grammar.
1 Introduction
Since Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG) were in-
troduced, several different parsing algorithms for
these grammars have been developed, each with
its peculiar characteristics. Identifying the advan-
tages and disadvantages of each of them is not
trivial, and there are no comparative studies be-
tween them in the literature that work with real-
life, wide coverage grammars. In this paper, we
use a generic tool based on parsing schemata to
generate implementations of several TAG parsers
and compare them by parsing with the XTAG En-
glish Grammar (XTAG, 2001).
The parsing schemata formalism (Sikkel, 1997)
is a framework that allows us to describe parsers in
a simple and declarative way. A parsing schema

is a representation of a parsing algorithm as a
set of inference rules which are used to perform
deductions on intermediate results called items.
These items represent sets of incomplete parse
trees which the algorithm can generate. An input
sentence to be analyzed produces an initial set of
items. Additionally, a parsing schema must de-
fine a criterion to determine which items are final,
i.e. which items correspond to complete parses of
the input sentence. If it is possible to obtain a fi-
nal item from the set of initial items by using the
schema?s inference rules (called deductive steps),
then the input sentence belongs to the language de-
fined by the grammar. The parse forest can then be
retrieved from the intermediate items used to infer
the final items, as in (Billot and Lang, 1989).
As an example, we introduce a CYK-based
algorithm (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1985) for
TAG. Given a tree adjoining grammar G =
(VT , VN , S, I, A)1 and a sentence of length n
which we denote by a1 a2 . . . an2, we de-
note by P (G) the set of productions {N? ?
N?1 N
?
2 . . . N?r } such that N? is an inner node of
a tree ? ? (I ? A), and N?1 N
?
2 . . . N?r is the or-
dered sequence of direct children of N? .
The parsing schema for the TAG CYK-based
algorithm (Alonso et al, 1999) is a function that
maps such a grammar G to a deduction system
whose domain is the set of items
{[N? , i, j, p, q, adj]}
verifying that N? is a tree node in an elementary
1Where VT denotes the set of terminal symbols, VN the
set of nonterminal symbols, S the axiom, I the set of initial
trees and A the set of auxiliary trees.
2From now on, we will follow the usual conventions by
which nonterminal symbols are represented by uppercase let-
ters (A, B . . .), and terminals by lowercase letters (a, b . . .).
Greek letters (?, ?...) will be used to represent trees, N? a
node in the tree ?, and R? the root node of the tree ?.
103
tree ? ? (I ? A), i and j (0 ? i ? j) are string
positions, p and q may be undefined or instanti-
ated to positions i ? p ? q ? j (the latter only
when ? ? A), and adj ? {true, false} indi-
cates whether an adjunction has been performed
on node N? .
The positions i and j indicate that a substring
ai+1 . . . aj of the string is being recognized, and
positions p and q denote the substring dominated
by ??s foot node. The final item set would be
{[R?, 0, n,?,?, adj] | ? ? I}
for the presence of such an item would indicate
that there exists a valid parse tree with yield a1 a2
. . . an and rooted at R?, the root of an initial tree;
and therefore there exists a complete parse tree for
the sentence.
A deductive step ?1...?m? ? allows us to infer
the item specified by its consequent ? from those
in its antecedents ?1 . . . ?m. Side conditions (?)
specify the valid values for the variables appearing
in the antecedents and consequent, and may refer
to grammar rules or specify other constraints that
must be verified in order to infer the consequent.
The deductive steps for our CYK-based parser are
shown in figure 1. The steps DScanCYK and D?CYK are
used to start the bottom-up parsing process by rec-
ognizing a terminal symbol for the input string, or
none if we are using a tree with an epsilon node.
The DBinaryCYK step (where the operation p ? p? re-
turns p if p is defined, and p? otherwise) represents
the bottom-up parsing operation which joins two
subtrees into one, and is analogous to one of the
deductive steps of the CYK parser for CFG. The
DUnaryCYK step is used to handle unary branching pro-
ductions. DFootCYK and D
Adj
CYK implement the adjunc-
tion operation, where a tree ? is adjoined into a
node N? ; their side condition ? ? adj(N?) means
that ? must be adjoinable into the node N? (which
involves checking that N? is an adjunction node,
comparing its label to R??s and verifying that no
adjunction constraint disallows the operation). Fi-
nally, the DSubsCYK step implements the substitution
operation in grammars supporting it.
As can be seen from the example, parsing
schemata are simple, high-level descriptions that
convey the fundamental semantics of parsing algo-
rithms while abstracting implementation details:
they define a set of possible intermediate results
and allowed operations on them, but they don?t
specify data structures for storing the results or an
order for the operations to be executed. This high
abstraction level makes schemata useful for defin-
ing, comparing and analyzing parsers in pencil and
paper without worrying about implementation de-
tails. However, if we want to actually execute
the parsers and analyze their results and perfor-
mance in a computer, they must be implemented
in a programming language, making it necessary
to lose the high level of abstraction in order to ob-
tain functional and efficient implementations.
In order to bridge this gap between theory and
practice, we have designed and implemented a
system able to automatically transform parsing
schemata into efficient Java implementations of
their corresponding algorithms. The input to this
system is a simple and declarative representation
of a parsing schema, which is practically equal to
the formal notation that we used previously. For
example, this is the DBinaryCYK deductive step shown
in figure 1 in a format readable by our compiler:
@step CYKBinary
[ Node1 , i , k , p , q , adj1 ]
[ Node2 , k , j , p? , q? , adj2 ]
-------------------------------- Node3 -> Node1 Node2
[ Node3 , i , j , Union(p;p?) , Union(q;q?) , false ]
The parsing schemata compilation technique
used by our system is based on the following fun-
damental ideas (Go?mez-Rodr??guez et al, 2006a):
? Each deductive step is compiled to a Java class
containing code to match and search for an-
tecedent items and generate the corresponding
conclusions from the consequent.
? The step classes are coordinated by a deduc-
tive parsing engine, as the one described in
(Shieber et al, 1995). This algorithm ensures
a sound and complete deduction process, guar-
anteeing that all items that can be generated
from the initial items will be obtained.
? To attain efficiency, an automatic analysis of
the schema is performed in order to create in-
dexes allowing fast access to items. As each
different parsing schema needs to perform dif-
ferent searches for antecedent items, the index
structures we generate are schema-specific. In
this way, we guarantee constant-time access to
items so that the computational complexity of
our generated implementations is never above
the theoretical complexity of the parsers.
? Since parsing schemata have an open notation,
for any mathematical object can potentially
appear inside items, the system includes an ex-
tensibility mechanism which can be used to
define new kinds of objects to use in schemata.

2 Generating parsers for the XTAG
grammar
By using parsing schemata as the ones in (Alonso
et al, 1999; Nederhof, 1999) as input to our sys-
tem, we can easily obtain efficient implementa-
tions of several TAG parsing algorithms. In this
section, we describe how we have dealt with the
particular characteristics of the XTAG grammar
in order to make it compatible with our generic
compilation technique; and we also provide em-
pirical results which allow us to compare the per-
formance of several different TAG parsing algo-
rithms in the practical case of the XTAG gram-
mar. It shall be noted that similar comparisons
have been made with smaller grammars, such as
simplified subsets of the XTAG grammar, but not
with the whole XTAG grammar with all its trees
and feature structures. Therefore, our compari-
son provides valuable information about the be-
havior of various parsers on a complete, large-
scale natural language grammar. This behavior
is very different from the one that can be ob-
served on small grammars, since grammar size be-
comes a dominant factor in computational com-
plexity when large grammars like the XTAG are
used to parse relatively small natural language sen-
tences (Go?mez-Rodr??guez et al, 2006b).
2.1 Grammar conversion
The first step we undertook in order to generate
parsers for the XTAG grammar was a full conver-
sion of the grammar to an XML-based format, a
variant of the TAG markup language (TAGML).
In this way we had the grammar in a well-defined
format, easy to parse and modify. During this con-
version, the trees? anchor nodes were duplicated in
order to make our generic TAG parsers allow ad-
junctions on anchor nodes, which is allowed in the
XTAG grammar.
2.2 Feature structure unification
Two strategies may be used in order to take uni-
fication into account in parsing: feature structures
can be unified after parsing or during parsing. We
have compared the two approaches for the XTAG
grammar (see table 1), and the general conclusion
is that unification during parsing performs better
for most of the sentences, although its runtimes
have a larger variance and it performs much worse
for some particular cases.
In order to implement unification during parsing
in our parsing schemata based system, we must ex-
tend our schemata in order to perform unification.
This can be done in the following way:
? Items are extended so that they will hold a fea-
ture structure in addition to the rest of the infor-
mation they include.
? We need to define two operations on feature
structures: the unification operation and the
?keep variables? operation. The ?keep vari-
ables? operation is a transformation on feature
structures that takes a feature structure as an
argument, which may contain features, values,
symbolic variables and associations between
them, and returns a feature structure contain-
ing only the variable-value associations related
to a given elementary tree, ignoring the vari-
ables and values not associated through these
relations, and completely ignoring features.
? During the process of parsing, feature structures
that refer to the same node, or to nodes that are
taking part in a substitution or adjunction and

are going to collapse to a single node in the final
parse tree, must be unified. For this to be done,
the test that these nodes must unify is added as
a side condition to the steps that must handle
them, and the unification results are included
in the item generated by the consequent. Of
course, considerations about the different role
of the top and bottom feature structures in ad-
junction and substitution must be taken into ac-
count when determining which feature struc-
tures must be unified.
? Feature structures in items must only hold
variable-value associations for the symbolic
variables appearing in the tree to which the
structures refer, for these relationships hold the
information that we need in order to propa-
gate values according to the rules specified in
the unification equations. Variable-value asso-
ciations referring to different elementary trees
are irrelevant when parsing a given tree, and
feature-value and feature-variable associations
are local to a node and can?t be extrapolated to
other nodes, so we won?t propagate any of this
information in items. However, it must be used
locally for unification. Therefore, steps perform
unification by using the information in their an-
tecedent items and recovering complete feature
structures associated to nodes directly from the
grammar, and then use the ?keep-variables? op-
eration to remove the information that we don?t
need in the consequent item.
? In some algorithms, such as CYK, a single de-
ductive step deals with several different elemen-
tary tree nodes that don?t collapse into one in the
final parse tree. In this case, several ?keep vari-
ables? operations must be performed on each
step execution, one for each of these nodes. If
we just unified the information on all the nodes
and called ?keep variables? at the end, we could
propagate information incorrectly.
? In Earley-type algorithms, we must take a de-
cision about how predictor steps handle fea-
ture structures. Two options are possible: one
is propagating the feature structure in the an-
tecedent item to the consequent, and the other is
discarding the feature structure and generating
a consequent whose associated feature structure
is empty. The first option has the advantage that
violations of unification constraints are detected
earlier, thus avoiding the generation of some
items. However, in scenarios where a predic-
tor is applied to several items differing only in
their associated feature structures, this approach
generates several different items while the dis-
carding approach collapses them into a single
consequent item. Moreover, the propagating
approach favors the appearance of items with
more complex feature structures, thus making
unification operations slower. In practice, for
XTAG we have found that these drawbacks of
propagating the structures overcome the advan-
tages, especially in complex sentences, where
the discarding approach performs much better.
2.3 Tree filtering
The full XTAG English grammar contains thou-
sands of elementary trees, so performance is not
good if we use the whole grammar to parse each
sentence. Tree selection filters (Schabes and Joshi,
1991) are used to select a subset of the grammar,
discarding the trees which are known not to be
useful given the words in the input sentence.
To emulate this functionality in our parsing
schema-based system, we have used its exten-
sibility mechanism to define a function Selects-
tree(a,T) that returns true if the terminal symbol a
selects the tree T. The implementation of this func-
tion is a Java method that looks for this informa-
tion in XTAG?s syntactic database. Then the func-
tion is inserted in a filtering step on our schemata:
106
[a, i, j]
[Selected, ?] alpha ? Trees/SELECTS-TREE(A;?)
The presence of an item of the form
[Selected, ?] indicates that the tree ? has
been selected by the filter and can be used for
parsing. In order for the filter to take effect, we
add [Selected, ?] as an antecedent to every step
in our schemata introducing a new tree ? into the
parse (such as initters, substitution and adjoining
steps). In this way we guarantee that no trees that
don?t pass the filter will be used for parsing.
3 Comparing several parsers for the
XTAG grammar
In this section, we make a comparison of several
different TAG parsing algorithms ? the CYK-
based algorithm described at (Vijay-Shanker
and Joshi, 1985), Earley-based algorithms with
(Alonso et al, 1999) and without (Schabes, 1994)
the valid prefix property (VPP), and Nederhof?s
algorithm (Nederhof, 1999) ? on the XTAG En-
glish grammar (release 2.24.2001), by using our
system and the ideas we have explained. The
schemata for these algorithms without unification
support can be found at (Alonso et al, 1999).
These schemata were extended as described in the
previous sections, and used as input to our sys-
tem which generated their corresponding parsers.
These parsers were then run on the test sentences
shown in table 2, obtaining the performance mea-
sures (in terms of runtime and amount of items
generated) that can be seen in table 3. Note that
the sentences are ordered by minimal runtime.
As we can see, the execution times are not as
good as the ones we would obtain if we used
Sarkar?s XTAG distribution parser written in C
(Sarkar, 2000). This is not surprising, since our
parsers have been generated by a generic tool
without knowledge of the grammar, while the
XTAG parser has been designed specifically for
optimal performance in this grammar and uses ad-
ditional information (such as tree usage frequency
data from several corpora, see (XTAG, 2001)).
However, our comparison allows us to draw
conclusions about which parsing algorithms are
better suited for the XTAG grammar. In terms
of memory usage, CYK is the clear winner, since
it clearly generates less items than the other al-
gorithms, and a CYK item doesn?t take up more
memory than an Earley item.
On the other hand, if we compare execution
times, there is not a single best algorithm, since the
performance results depend on the size and com-
plexity of the sentences. The Earley-based algo-
rithm with the VPP is the fastest for the first, ?eas-
ier? sentences, but CYK gives the best results for
the more complex sentences. In the middle of the
two, there are some sentences where the best per-
formance is achieved by the variant of Earley that
doesn?t verify the valid prefix property. Therefore,
in practical cases, we should take into account the
most likely kind of sentences that will be passed
to the parser in order to select the best algorithm.
Nederhof?s algorithm is always the one with the
slowest execution time, in spite of being an im-
provement of the VPP Earley parser that reduces
worst-case time complexity. This is probably be-
cause, when extending the Nederhof schema in
order to support feature structure unification, we
get a schema that needs more unification opera-
tions than Earley?s and has to use items that store
several feature structures. Nederhof?s algorithm
would probably perform better in relation to the
others if we had used the strategy of parsing with-
out feature structures and then performing unifica-
tion on the output parse forest.
4 Conclusions
A generic system that generates parsers from al-
gebraic specifications (parsing schemata) has been
applied to the particular case of the XTAG gram-
mar. In order to be able to generate XTAG parsers,
some transformations were made to the grammar,
and TAG parsing schemata were extended with
feature structure unification support and a simple
tree filtering mechanism.
The generated implementations allow us to
compare the performance of different TAG parsers
when working with a large-scale grammar, the
XTAG English grammar. In this paper, we have
shown the results for four algorithms: a CYK-
based algorithm, Earley-based algorithms with
and without the VPP, and Nederhof?s algorithm.
The result shows that the CYK-based parser is the
least memory-consuming algorithm. By measur-
ing execution time, we find that CYK is the fastest
algorithm for the most complex sentences, but the
Earley-based algorithm with the VPP is the fastest
for simpler cases. Therefore, when choosing a
parser for a practical application, we should take
