Abstract
This paper describes the open-source
Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Transla-
tion Decoder - Phramer. The paper also
presents the UTD (HLTRI) system build
for the WMT06 shared task. Our goal was
to improve the translation quality by en-
hancing the translation table and by pre-
processing the source language text
1 Introduction
Despite the fact that the research in Statistical
Machine Translation (SMT) is very active, there
isn?t an abundance of open-source tools available
to the community. In this paper, we present
Phramer, an open-source system that embeds a
phrase-based decoder, a minimum error rate train-
ing (Och, 2003) module and various tools related
to Machine Translation (MT). The software is re-
leased under BSD license and it is available at
http://www.phramer.org/.
We also describe our Phramer-based system
that we build for the WMT06 shared task.
2 Phramer
Phramer is a phrase-based SMT system written in
Java. It includes:
? A decoder that is compatible with Pharaoh
(Koehn, 2004),
? A minimum error rate training (MERT) mod-
ule, compatible with Phramer?s decoder, with
Pharaoh and easily adaptable to other SMT
or non-SMT tasks and
? various tools.
The decoder is fully compatible with Pharaoh
1.2 in the algorithms that are implemented, input
files (configuration file, translation table, language
models) and command line. Some of the advantages
of Phramer over Pharaoh are: (1) source code
availability and its permissive license; (2) it is very
fast (1.5?3 times faster for most of the configura-
tions); (3) it can work with various storage layers for
the translation table (TT) and the language models
(LMs): memory, remote (access through TCP/IP),
disk (using SQLite databases1). Extensions for other
storage layers can be very easily implemented; (4) it
is more configurable; (5) it accepts compressed data
files (TTs and LMs); (6) it is very easy to extend; an
example is provided in the package ? part-of-speech
decoding on either source language, target language
or both; support for POS-based language models;
(7) it can internally generate n-best lists. Thus no
external tools are required.
The MERT module is a highly modular, efficient
and customizable implementation of the algorithm
described in (Och, 2003). The release has imple-
mentations for BLEU (Papineni et al, 2002), WER
and PER error criteria and it has decoding interfaces
for Phramer and Pharaoh. It can be used to
search parameters over more than one million vari-
ables. It offers features as resume search, reuse hy-
potheses from previous runs and various strategies
to search for optimal ? weight vectors.

The package contains a set of tools that include:
? Distributed decoding (compatible with both
Phramer and Pharaoh) ? it automatically
splits decoding jobs and distributes them to
workers and assembles the results. It is compat-
ible with lattice generation, therefore it can also
be used during weights search (using MERT).
? Tools to process translation tables ? filter the
TT based on the input file, flip TT to reuse it
for English-to-Foreign translation, filter the TT
by phrase length, convert the TT to a database.
3 WMT06 Shared Task
We have assembled a system for participation in the
WMT 2006 shared task based on Phramer and
other tools. We participated in 5 subtasks: DE?EN,
FR?EN, ES?EN, EN?FR and EN?ES.
3.1 Baseline system
3.1.1 Translation table generation
To generate a translation table for each pair of lan-
guages starting from a sentence-aligned parallel cor-
pus, we used a modified version of the Pharaoh
training software 2. The software also required
GIZA++ word alignment tool(Och and Ney, 2003).
We generated for each phrase pair in the trans-
lation table 5 features: phrase translation probabil-
ity (both directions), lexical weighting (Koehn et al,
2003) (both directions) and phrase penalty (constant
value).
3.1.2 Decoder
The Phramer decoder was used to translate the
devtest2006 and test2006 files. We accelerated the
decoding process by using the distributed decoding
tool.
3.1.3 Minimum Error Rate Training
We determined the weights to combine the mod-
els using the MERT component in Phramer. Be-
cause of the time constrains for the shared task sub-
mission3, we used Pharaoh + Carmel4 as the de-
2http://www.iccs.inf.ed.ac.uk/?pkoehn/training.tgz
3After the shared task submission, we optimized a lot our
decoder. Before the optimizations (LM optimizations, fixing
bugs that affected performance), Phramer was 5 to 15 times
slower than Pharaoh.

coder for the MERT algorithm.
3.1.4 Preprocessing
We removed from the source text the words that
don?t appear either in the source side of the train-
ing corpus (thus we know that the translation table
will not be able to translate them) or in the lan-
guage model for the target language (and we esti-
mate that there is a low chance that the untranslated
word might actually be part of the reference transla-
tion). The purpose of this procedure is to minimize
the risk of inserting words into the automatic trans-
lation that are not in the reference translation.
We applied this preprocessing step only when the
target language was English.
3.2 Enhancements to the baseline systems
Our goal was to improve the translation quality by
enhancing the the translation table.
The following enhancements were implemented:
? reduce the vocabulary size perceived by the
GIZA++ and preset algnment for certain
words
? ?normalize? distortion between pairs of lan-
guages by reordering noun-adjective construc-
tions
The first enhancement identifies pairs of tokens in
the parallel sentences that, with a very high proba-
bility, align together and they don?t align with other
tokens in the sentence. These tokens are replaced
with a special identifier, chosen so that GIZA++ will
learn the alignment between them easier than before
replacement. The targeted token types are proper
nouns (detected when the same upper-cased token
were present in both the foreign sentence and the
English sentence) and numbers, also taking into ac-
count the differences between number representa-
tion in different languages (i.e.: 399.99 vs. 399,99).
Each distinct proper noun to be replaced in the sen-
tence was replaced with a specific identifier, distinct
from other replacement identifiers already used in
the sentence. The same procedure was applied also
for numbers. The specific identifiers were reused in
other sentences. This has the effect of reducing the
vocabulary, thus it provides a large number of in-
stances for the special token forms. The change in

Table 1: Vocabulary size change due to forced align-
ment
the vocabulary size is shown in Table 1. To simplify
the process, we limited the replacement of tokens
to one-to-one (one real token to one special token),
so that the word alignment file can be directly used
together with the original parallel corpus to extract
phrases required for the generation of the translation
table. Table 2 shows an example of the output.
The second enhancement tries to improve the
quality of the translation by rearranging the words in
the source sentence to better match the correct word
order in the target language (Collins et al, 2005).
We focused on a very specific pattern ? based on the
part-of-speech tags, changing the order of NN-ADJ
phrases in the non-English sentences. This process
was also applied to the input dev/test files, when the
target language was English. Figure 1 shows the re-
ordering process and its effect on the alignment.
The expected benefits are:
? Better word alignment due to an alignment
closer to the expected alignment (monotone).
? More phrases extracted from the word aligned
corpus. Monotone alignment tends to generate
more phrases than a random alignment.
? Higher mixture weight for the monotone dis-
tortion model because of fewer reordering con-
straints during MERT, thus the value of the
monotone distortion model increases, ?tighten-
ing? the translation.
3.3 Experimental Setup
We implemented the first enhancement on ES?EN
subtask by part-of-speech tagging the Spanish text
using TreeTagger5 followed by a NN-ADJ inver-
sion heuristic.
The language models provided for the task was
used.
We used the 1,000 out of the 2,000 sentences
in each of the dev2006 datasets to determine
weights for the 8 models used during decoding (one
monotone distortion mode, one language model,
five translation models, one sentence length model)
through MERT. The weights were determined in-
dividually for each pair of source-target languages.

Table 4: Results on the test2006 files
Using these weights, we measured the BLEU score
on the devtest2006 datasets. Based on the model
chosen, we decoded the test2006 datasets using the
same weights as for devtest2006.
3.4 Results
Table 3 presents the results on the devtest2006 files
using different settings. Bold values represent the
result for the settings that were also chosen for the
final test. Table 4 shows the results on the submitted
files (test2006).
3.5 Conclusions
The enhancements that we proposed provide small
improvements on the devtest2006 files. As expected,
when we used the NN-ADJ inversion the ratio ?D?LM
increased from 0.545 to 0.675. The LM is the only
model that opposes the tendency of the distortion
model towards monotone phrase order.
Phramer delivers a very good baseline system.
Using only the baseline system, we obtain +0.68 on
DE?EN, +0.43 on FR?EN and -0.18 on ES?EN
difference in BLEU score compared to WPT05?s
best system (Koehn and Monz, 2005). This fact is
caused by the MERT module. This module is capa-
ble of estimating parameters over a large develop-
ment corpus in a reasonable time, thus it is able to
generate highly relevant parameters.
