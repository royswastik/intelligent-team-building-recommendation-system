Abstract 
This paper presents an empirical analysis 
of prosodic phenomena (intonation and 
timing) in 'common ground units' 
(Nakatani & Traurn 1999). The analysis 
is used to address questions of the role of 
prosody in dialogue while taking into 
account he complexities of multispeaker 
discourse. We address some 
methodological concerns of how best to 
carry out a study of this kind as well as 
our theoretical questions about he formal 
identification of dialogue structures at 
levels higher than the micro-level of 
'dialogue act', or 'move'. 
Introduction 
This paper eports ome of the results from our 
research into the relationship between prosodic 
structure and discourse structure in dialogue. 
One of our particular interests i how to identify 
and analyse relevant prosodic parameters in 
multi-speaker discourse. We have been 
examining the kinds of dialogue structure 
frameworks that best account for patterns of 
prosodic phenomena; nd conversely, the types 
of dialogue structure that exhibit prosodic 
regularities. Our research domain is hurnam 
human atural dialogue Settings but our questions 
are equally relevant o researchers working on 
systems for more naturalistic human-computer 
interfaces, as well as those developing better 
automated systems for annotating large speech 
corpora. 
The main methodological considerations 
associated with our current work are: 
a) how natural dialogues can be reliably 
annotated to allow independent comparisons 
and correlations of prosodic and structural 
features, 
b) the identification and classification of units 
of dialogue that reflect the 'joint action' 
feature of interactive discourse (ie. that both 
participants in a dialogue contribute to 
dialogue structure (Clark 1992, 1996), an 
aspect of dialogue that fundamentally 
differentiates it from monologic discourse). 
These issues will be addressed in this paper 
using data from a corpus of naturally produced 
spoken dialogue taken from the Australian Map 
Task corpus (Millar et al1994). Here we have 
focussed on the process of grounding, the 
assignment of utterances to 'common ground 
units' (CGUs - Nakatani & Traurn 1999) and the 
internal structure of these units, as a means of 
illustrating some of the problems that both 
methodological issues raise. We show how 
some of these problems might be overcome by 
focussing on sequences of initiating and 
responding (typically grounding) contributions 
within CGUs, as a site for prosodic analysis, 
rather than on the boundaries of the units as a 
whole (cf. Stiding et al2000a). This approach 
thus preserves the notion that one can identify 
'chunks' of dialogue in which particular types of 
information are acknowledged as being in the 
common ground of both participants, while 
remaining true to the dynamic nature of the 
grounding negotiation. 
1. Background 
1.1. Prosody and Discourse Structure 
Most. empirical work examining prosody in 
discourse has focussed on its function in 
monologue (eg. Swerts 1997, Nakatani et al
1995, Hirchberg & Nakatani 1996). These 
studies have found that a range of acoustic 
parameters associated with prosody, such as 
final lengthening and type of boundary tone, are 
good indicators of the boundaries between 
different discourse units at micro and macro 
levels of discourse structure. 
More recently, there has been an interest in 
examining how prosody may be used in dialogue 
to signal discourse structure in that domain. 
Shriberg et al(1998) showed that various 
prosodic cues (duration, F0, pause length and 
speaking rate) were relevant for the automatic 
classification of dialogue 'acts'. Stifling et al
(2000b) similarly showed strong 
correspondences between the boundaries of 
dialogue acts and prosodic phenomena such as 
pitch reset and intonational phrase boundaries 
(represented as ToBI 'break indices'). But 
dialogue acts are the 'parts' of dialogue most 
akin with structural elements of monologic 
discourse, since each 'act' can be analysed as 
independent utterances by a single speaker. 
Higher levels of dialogue structure necessarily 
involve some interactive 'chunk' of the discourse 
to which both participants in the dialogue 
contribute some speech. 
So while it is clear that prosody serves to delimit 
dialogue acts, and to some extent distinguish 
between them (eg. Shriberg et al1998, Koiso et 
al 1998, Stifling et al2000b), the question 
remains whether prosody is also a reliable 
indicator of dialogue structure at higher levels 
(analogous with the higher levels of monologic 
discourse structure described in Swerts (1997), 
Nakatani et al (1995), and others) and to what 
uses are prosodic phenomena put in the context 
of higher levels of dialogue structure. 
1.2 Grounding and Common Ground Units 
Grounding is the process by which information 
contributed by participants in interaction istaken 
to have entered the 'common ground', or mutual 
knowledge of the participants (Clark & Schaefer 
1989, Clark 1996, Traum 1994). The process of 
grounding requires that one participant 
contributes something to the discourse 
(minimally, a dialogue act), and that the other 
participant make some indication that the 
contribution has been heard and accepted as a 
contribution (though not necessarily understood). 
This 'indication' may be a verbal 
acknowledgment (or some other kind of verbal 
response) or it may be some kind of non-verbal 
comrnlmicative act (like head nods, facial 
expression and other gestures). 
Traum (1998) and Nakatani & Traum (1999) 
have recently proposed taking grounding as the 
basic principle behind the structuring of dialogue 
at levels ligher than the dialogue act. Minimal 
units of acknowledged common ground have 
been considered as the building blocks of higher 
level dialogue structures based on intentional or 
informational content (eg. 'Common Ground 
Units', or 'CGUs' Nakatani & Traum (1999)). 
CGUs, which represent grounding at the 
'illocutionary level' (Clark 1996), have been 
proposed as a meso-level dialogue structure -
roughly the same level that dialogue games 
(Carletta et al 1997) or adjacency pairs (eg. 
37 
Sinclair & Coulthard 1975) occupy in their 
dialogue structure frameworks. 
The appeal of taking units basexl on grounding as 
the level of dialogue structure above the 
microlevel of 'act' (as argued in Nakatani & 
Traurn 1999) lies in its pfiofitization of mutual 
understanding as a central component of 
dialogue, regardless of the type of initiation and 
response. In the 'CGU' fiamework, some 
responses themselves get grounded so that the 
result is a complex configuration of overlapping 
and embedded units of information entered into 
the common ground of the participants. This 
approach thus acknowledges importance of the 
conlributions by both participants in the 
grounding process. It highlights the 'joint action' 
aspect of dialogic ommunication. 
Evaluation of the coding of CGUs in dialogue by 
the Discourse Resource Initiative (Core et al
1999) showed a low degree of intercoder 
reliability, especially for those coding the HCRC 
Map Task corpus (Anderson et al1991). Some 
of the inconsistencies across coders were 
attributed to "iraonation and ~rfing" (p. 61), as 
well as to difficulties in coding different types of 
acknowledgments. Some proposals for the 
classification of acknowledgments were made 
(Core et al1999) and Stirling et al(2000a) have 
noted some parameters along Which CGUs might 
be further classified. 
The ways that his classification has been refined 
and utilised for the cun, ent paper are described in
section 2 (methods), where we also describe our 
system of annotation for both prosodic and CGU 
properties of the dialogues, and explain our 
method for utilising this annotation for the current 
analysis. In section 3 we present some results of 
our investigation fprosody and grounding in the 
light of the methodological issues listed above. 
These results will be used in section 4 to address 
the following theoretical questions, as well as to 
set the agenda for future research into prosodic 
correlates of dialogue structure: 
a) can prosody be used as a heuristic for 
identifying dialogue structure above the level 
of the 'dialogue act'? 
b) does the process of 'grounding' have any 
formal basis, prosodic or otherwise, 
independent of the identification of dialogue 
acts? 
2. Methods 
2.1 Annotation Methods 
Our corpus consists of 4 dialogues from the 
MAP TASK section of the Australian National 
Database of Spoken Language - ANDOSL 
(Millar et al 1994). This corpus is closely 
modelled on the HCRC Map Task (Anderson et 
al 1991). Participants worked in pairs, each with 
a map in front of them that the other could not 
see. One participant ( he 'instruction-giver' IG)
had a route marked on their map and was 
required by the task to instruct he other (the 
'instruction-follower' IF) in drawing the correct 
route onto their own map. The maps were 
similar, but differed in the presence, position and 
names of certain of the landmarks. Each pair of 
participants participated in two dialogues, 
swapping roles of instruction-giver and 
instruction-follower, and thus producing a first 
time and second time attempt at the task. 
The four dialogues used here were from two 
pairs of participants: the two dialogues from a 
pair 'Known' to one another, differing in which 
participant took the role of instruction-giver, and 
the two dialogues from a pair 'Unknown' to one 
another, also differing in which participant took 
the role of instruction-giver. In each case, the 
pairs Were mixed-gender. The dialogues were 
chosen randomly and the speakers belonged to 
the General Australian English dialectal grouping. 
The pre-recorded dialogues were copied from 
CD and digitised for analysis at 22 kHz using 
Entropic's ESPS/ Waves + speech analysis 
software running on a Sun workstation in the 
Phonetics Laboratory of the UniversiW of 
Melbourne. A complete orthographic 
transcription fthe dialogues was carried out. 
. . . . _ -  - 
38 
The prosodic featu_es of the dialogues were 
labelled on separate tiers using the ToBI (Tone 
and Break Indices) prosodic transcription 
conventions for Australian English, detailed in 
Fletcher & Harrington (1996), closely modelled 
on the criteria developed for American English 
intonation (Beckman & Ayers Elam 1994/1997). 
The dialogues were prosodically annotated for 
break indices (degree of juncture) and phrase 
and boundary tones according to ToBI 
conventions using the Xwaves label function. 
The dialogues were also aunota~ed on separate 
tiers in Xwaves for the timing features of pause 
location and duration (in ms), and overlap 
location and duration (in ms) i. These features 
were noted with respect to preceding and 
following talk. 
The features of break index, phrase and 
boundary tones and pause and overlap 
phenomena were selected to address the 
'intonation and timing' problems that were raised 
by the Discourse Resource Initiative (Core et al
1999), and because related work in conversation 
analysis has demonstrated the importance of 
intonation (especially final contours) to being 
able to account for the meaning of 
acknowledgments in interaction (eg. Mffller 
1996, Gardner 1998). 
Break Indices (BI) were labelled as follows: 4 
(full intonation phrase boundary); 3 (intermediate 
intonation phrase boundary); 3p (disfluent 
intermediate intonation phrase boundary). 
Boundary tones were labelled as follows: H-H% 
for a high rising tone (131 4); L-L% for a falling 
or low tone (BI 4); I.-H% for a low rising tone 
(BI 4); H-L% for a mid-level tone (131 4); H- for 
a high intermediate phrase boundary (BI 3), I.- 
for a low intermediate phrase boundary (BI 3). 
The pause and overlap labelling allowed us to 
extract information about the timing of each 
speaker contribution with respect to the previous 
and following contributions to the talk. With 
respect to the preceding talk, contributions were 
analysed as having a pause before (pb), partially 
overlapping with the preceding conlribution (olb), 
completely overlapping (ol), no pause or overlap 
with the preceding unit (or 'latch' - lb), or 
'continued" (if the previous contribution was by 
the same speaker without an interceding pause 
(c)). With respect to the following talk, 
contributions were analysed as having a pause 
after (pa), partially overlapping with the following 
contribution (ola), completely overlapping (ol), no 
pause or overlap with following contribution (or 
latch - la), or 'continued' (if the next contribution 
was by the same speaker without an interceding 
pause (c)). Table 1 provides a summary of the 
labels used for prosodic and timing phenomena.

Since the major goal of our research was to 
investigate associations between prosodic 
phenomena nd discourse structure, we coded 
discourse categories independently from dividing 
the speech signal into prosodic units and the 
coding of prosodic phenomena (these parameters 
were coded by different researchers). 
The dialogues were annotated for Common 
Ground Units, following Nakatani & Tram 
(1999). ii The coding was carried out by two 
researchers independently who then collaborated 
on a consensual version for each dialogue. The 
codes were entered on separate tiers in ESPS/ 
Waves +, separated according to which speaker 
gave which contribution. This meant that 
initiations and endpoints of CGUs were 
numbered and aligned with the speaker who 
began and ended each unit. Within each CGU 
we also coded the first 'response' by the other 
participant, which typically established either that 
the initial information was entered into the 
common ground, or that further negotiation was 
required in order to ground the information. In 
39 
this paper, we only considered CGUs that 
contained fully grounded infi3rrnafion at their 
close (ie. we did not include abandoned or 
discontinuous CGUs - see Nakatani & Traum 
1999). In Stifling et al(2000a) we reported on 
some of the prosodic characteristics of the final 
unit in CGUs (break indices and turn boundaries 
only). Here we report on the prosodic 
characteristics of the initiation move of the CGU 
and the prosodic profile of this first responding 
contribution. 
2.2. Classification of CGUs 
We go a step further than Nakatanl & Traum 
(1999) and Stirling et al(2000a) in further 
classifying CGUs in terms of the internal 
characteristics of the grounding process - 
whether they consisted of a 'simple' exchange 
of initiating move and responding move, or 
whether their structure involved more 
contributions (by either speaker) before the CGU 
in question was considered to be complete (ie. 
the information was acknowledged as entered 
into the common ground). The former type we 
called 'Simple' CGUs, while the latter type we 
called 'Complex' CGUs. Complex CGUs were 
further classified into four types based on 
pragmatic and sequential criteria, as follows: 
a) Overlapping CGUs, where the grounding 
element of one unit was itself grounded with 
some verbal acknowledgment in the next 
CGU, as in (1) below. 
b) CGUs which consisted of further 
acknowledgment(s) by the other speaker 
subsequent to the first grounding element, as 
in (2) below. 
c) CGUs which contained more than one 
acknowledgment by the same speaker (as in 
(3) below) 
d) CGUs which negotiated information at 
different levels of communication lower than 
the 'illocutionary' level (eg. the level of 
'presentation' or 'locution' (Clark 1996)), 
and were therefore considered part of a 
larger CGU which was gounded at the level 
ofillocution, as in (4) below.

All four types of complex CGUs represent some 
kind of 'expansion' of the canonical CGU 
exchange. In overlapping CGUs, the second 
'response" functions to ground the first response. 
In multiple acknowledgment CGUs, the second 
response is not analysed as 'grounding', but is 
nevertheless some kind of filrther 
acknowledgment (either by the same speaker or 
by the other speaker). In the final case of 
complex CGUs, the first response is a signal that 
perhaps ome part of the initial contribution had 
not entered into the eomrnon gound and that 
further collaboration was required. '~ 
These categories are not claimed to represent 
the only way that CGUs can be classified (el. 
Core et al1999). Nevertheless they provide us 
with a useful basis for addressing differences in 
the role of prosody in CGUs. 
40 
Altogether there were 419 CGUs in the corpus. 
Of these, 241 were 'simple' CGUs and 178 
were 'complex'. Of the 178 complex CGUs, 47 
(26%) were 'overlapping', 59 (33%) contained 
multiple acknowledgment by both participants, 52 
(29%) contained multiple acknowledgements by 
the same speaker, and 20 (1 I%) contained more 
complex negotiations of understanding until 
acknowledgment of mutual understanding of the 
initial dialogue act was reached (the level at 
which CGUs were delineated). 
We hypothesised that since, on our definition, 
complex CGUs differed from the simple type in 
terms of the structure of their response 'phase', 
rather than in terms of their initiation phase, there 
should be no difference between simple and 
complex CGUs with respect o the timing and 
prosodic profile of initiations. However, we 
predicted that there might be quantitatively 
recognisable properties of the first response in 
complex CGUs which motivated their expansion, 
and that these would be different from those 
found in simple CGUs. While we expected that 
these 'recognisable' properties would involve a 
combination of grammatical, pragmatic and 
prosodic properties, here we were only 
interested in the extent to which simple and 
complex CGUs could be differentiated on 
prosodic grounds. 
In order to check these hypotheses, we pooled 
the four dialogues and compared initiation and 
first response contributions in simple and 
complex CGUs for each of the four parameters 
identified above (BI, boundary tone, timing 
(before) and timing (after)). Chi square tests 
were carried out on each of these comparisons 
to determine which sets of parameters displayed 
significant variation between simple CGUs and 
complex CGUs. The results are presented in the 
following section. 
3. Results 
Chi square tests on the combined totals of all 
CGUs showed highly significant differences 
(p<0.001) between initiations and responses for 
all four prosodic and timing parameters. This 
result is consistent with those reported in Stirling 
et al(2000b), where it was shown that initiation 
type dialogue acts could be prosodically 
differentiated from response type dialogue acts. 
Here we were more interested inthe question of 
whether the complexity of the CGU was also 
reflected in initiation and response contributions. 
The results reported in the following subsections 
therefore refer to the percentage number of 
each prosodic and timing parameter as a 
proportion of the CGU type (percentages are in 
boldface) - the total number of simple CGUs or 
the total number of complex CGUs - for 
initiations and responses independently.

As expected, there was no significant difference 
between simple and complex CGUs with respect 
to their initiation contribution break indices. 
Examination of the first res~nse of these units 
did show a significant difference between simple 
41 
and complex CGUs with respect to break 
indices. In particular, the first responses for 
simple CGUs had a high proportion of BI3 
(corresponding with an intermediate phrase 
boundary) compared with complex CGUs and a 
relatively low proportion of BI4 (corresponding 
with a full intonation phrase). That is, the first 
response contribution of a complex CGU was 
more likely to end with a full inttonafional phrase 
boundary (BI4) than the first response 
contribution of a simple CGU.

In contrast with the results for BI reported 
above, there were significant differences found 
between simple and complex CGUs for 
boundary tones in both initiation and response 
contributions. With respect to initiating 
contributions, a higher proportion of low falling 
(L-L%) boundary tones (42.1% vs. 29.5%) and 
a lower proportion of low rising (L-H%) 
boundary tones (18.5% vs. 29.9%) were found 
in the complex CGUs, compared with simple 
CGUs. Proportions of high rising (H-H%) 
boundary tones were not significantly different 
and there were proportionally few instances of 
other types of contours. 
Like initiation conlributions, the results for 
response contributions also show a higher 
proportion of low falling tones in complex CGUs 
than in simple CGUs (30.3% cf. 17.5%). The 
proportions of both high rising and low rising 
tones appears table across the types of CGUs 
however. 
The numbers of response contn'butions which 
had other types of boundary tones (including no 
boundary tone) were much higher than those 
found for initiating units. This was expected, 
since responses to initiation units were typically 
acknowledgments of grounding (like 'okay' or 
'yeh'), which were then followed by other talk 
by the same speaker continuing an intonational 
phrase. The higher proportion of such 'non- 
final' contours (H-L%, L-, H- and none) for 
simple CGUs than complex CGUs reflects a set 
of instances in which the respondent answers a
yes-no question, and then makes a further 
response in the same intonational phrase that 
is new information which was itself grounded 
(and was therefore coded as a new CGU). 
These non-final contours typically also 
corresponded with break indices of less than 4, 
accounting for the relatively high proportion of 
BI3s in responses in complex CGUs (noted in 
the previous ection).

Like the results for break indices, the results for 
the timing of units with respect o immediately 
prior talk showed no significant differences 
between simple and complex CGUs for initiation 
contributions, but did show significant differences 
with respect o first responses. In particular, 
there was a relatively high proportion of 
responses in complex CGUs whose onset 
occurred while the other speaker was still 
talking, resulting in an overlap (18.5% vs. 7.5%). 
When the first response in a CGU is at least 
partially overlapping with the initiation 
contribution, it creates an environment in which 
both participants must work harder (ie. make 
more contributions) in order for the 
acknowledgment of common groundedriess to be 
clear. At least some of these overlaps resulted 
in the same speaker repeating an 
acknowledgment of grounding with no overlap, 
as in example (3) above. However, they also 
resulted in complex CGUs of the other kinds.

The results for the timing of the unit following 
the target contribution also showed no significant 
difference for initiations between simple and 
complex CGUs, while the responses did show a 
difference of distribution. However, the 
asymmetry in overlapping found in the preceding 
set of the results did not occur when one 
considered the contribution foUowing the first 
response. In this case, the category which 
showed the greatest degree of difference 
between simple and complex CGUs was the 
category of 'latch' (22.5% vs. 12%), where the 
second speaker timed his/her next turn to follow 
from the target contribution without any pause or 
overlap. Responses in complex CGUs showed a 
higher proportion of latching with the following 
contribution. This high proportion of latching is 
perhaps an indication of a smooth transition from 
first response to timber grounding contributions 
within the CGU. 
4. D iscuss ion  
The results show that for three of the 
parameters investigated (break index, timing 
before and after the target contribution), there 
was little or no variation according to the type of 
CGU that the contribution initiated (simple or 
complex). This finding was consistent with our 
hypothesis that if there were any measurable 
differences between these CGU types, they 
would be found in the first response contn'bution 
of the CGU, and not in its initiation contn'bution. 
Also consistent with our hypothesis was the 
result that all four prosodic and .timing 
43 
parameters displayed differences between 
simple and complex CGUs in the first response 
contribution. Complex CGUs displayed more 
overlapped first responses, fi~wer incomplete 
intonation phrases (131 of less; than 4) and a 
higher proportion of low falling boundary tones 
than the response contributions of simple CGUs. 
Explanations for some of these results were 
provided in the previous section, but further 
analysis is required before we can really gain an 
accurate picture of the formal profile of complex 
CGUs (cf. simple CGUs). In particular, we 
require an analysis of the different types of 
complex CGUs to determine whether they 
display formal regularities. It 1nay be that only 
one or two types of complex CGUs are 
contributing to the patterns observed here. Such 
an analysis is planned in future work. We also 
plan to conduct a similar study that takes into 
account he dialogue act type of initiation and 
first responses to determine more extensively the 
full range of factors which influence intonation 
patterns and the timing of contributions in 
dialogue, iv 
Our results do confirm the necessity of 
developing strategies for the analysis of prosody 
in dialogue that take into account he effects of 
sequence. Not only did initiation contributions 
overall behave differently to response 
contributions with respect to prosody and timing 
(a result which we did not address in detail here), 
but the responses themselves could also be 
differentiated based on whether they 'finished' a 
CGU, or whether they were tbllowed by other 
contributions before grounding was achieved. 
Results such as these suggest hat with respect 
to the formal identification (c? pragmatic 
identification) of levels of dialogue structure 
higher than the dialogue act, structures defined in 
terms of sequential position, as such as 
adjacency pairs, might be more compatible with 
patterns we have observed in our data. The low 
level of intercoder reliability for CGUs, as 
reported in Core et al(1999) also suggests the 
lack of readily identifiable tbrrnal properties. 
Even taking 'intonation and timing' into account, 
as we have done here, does not clearly point to a 
formal profile of CGUs independent of 
sequences of dialogue acts. 
Empirical investigation\ of the role of prosody in 
multi-speaker discourse is still in its infancy, and 
we are still developing tools of analysis that free 
us from looking only at those aspects of dialogue 
that best mirror the structure of monologic 
discourse. We have found that our method of 
both prosodic and discourse segment annotation 
in ESPS/Waves+ has provided us with the power 
to develop this investigation further. In future 
work we will be able to easily incorporate 
additional variables, such as dialogue acts, 
complex CGU type, and a range of other 
prosodic phenomena into our analysis, while 
keeping track of the sequences in which these 
joint actions occur.

i Overlap location and duration could be measured 
accurately because the dialogues were recorded on 
dual channels. 
We also coded other features of dialogue structure 
such as dialogue acts. See Stirling et al(2000b) for 
more details of that annotation method. 
The categories of complex CGUs were not all 
mutually exclusive. For example, aCGU could contain 
multiple acknowledgments by both speakers. ~nce 
these overlaps occurred infrequently, for the 
purposes of  this paper we assigned each complex 
CGU to only one 'primary' classification. 
iv Such an analysis might for example, help provide an 
explanation for why, contra to our expectations, the 
initiation phases of complex CGUs showed 
differences in boundary tone phenomena from the 
initiation phases of simple CGUs.
