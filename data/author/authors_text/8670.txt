Abstract 
The Semantic Knowledge-base of Con-
temporary Chinese (SKCC) is a large 
scale Chinese semantic resource devel-
oped by the Institute of Computational 
Linguistics of Peking University. It pro-
vides a large amount of semantic informa-
tion such as semantic hierarchy and 
collocation features for 66,539 Chinese 
words and their English counterparts. Its 
POS and semantic classification represent 
the latest progress in Chinese linguistics 
and language engineering. The descrip-
tions of semantic attributes are fairly 
thorough, comprehensive and authorita-
tive. The paper introduces the outline of 
SKCC, and indicates that it is effective for 
word sense disambiguation in MT appli-
cations and is likely to be important for 
general Chinese language processing. 
Key words:  Semantic knowledge-base,

1 Introduction 
Semantic resources play an important role in many 
areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The 
Institute of Computational Linguistics (ICL) of 
Peking University has been engaged in research 
and development of the Semantic Knowledge-base 
of Contemporary Chinese (SKCC) in the last eight 
years. This lexicon-building project was a collabo-
ration with the Institute of Computing Technology, 
Chinese Academy of Sciences during 1994-1998, 
and resulted in a machine-readable bilingual lexi-
con suitable for use with Machine Translation ap-
plications, which contained a fairly complete 
characterization of the semantic classification, va-
lence specifications and collocation properties for 
49 thousands Chinese words and their English 
counterparts (Wang Hui, 1998).  
Since 2001, the further development of SKCC 
has been co-conducted by ICL and Chinese De-
partment of Peking University. At present, SKCC 
has made great progress. Not only is the scale ex-
tended to 66,539 entries, but also the quality has 
been immensely improved. The semantic classifi-
cation in the updated edition of SKCC is the em-
bodiment of the very latest progress in Chinese 
linguistics and language engineering, while the 
semantic descriptions are comprehensive and thor-
ough. It can provide rich lexical semantic informa-
tion for various NLP applications. 
2 Outline of SKCC 
2.1 Scale and Structure 
SKCC consists of one general database and six 
sub-databases. The general database contains 
shared attributes of all the 66,539 entries, while the 
sub-databases provide detailed descriptions of the 
distinctive semantic attributes associated with the 
parts of speech (POS). For example, the verb data-
base has 16 attribute fields, noun database and ad-
jective database has 15 attribute fields respectively. 
Database

nouns 38,478 15 5
verbs 21,142 16 3
adjective 5,577 15 8
pronouns 236 15 3
adverbs 997 11 1
numerals 109 11 1
General  66,539 8 5
Total 133,07 91 1
Table 1  Scale of SKCC 
All of the six sub-databases can be linked to 
the general database through four key fields, 
namely ENTRY, POS, HOMOMORPHISM and 
SENSE.  As a result, the son knots can inherit all 
information from their father knots (Figure 1).

2.2 Semantic Hierarchy 
One of the most outstanding characteristics of 
SKCC is that its semantic hierarchy is based on 
grammatical analysis, rather than merely on gen-
eral knowledge (as illustrated in Figure 2 below). 
This classification system represents the latest pro-
gress in Chinese semantics. It is very useful for 
NLP applications(Zhan Weidong, 1997), as well as 
compatible with various semantic resources, such 
as Wordnet (Christiane Fellbaum. 1998), Chinese 
concept dictionary (CCD)( Yu Jiangsheng, 2002), 
HowNet(Dong Zhendong, 2000) etc.  Currently, 
the classification of all of the 66,539 entries has 
already been completed.

2.3 Comprehensive Semantic Descriptions 
There is close correlation between lexical meaning 
and its distribution. Oriented to MT and IR, one 
aim of SKCC is to provide detailed semantic de-
scription and collocation behavior that in many 
cases is likely to be uniquely associated with a sin-
gle sense.  For example, following attribute fields 
have been filled with values in the verb database 
(see table 2). 
ENTRY Commonly used Chinese 
word or idiom phrase 
PRONUNCIATION Chinese Pinyin with tones 
such as ?chi3zi5? for ??
??(ruler) 
PART OF 
SPEECH 
POS tagging of per word or 
idiom 
SUB-
CATEGORY 
Sub-category tagging of per 
word or idiom 
POSs All POS tagging of per 
word 
HOMOMORPHISM Homograph number  
SENSE Sense number of per 
polysemous word  
DEFINITION Sense definition  
SEMANTIC 
CATEGORY 
Semantic categories of per 
word or idiom.  A word can 
be tagged with two or more 
semantic categories. For 
instance, the noun ???? 
(greengrocery) belong to 
?plant | food? categories. 
VALENCE Valence number of each 
entry. For example, ??
??(cough) is a one-valence 
verb?while ???(eat) is a 
two-valence one, 
???(give) is three-valence. 
AGENT Actor of action or motion.  
OBJECT Object of action. 
DATIVE Beneficiary or suffer of 
action.  
TRANSLATION English counterpart of per 
word or idiom.  
ECAT POS tagging of per English 
word or phrase.  
ILLUSTRATIONS Corpus-derived example 
sentences showing authen-
tic contexts of a word or 
idiom. 
Table 2 Semantic attributes in the verb database of SKCC 
 
To sum up, the above attributes fall into five 
kinds of information below:  
(1)  Basic information of entry, such as vocabulary 
item, part of speech, sub-category, homograph 
and pronunciation; 
(2)  Descriptions of word meaning, including sense 
number, definition, and semantic categories;  
(3)  Semantic valence, thematic roles and combina-
torial properties for per words; this is the most 
important part of SKCC and especially useful 
for WSD and lexical semantics research; 
(4)  English translation and its POS tagging. If a 
Chinese word has two or more English 
counterparts, it will be regarded as different 
entries respectively, and the collocation 
information will also be given in relevant 
fields. This can significantly improve the 
quality of Chinese-English MT system. 
(5)  Corpus-derived authentic examples of a word 
in context, showing how it is used, how 
phrases are formed around it, and so on. 
3 Application in WSD 
As a large-scale lexical knowledge base, SKCC 
combines the features of many of the other re-
sources commonly exploited in NLP work: it in-
cludes definitions and English translations for in-
dividual senses of words within it, as in a bilingual 
dictionary; it organizes lexical concepts into a con-
ceptual hierarchy, like a thesaurus; and it includes 
other links among words according to several se-
mantic relations, including semantic role, colloca-
tion information etc. As such it currently provides 
the broadest set of lexical information in a single 
resource. The kind of information recorded and 
made available through SKCC is of a type usable 
for various NLP applications, including machine 
translation, automatic abstraction, information re-
trieval, hypertext navigation, thematic analysis, 
and text processing.  
In this section, we shall focus on the automatic 
disambiguation of Chinese word senses involving 
SKCC since it is most troublesome, and essential 
for all the above NLP applications (Ide, 1998).  
3.1 Determination of the polysemous words 
and homographs 
In general terms, word sense disambiguation 
(WSD) task necessarily involves two steps: (1) the 
determination of all the polysemous words and 
homographs in the text or discourse; and (2) a 
means to assign each occurrence of a word to the 
appropriate sense. 
Step (1) can be easily accomplished by reliance 
on SKCC.  Firstly, each entry denotes one single 
sense of per word in SKCC. Thus, if a word has 
two or more senses, it will be regard as different 
entries, and the ?SENSE? field will be filled with 
different number (as ???in table 3). 
ENTRY ? 1 ? 2 
POS n n  
SENSE 1 2 
DEFINITION vegetable cooked vege-
table, egg, 
fish, meat...etc
TRANSLATION vegetable dish 
ILLUSTRATIONS ?? 
grow 
 vegetables 
?? 
potherb 
?? 
meat or fish 
????
four dishes 
and a bowl 
of soup 
Table 3 Two senses of Chinese noun ??? 
Secondly, SKCC marked all of the homo-
graphs in ?HOMOMORPHISM? field, such as two 
verbs ???with different pronunciation in table 4. 
ENTRY ? 1 ? 2 
PRONUNCIATION Kan4 Kan1 
HOMOMORPHISM A B  
DEFINITION see; 
watch; 
look at  
look after;
take care of
TRANSLATION see look after 
Table 4 Homographs in SKCC 
Therefore, if either of the ?SENSE? and 
?HOMOMORPHISM? fields is filled with value in 
SKCC, the entry must be a polysemous word or 
homograph. 
3.2 WSD based on semantic categories  
The senses of most Chinese polysemous words and 
homographs belong to different semantic catego-
ries, and have different syntagmatic features in 
context (Wang Hui, 2002) . SKCC gives detailed 
description of such information in ?AGENT? 
and/or ?OBJECT? fields as illustrated in table 5 
below. 
ENTRY ?? 1 ?? 2 
POS  a a 
SENSE 1 2 
DEFINITION (of food, 
drink, 
smell) 
light; 
weak  
(of business)
slack 
SEMANTIC 
CATEGORY 
taste condition 
AGENT food | drink| 
plant 
?business? 
TRANSLATION light slack  
Table 5 Polysemous adjectives in SKCC 
Based on the above description, the target 
word ???? in following POS-tagged text can be 
accurately disambiguated: 
[1]  ?/m ?/q ??/a ?/u ???/n  
A cup of light Longjing tea. 
[2]  ???/t ??/v ?/u ?/n ?/d ?/a ???/n 
??/d ??/a? 
When the season is busy, few farmers go to 
town and the business is rather slack. 
In sentence[1], the word modified by ???? 
is the noun???(tea) , which is a kind of ?drink?; 
while the word???? in sentence [2] is a predicate 
of ?business?.  According to the different values 
in ?AGENT? field, it is easy to judge that these 
two ???? belong to two semantic categories, viz. 
the former is ?light??and the latter is ?slack?. 
3.3 WSD based on collocation information 
As for the polysemous words or homographs be-
longing to the same semantic category, the differ-
ence between them usually manifests at the 
collocation level. According to a study in cognitive 
science, people often disambiguate word sense us-
ing only a few other words in a given context (fre-
quently only one additional word) ( Choueka, 
1983). Thus, the relationships between one word 
and others can be effectively used to resolve ambi-
guity. For example, Chinese verb ??? has two 
senses: one is ???? (look for) and the other is ?
??? (give change).  Only when the verb co-
occurs with the noun ??? (money), it can be inter-
preted as ?give change?; Otherwise, it means ?look 
for? (see table 6).  
ENTRY ? 1 ? 2 
HOMOMORPHISM A B 
SENSE 1 2 
DEFINITION look for; 
seek try to 
find;   
give change 
AGENT person entity 
OBJECT entity ?money? 
DATIVE  person 
TRANSLATION look for give change 
Table 6  Different senses of verb ???  
According to table 6, the verb ??? in sen-
tence [1] below must be ?look for?, because its 
object is ??? (person), a kind of ?entity?; while ?
??in sentence [2] has two objects, namely, indi-
rect object ?? ? (me) and direct object ??
?(money). Thus, its meaning is ?give change?. 
[1]??/r ?/d  ??/v  ?/v  ?/n? 
They will go out to look for sb. 
[2]???/n ?/d ??/d ?/v ?/r ?/n ? 
The seller has not given change to me. 
By making full use of SKCC and a large scale 
POS-tagged corpus of Chinese, a multi-levels 
WSD model is developed and has already been 
used in a Chinese-English MT application. 
4 Conclusion 
SKCC is a well-structured Chinese-English bilin-
gual semantic resource, as described in the paper, it 
has more than 66,000 Chinese words and their 
English counterparts classified, and the accurate 
description of about 1.5 million attributes further 
enriched the abundance of lexical semantic knowl-
edge. It not only provides a deductive system of 
word meaning and valuable semantic knowledge 
for Chinese language processing, but also has great 
theoretical significance in lexical semantics and 
computational lexicography research.
