Abstract
Language model information retrieval de-
pends on accurate estimation of document
models. In this paper, we propose a docu-
ment expansion technique to deal with the
problem of insufficient sampling of docu-
ments. We construct a probabilistic neigh-
borhood for each document, and expand
the document with its neighborhood infor-
mation. The expanded document provides
a more accurate estimation of the docu-
ment model, thus improves retrieval ac-
curacy. Moreover, since document expan-
sion and pseudo feedback exploit different
corpus structures, they can be combined to
further improve performance. The experi-
ment results on several different data sets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the pro-
posed document expansion method.
1 Introduction
Information retrieval with statistical language mod-
els (Lafferty and Zhai, 2003) has recently attracted
much more attention because of its solid theoreti-
cal background as well as its good empirical per-
formance. In this approach, queries and documents
are assumed to be sampled from hidden generative
models, and the similarity between a document and
a query is then calculated through the similarity be-
tween their underlying models.
Clearly, good retrieval performance relies on the
accurate estimation of the query and document mod-
els. Indeed, smoothing of document models has
been proved to be very critical (Chen and Good-
man, 1998; Kneser and Ney, 1995; Zhai and Laf-
ferty, 2001b). The need for smoothing originated
from the zero count problem: when a term does not
occur in a document, the maximum likelihood esti-
mator would give it a zero probability. This is un-
reasonable because the zero count is often due to in-
sufficient sampling, and a larger sample of the data
would likely contain the term. Smoothing is pro-
posed to address the problem.
While most smoothing methods utilize the global
collection information with a simple interpolation
(Ponte and Croft, 1998; Miller et al, 1999; Hiemstra
and Kraaij, 1998; Zhai and Lafferty, 2001b), sev-
eral recent studies (Liu and Croft, 2004; Kurland and
Lee, 2004) have shown that local corpus structures
can be exploited to improve retrieval performance.
In this paper, we further study the use of local cor-
pus structures for document model estimation and
propose to use document expansion to better exploit
local corpus structures for estimating document lan-
guage models.
According to statistical principles, the accuracy of
a statistical estimator is largely determined by the
sampling size of the observed data; a small data
set generally would result in large variances, thus
can not be trusted completely. Unfortunately, in re-
trieval, we often have to estimate a model based on a
single document. Since a document is a small sam-
ple, our estimate is unlikely to be very accurate.
A natural improvement is to enlarge the data sam-
ple, ideally in a document-specific way. Ideally, the
enlarged data sample should come from the same
original generative model. In reality, however, since
407
the underlying model is unknown to us, we would
not really be able to obtain such extra data. The
essence of this paper is to use document expansion
to obtain high quality extra data to enlarge the sam-
ple of a document so as to improve the accuracy
of the estimated document language model. Docu-
ment expansion was previously explored in (Sing-
hal and Pereira, 1999) in the context of the vec-
tor space retrieval model, mainly involving selecting
more terms from similar documents. Our work dif-
fers from this previous work in that we study doc-
ument expansion in the language modeling frame-
work and implement the idea quite differently.
Our main idea is to augment a document prob-
abilistically with potentially all other documents in
the collection that are similar to the document. The
probability associated with each neighbor document
reflects how likely the neighbor document is from
the underlying distribution of the original document,
thus we have a ?probabilistic neighborhood?, which
can serve as ?extra data? for the document for es-
timating the underlying language model. From the
viewpoint of smoothing, our method extends the ex-
isting work on using clusters for smoothing (Liu and
Croft, 2004) to allow each document to have its own
cluster for smoothing.
We evaluated our method using six representative
retrieval test sets. The experiment results show that
document expansion smoothing consistently outper-
forms the baseline smoothing methods in all the data
sets. It also outperforms a state-of-the-art cluster-
ing smoothing method. Analysis shows that the
improvement tends to be more significant for short
documents, indicating that the improvement indeed
comes from the improved estimation of the docu-
ment language model, since a short document pre-
sumably would benefit more from the neighborhood
smoothing. Moreover, since document expansion
and pseudo feedback exploit different corpus struc-
tures, they can be combined to further improve per-
formance. As document expansion can be done in
the indexing stage, it is scalable to large collections.
2 Document Expansion Retrieval Model
2.1 The KL-divergence retrieval model
We first briefly review the KL-divergence retrieval
model, on which we will develop the document
expansion technique. The KL-divergence model
is a representative state-of-the-art language model-
ing approach for retrieval. It covers the basic lan-
guage modeling approach (i.e., the query likelihood
method) as a special case and can support feedback
more naturally.
In this approach, a query and a document are as-
sumed to be generated from a unigram query lan-
guage model ?Q and a unigram document languagemodel ?D, respectively. Given a query and a docu-ment, we would first compute an estimate of the cor-
responding query model (??Q) and document model
(??D), and then score the document w.r.t. the querybased on the KL-divergence of the two models (Laf-
ferty and Zhai, 2001):
D(??Q || ??d) =
?
w?V
p(w|??Q) ? log
p(w|??Q)
p(w|??d)
.
where V is the set of all the words in our vocabulary.
The documents can then be ranked according to the
ascending order of the KL-divergence values.
Clearly, the two fundamental problems in such a
model are to estimate the query model and the doc-
ument model, and the accuracy of our estimation of
these models would affect the retrieval performance
significantly. The estimation of the query model
can often be improved by exploiting the local cor-
pus structure in a way similar to pseudo-relevance
feedback (Lafferty and Zhai, 2001; Lavrenko and
Croft, 2001; Zhai and Lafferty, 2001a). The esti-
mation of the document model is most often done
through smoothing with the global collection lan-
guage model (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001b), though re-
cently there has been some work on using clusters
for smoothing (Liu and Croft, 2004). Our work is
mainly to extend the previous work on document
smoothing and improve the accuracy of estimation
by better exploiting the local corpus structure. We
now discuss all these in detail.
2.2 Smoothing of document models
Given a document d, the simplest way to estimate
the document language model is to treat the docu-
ment as a sample from the underlying multinomial
word distribution and use the maximum likelihood
estimator: P (w|??d) = c(w,d)|d| , where c(w, d) isthe count of word w in document d, and |d| is the
408
length of d. However, as discussed in virtually all
the existing work on using language models for re-
trieval, such an estimate is problematic and inaccu-
rate; indeed, it would assign zero probability to any
word not present in document d, causing problems
in scoring a document with query likelihood or KL-
divergence (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001b). Intuitively,
such an estimate is inaccurate because the document
is a small sample.
To solve this problem, many different smoothing
techniques have been proposed and studied, usually
involving some kind of interpolation of the maxi-
mum likelihood estimate and a global collection lan-
guage model (Hiemstra and Kraaij, 1998; Miller et
al., 1999; Zhai and Lafferty, 2001b). For exam-
ple, Jelinek-Mercer(JM) and Dirichlet are two com-
monly used smoothing methods (Zhai and Lafferty,
2001b). JM smoothing uses a fixed parameter ? to
control the interpolation:
P (w|??d) = ?
c(w, d)
|d| + (1 ? ?)P (w|?C),
while the Dirichlet smoothing uses a document-
dependent coefficient (parameterized with ?) to con-
trol the interpolation:
P (w|??d) =
c(w, d) + ?P (w|?C)
|d| + ? .
Here P (w|?C) is the probability of word w given bythe collection language model ?C , which is usuallyestimated using the whole collection of documents
C , e.g., P (w|?C) =
P
d?C c(d,w)
P
d?C |d|
.
2.3 Cluster-based document model (CBDM)
Recently, the cluster structure of the corpus has been
exploited to improve language models for retrieval
(Kurland and Lee, 2004; Liu and Croft, 2004). In
particular, the cluster-based language model pro-
posed in (Liu and Croft, 2004) uses clustering infor-
mation to further smooth a document model. It di-
vides all documents into K different clusters (K =
1000 in their experiments). Both cluster informa-
tion and collection information are used to improve
the estimate of the document model:
P (w|??d) = ?
c(w, d)
|d| + (1 ? ?)
?[?P (w|?Ld) + (1 ? ?)P (w|?C )],
where ?Ld stands for document d?s cluster modeland ? and ? are smoothing parameters. In this
clustering-based smoothing method, we first smooth
a cluster model with the collection model using
Dirichlet smoothing, and then use smoothed cluster
model as a new reference model to further smooth
the document model using JM smoothing; empirical
results show that the added cluster information in-
deed enhances retrieval performance (Liu and Croft,
2004).
2.4 Document expansion
From the viewpoint of data augmentation, the
clustering-based language model can be regarded as
?expanding? a document with more data from the
cluster that contains the document. This is intu-
itively better than simply expanding every document
with the same collection language model as in the
case of JM or Dirichlet smoothing. Looking at it
from this perspective, we see that, as the ?extra data?
for smoothing a document model, the cluster con-
taining the document is often not optimal. Indeed,
the purpose of clustering is to group similar doc-
uments together, hence a cluster model represents
well the overall property of all the documents in the
cluster. However, such an average model is often not
accurate for smoothing each individual document.
We illustrate this problem in Figure 1(a), where we
show two documents d and a in cluster D. Clearly
the generative model of cluster D is more suitable
for smoothing document a than document d. In gen-
eral, the cluster model is more suitable for smooth-
ing documents close to the centroid, such as a, but is
inaccurate for smoothing a document at the bound-
ary, such as d.
To achieve optimal smoothing, each document
should ideally have its own cluster centered on the
document, as shown in Figure 1(b). This is pre-
cisely what we propose ? expanding each document
with a probabilistic neighborhood around the doc-
ument and estimate the document model based on
such a virtual, expanded document. We can then ap-
ply any simple interpolation-based method (e.g., JM
or Dirichlet) to such a ?virtual document? and treat
the word counts given by this ?virtual document? as
if they were the original word counts.
The use of neighborhood information is worth
more discussion. First of all, neighborhood is not a
409

d?s neighbors

a

pansion
clearly defined concept. In the narrow sense, only
a few documents close to the original one should
be included in the neighborhood, while in the wide
sense, the whole collection can be potentially in-
cluded. It is thus a challenge to define the neighbor-
hood concept reasonably. Secondly, the assumption
that neighbor documents are sampled from the same
generative model as the original document is not
completely valid. We probably do not want to trust
them so much as the original one. We solve these
two problems by associating a confidence value with
every document in the collection, which reflects our
belief that the document is sampled from the same
underlying model as the original document. When a
document is close to the original one, we have high
confidence, but when it is farther apart, our confi-
dence would fade away. In this way, we construct
a probabilistic neighborhood which can potentially
include all the documents with different confidence
values. We call a language model based on such a
neighborhood document expansion language model
(DELM).
Technically, we are looking for a new enlarged
document d? for each document d in a text collec-
tion, such that the new document d? can be used
to estimate the hidden generative model of d more
accurately. Since a good d? should presumably be
based on both the original document d and its neigh-
borhood N(d), we define a function ?:
d? = ?(d,N(d)). (1)
The precise definition of the neighborhood con-
cept N(d) relies on the distance or similarity be-
tween each pair of documents. Here, we simply
choose the commonly used cosine similarity, though
other choices may also be possible. Given any two
document models X and Y , the cosine similarity is

defined as:
sim(X,Y ) =
?
i xi ? yi
?
?
i(xi)2 ?
?
i(yi)2
.
To model the uncertainty of neighborhood, we as-
sign a confidence value ?d(b) to every document b inthe collection to indicate how strongly we believe b
is sampled from d?s hidden model. In general, ?d(b)can be set based on the similarity of b and d ? the
more similar b and d are, the larger ?d(b) wouldbe. With these confidence values, we construct a
probabilistic neighborhood with every document in
it, each with a different weight. The whole problem
is thus reduced to how to define ?d(b) exactly.Intuitively, an exponential decay curve can help
regularize the influence from remote documents. We
therefore want ?d(b) to satisfy a normal distributioncentered around d. Figure 2 illustrates the shape
of this distribution. The black dots are neighbor-
hood documents centered around d. Their proba-
bility values are determined by their distances to the
center. We fortunately observe that the cosine sim-
ilarities, which we use to decide the neighborhood,
are roughly of this decay shape. We thus use them
directly without further transformation because that
would introduce unnecessary parameters. We set
?d(b) by normalizing the cosine similarity scores :
?d(b) =
sim(d, b)
?
b??C?{d} sim(d, b?)
.
Function ? serves to balance the confidence be-
tween d and its neighborhood N(d) in the model es-
timation step. Intuitively, a shorter document is less
sufficient, hence needs more help from its neighbor-
hood. Conversely, a longer one can rely more on
itself. We use a parameter ? to control this balance.
Thus finally, we obtain a pseudo document d? with
410
the following pseudo term count:
c(w, d?) = ?c(w, d) + (1 ? ?)
?
?
b?C?{d}
(?d(b) ? c(w, b)),
We hypothesize that, in general, ?d can be estimatedmore accurately from d? rather than d itself because
d? contains more complete information about ?d.This hypothesis can be tested by by comparing the
retrieval results of applying any smoothing method
to d with those of applying the same method to d?.
In our experiments, we will test this hypothesis with
both JM smoothing and Dirichlet smoothing.
Note that the proposed document expansion tech-
nique is quite general. Indeed, since it transforms
the original document to a potentially better ?ex-
panded document?, it can presumably be used to-
gether with any retrieval method, including the vec-
tor space model. In this paper, we focus on evalu-
ating this technique with the language modeling ap-
proach.
Because of the decay shape of the neighborhood
and for the sake of efficiency, we do not have to ac-
tually use all documents in C?{d}. Instead, we can
safely cut off the documents on the tail, and only use
the top M closest neighbors for each document. We
show in the experiment section that the performance
is not sensitive to the choice of M when M is suf-
ficiently large (for example 100). Also, since doc-
ument expansion can be done completely offline, it
can scale up to large collections.
3 Experiments
We evaluate the proposed method over six repre-
sentative TREC data sets (Voorhees and Harman,
2001): AP (Associated Press news 1988-90), LA
(LA Times), WSJ (Wall Street Journal 1987-92),
SJMN (San Jose Mercury News 1991), DOE (De-
partment of Energy), and TREC8 (the ad hoc data
used in TREC8). Table 1 shows the statistics of these
data.
We choose the first four TREC data sets for per-
formance comparison with (Liu and Croft, 2004).
To ensure that the comparison is meaningful, we use
identical sources (after all preprocessing). In addi-
tion, we use the large data set TREC8 to show that
our algorithm can scale up, and use DOE because its

rience shows that it is a relatively difficult data set.
3.1 Neighborhood document expansion
Our model boils down to a standard query likelihood
model when no neighborhood document is used. We
therefore use two most commonly used smoothing
methods, JM and Dirichlet , as our baselines. The re-
sults are shown in Table 2, where we report both the
mean average precision (MAP) and precision at 10
documents. JM and Dirichlet indicate the standard
language models with JM smoothing and Dirichlet
smoothing respectively, and the other two are the
ones combined with our document expansion. For
both baselines, we tune the parameters (? for JM,
and ? for Dirichlet) to be optimal. We then use the
same values of ? or ? without further tuning for the
document expansion runs, which means that the pa-
rameters may not necessarily optimal for the docu-
ment expansion runs. Despite this disadvantage, we
see that the document expansion runs significantly
outperform their corresponding baselines, with more
than 15% relative improvement on AP. The parame-
ters M and ? were set to 100 and 0.5, respectively.
To understand the improvement in more detail, we
show the precision values at different levels of recall
for the AP data in Table 3. Here we see that our
method significantly outperforms the baseline at ev-
ery precision point.
In our model, we introduce two additional param-
eters: M and ?. We first examine M here, and then
study ? in Section 3.3. Figure 3 shows the perfor-
mance trend with respect to the values of M . The
x-axis is the values of M , and the y-axis is the non-
interpolated precision averaging over all 50 queries.
We draw two conclusions from this plot: (1) Neigh-
borhood information improves retrieval accuracy;
adding more documents leads to better retrieval re-
sults. (2) The performance becomes insensitive to

M when M is sufficiently large, namely 100. The
reason is twofold: First, since the neighborhood is
centered around the original document, when M is
large, the expansion may be evenly magnified on all
term dimensions. Second, the exponentially decay-
ing confidence values reduce the influence of remote
documents.
3.2 Comparison with CBDM
In this section, we compare the CBDM method us-
ing the model performing the best in (Liu and Croft,
2004)1. Furthermore, we also set Dirichlet prior pa-
rameter ? = 1000, as mentioned in (Liu and Croft,
2004), to rule out any potential influence of Dirichlet
smoothing.
Table 4 shows that our model outperforms CBDM
in MAP values on four data sets; the improvement

presumably comes from a more principled way of
exploiting corpus structures. Given that clustering
can at least capture the local structure to some ex-
tent, it should not be very surprising that the im-
provement of document expansion over CBDM is
much less than that over the baselines.
Note that we cannot fulfill Wilcoxon test because
of the lack of the individual query results of CBDM.
3.3 Impact on short documents
Document expansion is to solve the insufficient sam-
pling problem. Intuitively, a short document is less
sufficient than a longer one, hence would need more
?help? from its neighborhood. We design experi-
ments to test this hypothesis.
Specifically, we randomly shrink each document
in AP88-89 to a certain percentage of its original
length. For example, a shrinkage factor of 30%
means each term has 30% chance to stay, or 70%
chance to be filtered out. In this way, we reduce the
original data set to a new one with the same number

Table 5 shows the experiment results over docu-
ment sets with different average document lengths.
The results indeed support our hypothesis that doc-
ument expansion does help short documents more
than longer ones. While we can manage to improve
41% on a 30%-length corpus, the same model only
gets 16% improvement on the full length corpus.
To understand how ? affects the performance we
plot the sensitivity curves in Figure 4. The curves all
look similar, but the optimal points slightly migrate
when the average document length becomes shorter.
A 100% corpus gets optimal at ? = 0.4, but 30%
corpus has to use ? = 0.2 to obtain its optimum.
(All optimal ? values are presented in the fourth row
of Table 5.)
3.4 Further improvement with pseudo
feedback
Query expansion has been proved to be an effec-
tive way of utilizing corpus information to improve
the query representation (Rocchio, 1971; Zhai and
Lafferty, 2001a). It is thus interesting to examine
whether our model can be combined with query ex-
pansion to further improve the retrieval accuracy.
We use the model-based feedback proposed in (Zhai
and Lafferty, 2001a) and take top 5 returned docu-
ments for feedback. There are two parameters in the
model-based pseudo feedback process: the noisy pa-

rameter ? and the interpolation parameter ?2. We fix
? = 0.9 and tune ? to optimal, and use them directly
in the feedback process combined with our models.
(It again means that ? is probably not optimal in our
results.) The combination is conducted in the fol-
lowing way: (1) Retrieve documents by our DELM
method; (2) Choose top 5 document to do the model-
based feedback; (3) Use the expanded query model
to retrieve documents again with DELM method.
Table 6 shows the experiment results (MAP); in-
deed, by combining DELM with pseudo feedback,
we can obtain significant further improvement of
performance.
As another baseline, we also tested the algorithm
proposed in (Kurland and Lee, 2004). Since the al-
gorithm overlaps with pseudo feedback process, it is
not easy to further combine them. We implement its
best-performing algorithm, ?interpolation? (labeled
as inter. ), and show the results in Table 7. Here,
we use the same three data sets as used in (Kurland
and Lee, 2004). We tune the feedback parameters to
optimal in each experiment. The second last column
in Table 7 shows the performance of combination of
the ?interpolation? model with the pseudo feedback
and its improvement percentage. The last column is
the z-scores of Wilcoxon test. The negative z-scores
indicate that none of the improvement is significant.
2 (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001a) uses different notations. We
change them because ? has already been used in our own
model.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, we proposed a novel document expan-
sion method to enrich the document sample through
exploiting the local corpus structure. Unlike pre-
vious cluster-based models, we smooth each doc-
ument using a probabilistic neighborhood centered
around the document itself.
Experiment results show that (1) The proposed
document expansion method outperforms both the
?no expansion? baselines and the cluster-based mod-
els. (2) Our model is relatively insensitive to the set-
ting of parameter M as long as it is sufficiently large,
while the parameter ? should be set according to the
document length; short documents need a smaller
? to obtain more help from its neighborhood. (3)
Document expansion can be combined with pseudo
feedback to further improve performance. Since any
retrieval model can be presumably applied on top of
the expanded documents, we believe that the pro-
posed technique can be potentially useful for any re-
trieval model.

Abstract 
This paper describes the Chinese Word 
Segmenter for our participation in CIPS-
SIGHAN-2010 bake-off task of Chinese 
word segmentation. We formalize the tasks 
as sequence tagging problems, and 
implemented them using conditional random 
fields (CRFs) model. The system contains two 
modules: multiple preprocessor and basic 
segmenter. The basic segmenter is designed as 
a problem of character-based tagging, and 
using named entity recognition and chunk 
recognition based on boundary to preprocess. 
We participated in the open training on 
Simplified Chinese Text and Traditional 
Chinese Text, and our system achieved one 
Rank#5 and four Rank#2 best in all four 
domain corpus. 
1 Introduction 
Word is a logical semantic and syntactic unit 
in natural language (Zhenxing Wang, 2008).  
Chinese word segmentation is very important for 
Chinese language processing, which aims to 
recognize the implicit word boundaries in 
Chinese text.  It is the foundation of most 
Chinese NLP tasks. In past decades, great 
success has been achieved in Chinese word 
segmentation (Nie, et al 1995; Wang et al 
2000;Zhang, et al 2002). But there still exist 
many problems, such as cross-domain 
performance of Chinese word segmentation 
algorithms. As the development of the internet, 
more and more new word has been appearing, 
Improving the  performance of Chinese word 
segmentation algorithms on OOV (Out-Of-
Vocabulary Word, is a word which occurs in the 
reference corpus but does not occur in the 
labeled training corpus) is the important research 
direction. Our system participated in the CIPS-
SIGHAN-2010 bake-off task of Chinese word 
segmentation. And we have done work in dealing 
with two main sub-tasks: (1) Word Segmentation 
for Simplified Chinese Text, (2) Word 
Segmentation for Traditional Chinese Text. Our 
system formalizes these tasks as consecutive 
sequence tagging problems, and learns the 
segmentation using conditional random fields 
approach. Our system contains two modules, a 
multiple preprocessor and a basic segmenter. The 
multiple preprocessor first finds chunks based on 
boundary dictionary and then uses named entity 
recognition technology to extract the person, 
location, organization and special time. The basic 
segmenter using CRF model is trained to 
segment the sentence to word which contains one 
or more characters. The basic segmenter follows 
the study of Zhenxing Wang, Changning Huang 
and Jingbo Zhu (2008), but applies more refined 
features and tags.  
The reminder of the paper is organized as 
follows. In section 2, we briefly describe the task 
and the details of our system. The experimental 
results are discussed in section 3. In section 4 we 
put forward our conclusion. 
2 System Description  
In this section we describe our system in more 
detail. The Figure1 is the frame of our system. It 
contains two modules: multiple preprocessor and 
basic segmenter. 
 
2.1 Multiple Preprocessor 
The preprocessor contain two modules: 
chunking based on boundary dictionary and NE 
Reorganization.  
2.1.1 Chunking 
In one sentence, there are always some  
characters or  words, such as ???, ???,???,?
?? ?, the character adjacent them can not  
together with them. We define these characters 
or words as boundary word. We built a boundary 
dictionary manual, which contains about 100 
words. Once a  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure1. Chinese Word Segmenter 
 
sentence input, our system finds boundary words 
in the sentence first. For example, such as, ???
??????????????? 15?? 16
?????????????. In this sentence 
we can find the boundary word??? ??? ??? ?
?? ? ???. Then chunking result is shown 
below in Figure 2. Using ?[ ]? to mark up the 
chunks. 
 
[???]  ?  [?????]  ?  [????] 
??  ?  [15?]  ?  [16?]  ?  [????] 
[??????] 
Figure 2. a sentence with chunk in data set 
 
Chunking is very useful to improve the precision 
of segmentation. Especially when lacking 
enough training corpus for training CRF model. 
It can improve the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) 
word Recall and Precision on cross-domain 
Chinese word segmentation. 
 
2.1.2 NE Recognition 
We will recognize the named entities such as 
persons, locations organizations. We perform a 
process of the named entities recognition with 
forward-backward maximum matching algorithm 
based on entity dictionary. The dictionary 
contain location dictionary, person dictionary, 
family name dictionary, organization dictionary, 
country dictionary (Jianping Shen and Xuan 
Wang, 2010). For example, a sentence, ????
???????????????????
???????????. And  the processor 
will find out the location????,????, the 
family name ??? and person ????. The NE 
recognition result is shown below in Figure 3.

2.2 Basic Segmenter 
We model the segment task as the consecutive 
sequence labeling problems, such as chunking, 
and named entity recognition, and train the basic 
segmenter using conditional random fields 
approach (Lafferty et al, 2001). 
 
2.2.1 Conditional Random Fields 
CRF models are conditional probabilistic 
sequence and undirected graphical models 
CRF models hold two natures. First is the 
conditional nature, second the exponential nature. 
The conditional nature of the distribution over 
label sequence allows CRF models to model 
real-world data in which the conditional 
probability of a label sequence can depend on 
non-independent and interacting features of the 
observation sequence. The exponential nature of 
the distribution enables features of different 
states to be traded off against each other, 
weighting some states in a sequence as being 
more important than other states. Following 
Lafferty et al and Hanna Wallach, the 
exponential distribution chosen by John Lafferty 
et al is shown as follow: 
( ) (

if y y and x x

    =   =?= ?                   ?  
In this situation, the parameters ',y y
?
and 
,y x? corresponding to these features are 
equivalent to the logarithms of the HMM 
transition and emission probabilities 
and . The parameter of the 
model can be estimated in many ways, such as 
GIS, IIS, L-BFGS etc.

2.2.2 Segment base on CRF model 
When a sentence or chunk (which get from the 
preprocessor) input, it will be split to the 
sequences shown in Figure 4.

Figure  4. Chunk and sequence 
Every character in input sentences will be 
given a label which indicates whether this 
character is a word boundary. Our basic 
segmenter is almost the same as the system 
described in (Zhao et al, 2006) which is learned 
from training corpus. The CRF model we use is 
implemented with CRF++ 0.51. The parameters 
of the CRF segmenter are set as defaults. 
Under the CRF tagging scheme, each 
character in one sentence will be given a label by 
CRF model to indicate which position this 
character occupies in a word. In our system, CRF 
tag set is proposed to distinguish different 
positions in the multi-character words when the 
word length is less than 6, namely 6-tag set {B, 
B2, B3, M, E, O}( Zhenxing Wang ,2008).We 
defined that B stands for the first and  E stands 
for  the last position in a multi-character word. S 
stands up a single-character word. B2 and B3 
stand for the second and the third position in a 
multi-character word. M stands for the fourth or 
more rear position in a multi-character word, 
whose length is larger than four-character. Then 
we add the entity tag set {B-entity, I-entity, E-
entity}. B-entity stands for the first character in a 
named entity, E-entity stands for the last 
character in a named entity, and I-entity stands 
for the other character in a named entity. 
We use a greedy forward procedure to select a 
better feature sets for the segementer according 
to the evaluation results in the development set. 
We first start from a basic feature set, and then 
add each feature outside the basic set and remove 
each feature inside the basic set one by one to 
check the effectiveness of each feature by the 
performance change in the development set. This 
procedure is repeated until no feature is added or 
removed or the performance is not improved. 
The selected features are listed below:  
? Cn (n=-2,-1, 0, 1, 2) 
? CnCn+1 (n=-1,0) 
? Cn-1CnCn+1 (n=-1,0,1) 
? Cn-2Cn-1CnCn+1  (n=0,1) 
Where C refer to the tag of each character, and 
C0 denotes current character and Cn(C-n) 
denotes the character n positions to the right (left) 
of current character.  
 
2.2.3 Post-processing 
We can obtain the preliminary results through 
the CRF model-based Segment, but there are 
some missed or incorrect cases for the digit, 
English word. For example ?the sighan? maybe 
segment to ?th e sig han?, so we will re-segment 
the ?th e sig han? as ?the sighan?. 
 
3 Performance and Analysis 
In this section we will present our 
experimental results for these two subtasks. For 
the Word Segmentation for Simplified Chinese 
Text subtask, comparing the performance of 
these four domains, we find that the performance 
of computer and finance are better than literature 
and medical.  We can find that the OOV RR of 
literature and medical are lower than the 
computer and finance. In the test data set, there 
are many Out-of-vocabulary(OOV), especially 
the disease. In medical domain, there are many 
diseases which do not appear in the corpus, and 
there is the proper name. The segment often 
can?t recognize disease well, so we add a post-
processing procedure, using domain dictionary 
for medicine, is used to increase the recall 
measure. The result for medical is shown in 
Table 2.

4 Conclusion 
Through the CIPS-SIGHAN bakeoff, we find 
our system is effective. And at the same time, we 
also find some problems of us. Our system still 
can?t performance very good in cross-domain. 
Especially the Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) 
recognition. From the experiment we can see that 
using domain dictionary is a good idea. In the 
future we will do more work in post-processing. 
The bakeoff points out the direction for us to 
improve our system.
