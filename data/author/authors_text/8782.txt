Abstract
This paper investigates the problem of boot-
strapping a statistical dialogue manager with-
out access to training data and proposes a new
probabilistic agenda-based method for simu-
lating user behaviour. In experiments with a
statistical POMDP dialogue system, the simu-
lator was realistic enough to successfully test
the prototype system and train a dialogue pol-
icy. An extensive study with human subjects
showed that the learned policy was highly com-
petitive, with task completion rates above 90%.
1 Background and Introduction
1.1 Bootstrapping Statistical Dialogue Managers
One of the key advantages of a statistical approach to Dia-
logue Manager (DM) design is the ability to formalise de-
sign criteria as objective reward functions and to learn an
optimal dialogue policy from real dialogue data. In cases
where a system is designed from scratch, however, it is
often the case that no suitable in-domain data is available
for training the DM. Collecting dialogue data without a
working prototype is problematic, leaving the developer
with a classic chicken-and-egg problem.
Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) experiments can be carried out to
record dialogues, but they are often time-consuming and
the recorded data may show characteristics of human-
human conversation rather than typical human-computer
dialogue. Alternatively, human-computer dialogues can
be recorded with a handcrafted DM prototype but neither
of these two methods enables the system designer to test
the implementation of the statistical DM and the learn-
ing algorithm. Moreover, the size of the recorded corpus
(typically  103 dialogues) usually falls short of the re-
quirements for training a statistical DM (typically 104
dialogues).
1.2 User Simulation-Based Training
In recent years, a number of research groups have inves-
tigated the use of a two-stage simulation-based setup. A
statistical user model is first trained on a limited amount
of dialogue data and the model is then used to simulate
dialogues with the interactively learning DM (see Schatz-
mann et al (2006) for a literature review).
The simulation-based approach assumes the presence
of a small corpus of suitably annotated in-domain dia-
logues or out-of-domain dialogues with a matching dia-
logue format (Lemon et al, 2006). In cases when no such
data is available, handcrafted values can be assigned to
the model parameters given that the model is sufficiently
simple (Levin et al, 2000; Pietquin and Dutoit, 2005) but
the performance of dialogue policies learned this way has
not been evaluated using real users.
1.3 Paper Outline
This paper presents a new probabilistic method for simu-
lating user behaviour based on a compact representation
of the user goal and a stack-like user agenda. The model
provides an elegant way of encoding the relevant dialogue
history from a user?s point of view and has a very small
parameter set so that manually chosen priors can be used
to bootstrap the DM training and testing process.
In experiments presented in this paper, the agenda-
based simulator was used to train a statistical POMDP-
based (Young, 2006; Young et al, 2007) DM. Even with-
out any training of its model parameters, the agenda-
based simulator was able to produce dialogue behaviour
realistic enough to train a competitive dialogue policy.
An extensive study1 with 40 human subjects showed that
task completion with the learned policy was above 90%
despite a mix of native and non-native speakers.

Project. The system evaluation was conducted in collabora-
tion with O. Lemon, K. Georgila and J. Henderson at Edinburgh

2 Agenda-Based Simulation
2.1 User Simulation at a Semantic Level
Human-machine dialogue can be formalised on a seman-
tic level as a sequence of state transitions and dialogue
acts2. At any time t, the user is in a state S, takes ac-
tion a
u
, transitions into the intermediate state S?, receives
machine action a
m
, and transitions into the next state S??
where the cycle restarts.
S ? a
u
? S
?
? a
m
? S
??
? ? ? ? (1)
Assuming a Markovian state representation, user be-
haviour can be decomposed into three models: P (a
u
|S)
for action selection, P (S?|a
u
, S) for the state transition
into S?, and P (S??|a
m
, S
?
) for the transition into S??.
2.2 Goal- and Agenda-Based State Representation
Inspired by agenda-based methods to dialogue manage-
ment (Wei and Rudnicky, 1999) the approach described
here factors the user state into an agenda A and a goal G.
S = (A,G) and G = (C,R) (2)
During the course of the dialogue, the goal G ensures that
the user behaves in a consistent, goal-directed manner.
G consists of constraints C which specify the required
venue, eg. a centrally located bar serving beer, and re-
quests R which specify the desired pieces of information,
eg. the name, address and phone number (cf. Fig. 1).
The user agenda A is a stack-like structure containing
the pending user dialogue acts that are needed to elicit the
information specified in the goal. At the start of the dia-
logue a new goal is randomly generated using the system
database and the agenda is initially populated by convert-
ing all goal constraints into inform acts and all goal re-
quests into request acts. A bye act is added at the bottom
of the agenda to close the dialogue.
As the dialogue progresses the agenda and goal are dy-
namically updated and acts are selected from the top of
the agenda to form user acts a
u
. In response to incom-
ing machine acts a
m
, new user acts are pushed onto the
agenda and no longer relevant ones are removed. The
agenda thus serves as a convenient way of tracking the
progress of the dialogue as well as encoding the rele-
vant dialogue history. Acts can also be temporarily stored
when actions of higher priority need to be issued first,
hence providing the simulator with a simple model of
user memory3.
2In this paper, the terms dialogue act and dialogue action
are used interchangeably. The notation act(a=x, b=y,...) is used
to represent a dialogue act of a given type act (such as inform
or request with items a = x, b = y, etc.
3See Fig. 1, turns 1-3, for an example: System turn 1 ?What
pricerange?? triggers the user act inform(pricerange=cheap)
to be pushed onto the agenda but it is not executed until turn 3
because negate(drinks=beer) is issued first.

Figure 1: Sample dialogue and agenda sequence
2.3 User Act Selection
At any time during the dialogue, the updated agenda of
length N contains all dialogue acts the user intends to
convey to the system. Since the agenda is ordered ac-
cording to priority, with A[N ] denoting the top and A[1]
denoting the bottom item, selecting the next user act sim-
plifies to popping n items off the top of the stack. Hence,
letting a
u
[i] denote the ith item in the user act a
u
a
u
[i] := A[N ? n + i] ?i ? [1..n], 1 ? n ? N. (3)
Using A[N?n+1..N ] as a Matlab-like shorthand nota-
150
tion for the top n items on A, the action selection model
becomes a Dirac delta function
P (a
u
|S) = P (a
u
|A,G) = ?(a
u
, A[N? n+1..N ]) (4)
where the random variable n corresponds to the level
of initiative taken by the simulated user. In a statistical
model the probability distribution over integer values for
n should be conditioned on A and learned from dialogue
data. For the purposes of bootstrapping the system, n can
be assumed independent of A and any distribution P (n)
that places the majority of its probability mass on small
values of n can be used.
2.4 State Transition Model
The factorisation of S into A and G can now be ap-
plied to the state transition models P (S?|a
u
, S) and
P (S
??
|a
m
, S
?
). Letting A? denote the agenda after select-
ing a
u
(as explained in the previous subsection) and using
N
?
= N ? n to denote the size of A?, we have
A
?
[i] := A[i] ?i ? [1..N
?
]. (5)
Using this definition of A? and assuming that the goal
remains constant when the user executes a
u
, the first state
transition depending on a
u
simplifies to
P (S
?
|a
u
, S) = P (A
?
, G
?
|a
u
, A,G)
= ?(A
?
, A[1..N
?
])?(G
?
, G). (6)
Using S = (A,G), the chain rule of probability, and rea-
sonable conditional independence assumptions, the sec-
ond state transition based on a
m
can be decomposed into
goal update and agenda update modules:
P (S
??
|a
m
, S
?
)
= P (A
??
|a
m
, A
?
, G
??
)
? ?? ?
agenda update
P (G
??
|a
m
, G
?
)
? ?? ?
goal update
. (7)
When no restrictions are placed on A?? and G??, the space
of possible state transitions is vast. The model parame-
ter set is too large to be handcrafted and even substantial
amounts of training data would be insufficient to obtain
reliable estimates. It can however be assumed that A?? is
derived from A? and that G?? is derived from G? and that
in each case the transition entails only a limited number
of well-defined atomic operations.
2.5 Agenda Update Model for System Acts
The agenda transition from A? to A?? can be viewed as a
sequence of push-operations in which dialogue acts are
added to the top of the agenda. In a second ?clean-up?
step, duplicate dialogue acts, null() acts, and unnecessary
request() acts for already filled goal request slots must
be removed but this is a deterministic procedure so that it
can be excluded in the following derivation for simplicity.
Considering only the push-operations, the items 1 to N ?
at the bottom of the agenda remain fixed and the update
model can be rewritten as follows:
P (A
??
|a
m
, A
?
, G
??
)
= P (A
??
[1..N
??
]|a
m
, A
?
[1..N
?
], G
??
) (8)
= P (A
??
[N
?
+1..N
??
]|a
m
, G
??
)
? ?(A
??
[1..N
?
], A
?
[1..N
?
]). (9)
The first term on the RHS of Eq. 9 can now be further
simplified by assuming that every dialogue act item in
a
m
triggers one push-operation. This assumption can be
made without loss of generality, because it is possible to
push a null() act (which is later removed) or to push an
act with more than one item. The advantage of this as-
sumption is that the known number M of items in a
m
now determines the number of push-operations. Hence
N
??
= N
?
+ M and
P (A
??
[N
?
+1..N
??
]|a
m
, G
??
)
= P (A
??
[N
?
+1..N
?
+M ]|a
m
[1..M ], G
??
) (10)
=
M
?
i=1
P (A
??
[N
?
+i]|a
m
[i], G
??
) (11)
The expression in Eq. 11 shows that each item a
m
[i] in
the system act triggers one push operation, and that this
operation is conditioned on the goal. This model is now
simple enough to be handcrafted using heuristics. For ex-
ample, the model parameters can be set so that when the
item x=y in a
m
[i] violates the constraints in G??, one of
the following is pushed onto A??: negate(), inform(x=z),
deny(x=y, x=z), etc.
2.6 Goal Update Model for System Acts
The goal update model P (G??|a
m
, G
?
) describes how the
user constraints C ? and requests R? change with a given
machine action a
m
. Assuming that R?? is conditionally
independent of C? given C ?? it can be shown that
P (G
??
|a
m
, G
?
)
= P (R
??
|a
m
, R
?
, C
??
)P (C
??
|a
m
, R
?
, C
?
). (12)
To restrict the space of transitions from R? to R?? it
can be assumed that the request slots are independent and
each slot (eg. addr,phone,etc.) is either filled using infor-
mation in a
m
or left unchanged. Using R[k] to denote the
k?th request slot, we approximate that the value of R??[k]
only depends on its value at the previous time step, the
value provided by a
m
, and M(a
m
, C
??
) which indicates
a match or mismatch between the information given in
a
m
and the goal constraints.
P (R
??
|a
m
, R
?
, C
??
)
=
?
k
P (R
??
[k]|a
m
, R
?
[k],M(a
m
, C
??
)). (13)
151
To simplify P (C ??|a
m
, R
?
, C
?
) we assume that C ?? is
derived from C ? by either adding a new constraint, set-
ting an existing constraint slot to a different value (eg.
drinks=dontcare), or by simply changing nothing. The
choice of transition does not need to be conditioned on
the full space of possible a
m
, R
? and C ?. Instead it can
be conditioned on simple boolean flags such as ?Does a
m
ask for a slot in the constraint set??, ?Does a
m
signal that
no item in the database matches the given constraints??,
etc. The model parameter set is then sufficiently small for
handcrafted values to be assigned to the probabilities.
3 Evaluation
3.1 Training the HIS Dialogue Manager
The Hidden Information State (HIS) model is the first
trainable and scalable implementation of a statistical
spoken dialog system based on the Partially-Observable
Markov Decision Process (POMDP) model of dialogue
(Young, 2006; Young et al, 2007; Williams and Young,
2007). POMDPs extend the standard Markov-Decision-
Process model by maintaining a belief space, i.e. a proba-
bility distribution over dialogue states, and hence provide
an explicit model of the uncertainty present in human-
machine communication.
The HIS model uses a grid-based discretisation of the
continuous state space and online -greedy policy iter-
ation. Fig. 2 shows a typical training run over 60,000
simulated dialogues, starting with a random policy. User
goals are randomly generated and an (arbitrary) reward
function assigning 20 points for successful completion
and -1 for every dialogue turn is used. As can be seen, di-
alogue performance (defined as the average reward over
1000 dialogues) converges after roughly 25,000 iterations
and asymptotes to a value of approx. 14 points.
Figure 2: Training a POMDP system
3.2 Experimental Evaluation and Results
A prototype HIS dialogue system with a learned policy
was built for the Tourist Information Domain and exten-
sively evaluated with 40 human subjects including native
and non-native speakers. A total of 160 dialogues with
21667 words was recorded and the average Word-Error-
Rate was 29.8%. Task scenarios involved finding a spe-
cific bar, hotel or restaurant in a fictitious town (eg. the
address of a cheap, Chinese restaurant in the west).
The performance of the system was measured based
on the recommendation of a correct venue, i.e. a venue
matching all constraints specified in the given task (all
tasks were designed to have a solution). Based on this
definition, 145 out of 160 dialogues (90.6%) were com-
pleted successfully, and the average number of turns to
completion was 5.59 (if no correct venue was offered the
full number of turns was counted).
4 Summary and Future Work
This paper has investigated a new agenda-based user sim-
ulation technique for bootstrapping a statistical dialogue
manager without access to training data. Evaluation re-
sults show that, even with manually set model parame-
ters, the simulator produces dialogue behaviour realistic
enough for training and testing a prototype system. While
the results demonstrate that the learned policy works well
for real users, it is not necessarily optimal. The next step
is hence to use the recorded data to train the simulator,
and to then retrain the DM policy.

Abstract
The Hidden Information State (HIS)
Dialogue System is the first trainable
and scalable implementation of a spoken
dialog system based on the Partially-
Observable Markov-Decision-Process
(POMDP) model of dialogue. The system
responds to n-best output from the speech
recogniser, maintains multiple concurrent
dialogue state hypotheses, and provides
a visual display showing how competing
hypotheses are ranked. The demo is
a prototype application for the Tourist
Information Domain and achieved a task
completion rate of over 90% in a recent
user study.
1 Partially Observable Markov Decision
Processes for Dialogue Systems
Recent work on statistical models for spoken di-
alogue systems has argued that Partially Observ-
able Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide
a principled mathematical framework for modeling
the uncertainty inherent in human-machine dialogue
(Williams, 2006; Young, 2006; Williams and Young,
2007). Briefly speaking, POMDPs extend the tra-
ditional fully-observable Markov Decision Process
(MDP) framework by maintaining a belief state, ie.
a probability distribution over dialogue states. This
enables the dialogue manager to avoid and recover
from recognition errors by sharing and shifting prob-
ability mass between multiple hypotheses of the cur-
rent dialogue state. The framework also naturally
incorporates n-best lists of multiple recognition hy-
potheses coming from the speech recogniser.
Due to the vast number of possible dialogue states
and policies, the use of POMDPs in practical dia-
logue systems is far from straightforward. The size
of the belief state scales linearly with the number of
dialogue states and belief state updates at every turn
during a dialogue require all state probabilities to be
recomputed. This is too computationally intensive
to be practical with current technology. Worse than
that, the complexity involved in policy optimisation
grows exponentially with the number of states and
system actions and neither exact nor approximate al-
gorithms exist that provide a tractable solution for
systems with thousands of states.
2 The Hidden Information State (HIS)
Dialogue Manager
The Hidden Information State (HIS) dialogue man-
ager presented in this demonstration is the first train-
able and scalable dialogue system based on the
POMDP model. As described in (Young, 2006;
Young et al, 2007) it partitions the state space using
a tree-based representation of user goals so that only
a small set of partition beliefs needs to be updated
at every turn. In order to make policy optimisation
tractable, a much reduced summary space is main-
tained in addition to the master state space. Policies
are optimised in summary space and the selected
summary actions are then mapped back to master
space to form system actions. Apart from some very
simple ontology definitions, the dialog manager has
no application dependent heuristics.
The system uses a grid-based discretisation of the
27
Figure 1: The HIS Demo System is a Tourist Infor-
mation application for a fictitious town
state space and online -greedy policy optimisation.
While this offers the potential for online adaptation
with real users at a later stage, a simulated user is
needed to bootstrap the training process. A novel
agenda-based simulation technique was used for this
step, as described in (Schatzmann et al, 2007).
3 The HIS Demo System
The HIS demo system is a prototype application for
the Tourist Information domain. Users are assumed
to be visiting a fictitious town called ?Jasonville?
(see Fig. 1) and need to find a suitable hotel, bar
or restaurant subject to certain constraints. Exam-
ples of task scenarios are ?finding a cheap Chinese
restaurant near the post office in the centre of town?
or ?a wine bar with Jazz music on the riverside?.
Once a venue is found, users may request further in-
formation such as the phone number or the address.
At run-time, the system provides a visual display
(see Fig. 2) which shows how competing dialogue
state hypotheses are being ranked. This allows de-
velopers to gain a better understanding of the inter-
nal operation of the system.
4 Demo System Performance
In a recent user study the demo system was evalu-
ated by 40 human subjects. In total, 160 dialogues
were recorded with an average Word-Error-Rate of
29.8%. The performance of the system was mea-
sured based on the recommendation of a correct
venue and achieved a task completion rate of 90.6%
with an average number of 5.59 dialogue turns to
completion (Thomson et al, 2007).
Figure 2: A system screenshot showing the ranking
of competing dialogue state hypotheses
The results demonstrate that POMDPs facilitate
design and implementation of spoken dialogue sys-
tems, and that the implementation used in the HIS
dialogue manager can be scaled to handle real world
tasks. The user study results also show that a
simulated user can be successfully used to train a
POMDP dialogue policy that performs well in ex-
periments with real users.
