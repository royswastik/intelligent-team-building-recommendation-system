Abstract  
This paper presents a study of the effects of 
syntax and melodic configuration on turn-
taking in Southern British English. Using 
dialogue materials, two perception 
experiments were carried out. In the first, 
subjects heard dialogue fragments in which 
syntactic completeness and melodic contour 
were systematically varied, and were asked 
whether they expected a subsequent turn 
exchange or not. In the second, subjects 
were presented with short speaker 
exchanges taken from the same material, 
and asked whether they thought the first 
speaker had intended to cede the turn or not. 
The results suggest that syntactic completion 
or non-completion is the main factor in 
predicting turn-taking behaviour. Only one 
melodic contour, the high level tone H* %, 
appears to operate as a turn holding device, 
regardless of whether the utterance is 
grammatically complete or not. The results 
of this study were found to be similar to 
those of a study of Dutch turn-taking.  
Introduction 
Most studies of the intonational cues to turn-
taking have been carried out qualitatively within 
the theoretical framework of Conversation 
Analysis (e.g. Wells & Macfarlane 1998, Selting 
1996). An exception to this is the study by Ford 
and Thompson (1996), who found that turn-
changes in American English mostly appear 
when melodic, syntactic and pragmatic 
completion coincide. Two recent studies of the 
melodic cues to turn-taking in Dutch (Caspers 
2000, 2001) motivate the present study, which 
uses comparable English data to replicate as far 
as possible the perception experiments carried 
out in Caspers (2001). On the basis of the 
findings for Dutch we expected syntactic 
completeness to be the overriding predictor of a 
possible turn change. Where melody has an 
effect, we hypothesised that, as in Dutch, the 
high level tone was likely to signal more to 
come and that no subsequent turn change would 
be expected (Caspers 1998). We also hoped to 
gain some insight into possible similarities and 
differences between the two languages.  
1 Materials 
The data used for these experiments was taken 
from Map Task data, recorded according to the 
Map Task conventions described in Anderson et 
al. (1991), and collected as part of the IViE 
project (Grabe et al in preparation). We chose 
dialogues recorded in Cambridge, as they 
represented most closely the standard southern 
variety of British English.  
2 Data Analysis  
Following the method used by Caspers (2001), 
two complete Map Tasks (approximately 30 
minutes of speech) were divided into inter-
pausal units (IPUs, cf. Koiso et al 1998) using a 
pause threshold of 100ms. Boundaries were then 
categorised according to three criteria. 
    Firstly, each IPU boundary was identified as 
either occurring within the turn of the same 
speaker, (category HOLD) or involving a change 
of speaker (category CHANGE). Secondly, the 
text before each IPU boundary was judged for 
syntactic completion. If the utterance was at 
least potentially complete at that point the 
boundary was categorised as syntactically 
complete, otherwise as ?not complete?. Finally, 
we selected a set of IPUs according to their final 
contour, identified in terms of the British system 
of ?nuclear tones? (fall, rise etc.) and in 
autosegmental-metrical terms of final pitch 
accent and subsequent boundary tone. 
(Following Gussenhoven et al (1999) we 
included the possibility of a boundary tone that 
was neither low nor high, transcribed as %.)  We 
identified IPUs ending in one of the following 
contours: a high rise (H* H%), a high level (H* 
%), a fall-rise (H*L H%), a fall (H*L L%) and a 
truncated fall (H*L %).  
3 Method 
In the first experiment, subjects were presented 
with a dialogue fragment ending at an IPU 
boundary. The subjects? task was to predict what 
happens next, i.e. whether the speaker holds the 
turn, or holds after a brief backchannel response, 
or cedes the turn. In the second experiment we 
again asked subjects to judge what the first 
speaker had intended - to continue or to cede the 
turn, but under slightly different conditions: this 
time subjects heard brief exchanges involving 
both speakers. This was to see if the presence of 
an actual response influenced subjects? 
judgement of the first speaker?s intention. The 
same subjects took part in both experiments. 
They were 25 native speakers of Southern 
British English, 9 men and 16 women, aged 
between 19 and 54, only 7 of whom had some 
background in linguistics. No hearing 
difficulties were reported.
 
4 Experiment One 
4.1 Stimulus material 
For the first experiment, the stimuli consisted of 
dialogue fragments, around 8 to 13 seconds in 
length, and ending in an IPU. The fragments 
were chosen such that they ended according to 
the following four conditions:  
(i) turn exchange plus syntactic completion 
(ii) turn exchange minus syntactic completion 
(iii) turn hold plus syntactic completion 
(iv) turn hold minus syntactic completion 
The five contours chosen were as listed in 
paragraph 2 above. For all but the high rise (H* 
H%) two stimuli were chosen for each of the 
above conditions, giving 32 stimuli. As syntactic 
completion could, of course, include 
interrogatives, which would be highly likely to 
project a turn change, these were avoided for all 
but one stimulus for the fall-rise contour and 
three for the high rise. We found very few cases 
of the high rise in the English data, an 
interesting finding in itself, and it was not 
possible to find examples for each condition; 
only six cases were used altogether, four 
syntactically complete (two interrogatives and 
two declaratives) and two syntactically 
incomplete.  
4.2 Procedure 
After three practice examples, the 38 
randomised stimuli were each presented twice. 
Subjects were asked to predict whether (1) the 
current speaker would continue, (2) the current 
speaker would continue after a short, non-
obligatory backchannel response, or (3) the 
second speaker would take over. 
 
4.3 Results 
The results for this experiment are given in 
Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 gives the frequency of 
responses per condition, and Table 2 shows 
whether the differences in number of turn-
keeping responses between the contour types are 
significant. Note that in the latter table we 
conflate the responses ?hold? and backchannel?, 
since, despite subtle pragmatic differences, we 
judged the prediction of a backchannel to entail 
the prediction of a turn continuation (cf. Koiso et 
al.). A hierarchical loglinear analysis performed 
on the factors response type, contour type and 
syntactic completion shows significant 
associations between response type and contour

=507.4, p<.0001). This 
means that there are main effects as well as 
interaction effects of contour type and 
grammatical completion on the responses. 
Table 1 shows that subjects virtually never 
expect a turn change when the fragment is 
syntactically incomplete (2%). The only 
significant differences in the number of expected 
turn-keepings (?backchannel? plus ?hold?) are 
found between contours H*L L% and H*L H% 
and between H*L L% and H*L %, but these 
effects are rather small (see Table 2). The main 
difference appears to be the degree to which 
contours invite a backchannel response. This

tendency is weak for both the fall (H*L L%) and 
the truncated fall (H*L %), but nearly half of the 
H*L H% contours in syntactically incomplete 
positions are judged to invite backchannel 
feedback.   
The syntactically complete utterances, on the 
other hand, show a clear effect of contour type: a 
rising pitch accent followed by a level boundary 
tone (H* %) leads to 89% expected ?hold? 
responses, supporting the hypothesis that this 
melodic configuration functions as a turn-
keeping device. In this respect it differs strongly 
from all other contours, as is evident from the 
data presented in Table 2.  
The results for the syntactically complete H* 
H% stimuli reflect the utterance type, and should 
therefore be treated with caution. Not 
surprisingly, the two interrogatives attracted 
almost exclusively the judgement 'change'; the  
remaining two declaratives attracted almost 
exclusively the judgement 'backchannel'. The 
use of a high rise on declaratives is a recent and 
highly marked innovation in British English, and 
is assumed to have the function of eliciting 
hearer acknowledgment. Our results are 
consistent with this view.  
 As Table 2 shows, there was an interesting 
and significant difference between the effect of 
the complete fall (H*L L%) and the truncated 
fall (H*L %). The truncated fall is much more 
likely to cue a turn hold (71% of responses 
compared with 41% for the complete fall) and 
correspondingly less likely to cue a turn change 
(29% compared with 59% for the complete fall).  
4.4 Discussion 
The results of this experiment suggest that, in 
this variety of English, incomplete syntax 
overrides any melodic cues. Only the high level 
tone appears to be a strong turn keeping device, 
regardless of syntax. On the other hand there 
appear to be no melodic contours which, when 
they occur in conjunction with syntactic 
completeness, can be said to predict a turn 
change. We thus find more evidence for the use 
of melody as a turn keeping device than as a turn 
ceding device. The second experiment was 
designed to investigate the degree to which such 
judgements of speaker intention were upheld in 
the presence of an actual speaker response. 
5 Experiment Two 
5.1 Stimulus material 
The stimuli for this part of the experiment were 
drawn from the same material as in Part A. Each 
fragment that ended in the original data in a turn 
exchange was extended to include the turn 
exchange itself. This produced a sound file of 
around 8 to 12 seconds in length. The turn 
exchange was then excised as a short separate 
file of around 3 to 5 seconds. Regardless of 
contour, a speaker change at a syntactically 
incomplete point was hard to find in our data, 
and a number of these stimuli were created 
artificially by editing out intervening material.  
5.2 Procedure 
The same subjects participated in both parts of 
the experiment. They were first presented with 
the longer fragment containing the relevant turn 
exchange, and then heard the file containing 
only the turn exchange twice in succession. The 
20 stimuli (4 for each contour) were preceded by 
three test stimuli. The subjects were asked to 
judge whether the first speaker had expected the 
turn exchange, had expected to continue, or 
whether it was unclear. 
5.3 Results 
Tables 3 and 4 contain the results for the second 
experiment. A hierarchical loglinear analysis 
performed on the factors response type, contour 
type and syntactic completion shows significant

his or her turn after a high level contour  (there 
are only 8% expected changes after H* %), and 
Table 4 shows large differences between this 
contour type and all others. In contrast with the 
first experiment, however, there is a clear 
influence of contour type on the responses in the 
minus syntactic completion condition: in almost 
a third of the cases subjects feel that the original 
speaker had expected the turn to change after a 
default pitch accent (H*L) followed by a low 
(L%) or high (H%) boundary tone, that is, after a 
complete fall or after a fall-rise, and Table 4 
shows that these two contour types differ 
significantly from all others (except from each 
other). The similarity between the complete fall 
and the fall-rise, which is also evident in the 
syntactic completion condition, suggests that 
both contours are perceived to have a similar 
function with respect to turn-taking and to be at 
least strong secondary cues to turn completion. 
In cases where there is a clear mismatch 
between syntax and contour (i.e. melodic 
completion but no syntactic completion) the 
actual presence of a speaker change makes 
subjects more likely to judge that this was the 
intention of the first speaker than they were in 
the first experiment, where they did not know 
what happened next.  
 Although subjects were simply asked to 
judge what they thought the first speaker had 
intended, their judgements were probably to 
some extent based on a post hoc analysis of the 
whole exchange. It is a general principle of 
pragmatics that utterances will be assumed to be 
relevant unless proved otherwise, and that 
conversational interaction will be assumed to be 
cooperative unless proved otherwise. There is 
therefore a strong likelihood that subjects 
subconsciously sought a cooperative explanation 
for actual turn changes wherever possible.  
6 General Discussion 
The major finding of this study, especially of the 
first part, is that if an isolated utterance is 
syntactically incomplete, listeners are highly 
unlikely to predict a turn change, whatever the 
melodic contour used. Where the syntax is 
complete, none of the contours lead listeners to 
predict exclusively a turn change. This means 
that both hold and change are possible at this 
point. There is one exception, namely where the 
accompanying contour is a high level tone (H* 
%). This contour in English appears to signal a 
clear turn hold, regardless of syntax. 
We were also able to make some cross-
linguistic comparisons. First, the similarities: it 
appears that in both Southern British English 
and Dutch the H* % contour signals the 
speaker?s intention to keep the turn. This effect 
cannot be attributed to the absence of a ?real? 
boundary tone, since the truncated fall, which 
also ends in a %, does not behave as a cue to 
turn-keeping.  
We also observed two main differences 
between the languages. The first concerns the 
occurrence of high rise tones (H* H%): we had 
difficulty in finding any of these in the English 
data but not in the Dutch, which may indicate a 
general difference in contour distribution, or a 
difference in contour function in the two 
languages. This is an interesting question to pose 
in a larger-scale, corpus-based study.  
The second difference relates to our 
observation that some contours are more likely 
than others to suggest a subsequent backchannel 
response. This has important implications for the 
study of cooperation in interaction, both within 
and between languages (cf. Wichmann 2000). 
The number of ?backchannel? judgements given 
as responses to the stimuli ending in a high level 
tone H* % differs between Dutch and English: 
Caspers (2001) reports that in the Dutch study 
56% of these contours suggest a backchannel 
response, compared to only 6% in the English 
study. This difference may have consequences 
for cross-cultural communication: if types of 
conversational behaviour are ?appropriate? in one 
language but not in the other there is potential 
for cross-cultural misunderstandings which may 
be perceived as ?attitudinal?. 
7       Conclusion 
The results of this study of English turn-taking 
support the Dutch findings of Caspers (2001), 
suggesting that while there are no melodic 
contours which reliably predict a turn change, 
the high level contour (H* %) creates the strong 
percept in both languages of a turn continuation, 
regardless of whether the utterance is 
syntactically complete or not. Other contours 
appear to operate at most as secondary cues to 
turn-taking, with syntactic completion or non-
completion having the stronger effect.  
A further observation - that some contours 
are more amenable to a backchannel response 
than others - suggests differences between the 
two languages which may have important cross-
cultural implications.  
While the answers to some of these questions 
may more suitably be sought using other 
methods, notably corpus-based analysis, we 
consider that such approaches are 
complementary to the perceptual evidence 
reported here.
