Abstract 
This presentation is primarily a demonstration 
of a working statistical machine translation 
system which translates Modern Standard 
Arabic into English.  
1 Overview 
Language Weaver has produced a high-
performance statistical Arabic-to-English machine 
translation system, based on research work 
conducted at the University of Southern California, 
Information Sciences Institute (USC/ISI).  Getting 
resource-unlimited laboratory systems to run in 
real time, on a typical desktop Windows machine, 
is among Language Weaver?s contributions.  The 
system is designed to provide broad general 
coverage of Arabic news, and is currently used at 
various sites within the U.S. Government.  
 
 
 
 
 
The Arabic->English translation system to be 
demonstrated has been prepared in versions that 
require 1 or 2 GB of RAM, and run on a 1.5GHz or 
faster processor and translates at a minimum rate 
of 500 words per minute.  The system includes an 
option to trade off speed for quality in the 
translation process allowing users to select the 
fastest possible gisting-quality output, or the best 
possible translation quality for each sentence. 
2 Demonstration 
The translation system will be demonstrated on 
current news, and possibly other postings from 
Internet, or other files:
