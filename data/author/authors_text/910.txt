Abstract
Sources of training data suitable for language
modeling of conversational speech are limited.
In this paper, we show how training data can be
supplemented with text from the web filtered to
match the style and/or topic of the target recog-
nition task, but also that it is possible to get big-
ger performance gains from the data by using
class-dependent interpolation of N-grams.
1 Introduction
Language models constitute one of the key components
in modern speech recognition systems. Training an N-
gram language model, the most commonly used type of
model, requires large quantities of text that is matched
to the target recognition task both in terms of style and
topic. In tasks involving conversational speech the ideal
training material, i.e. transcripts of conversational speech,
is costly to produce, which limits the amount of training
data currently available.
Methods have been developed for the purpose of lan-
guage model adaptation, i.e. the adaptation of an exist-
ing model to new topics, domains, or tasks for which
little or no training material may be available. Since
out-of-domain data can contain relevant as well as irrele-
vant information, various methods are used to identify the
most relevant portions of the out-of-domain data prior to
combination. Past work on pre-selection has been based
on word frequency counts (Rudnicky, 1995), probabil-
ity (or perplexity) of word or part-of-speech sequences
(Iyer and Ostendorf, 1999), latent semantic analysis (Bel-
legarda, 1998), and information retrieval techniques (Ma-
hajan et al, 1999; Iyer and Ostendorf, 1999). Perplexity-
based clustering has also been used for defining topic-
specific subsets of in-domain data (Clarkson and Robin-
son, 1997; Martin et al 1997), and test set perplexity
has been used to prune documents from a training corpus
(Klakow, 2000). The most common method for using the
additional text sources is to train separate language mod-
els on a small amount of in-domain and large amounts
of out-of-domain data and to combine them by interpola-
tion, also referred to as mixtures of language models. The
technique was reported by IBM in 1995 (Liu et al 1995),
and has been used by many sites since then. An alter-
native approach involves decomposition of the language
model into a class n-gram for interpolation (Iyer and Os-
tendorf, 1997; Ries, 1997), allowing content words to be
interpolated with different weights than filled pauses, for
example, which gives an improvement over standard mix-
ture modeling for conversational speech.
Recently researchers have turned to the World Wide
Web as an additional source of training data for language
modeling. For ?just-in-time? language modeling (Berger
and Miller, 1998), adaptation data is obtained by submit-
ting words from initial hypotheses of user utterances as
queries to a web search engine. Their queries, however,
treated words as individual tokens and ignored function
words. Such a search strategy typically generates text of
a non-conversational style, hence not ideally suited for
ASR. In (Zhu and Rosenfeld, 2001), instead of down-
loading the actual web pages, the authors retrieved N-
gram counts provided by the search engine. Such an ap-
proach generates valuable statistics but limits the set of
N-grams to ones occurring in the baseline model.
In this paper, we present an approach to extracting ad-
ditional training data from the web by searching for text
that is better matched to a conversational speaking style.
We also show how we can make better use of this new
data by applying class-dependent interpolation.
2 Collecting Text from the Web
The amount of text available on the web is enormous
(over 3 billion web pages are indexed via Google alone)
and continues to grow. Most of the text on the web is
non-conversational, but there is a fair amount of chat-like
material that is similar to conversational speech though
often omitting disfluencies. This was our primary target
when extracting data from the web. Queries submitted to
Google were composed of N-grams that occur most fre-
quently in the switchboard training corpus, e.g. ?I never
thought I would?, ?I would think so?, etc. We were
searching for the exact match to one or more of these
N-grams within the text of the web pages. Web pages
returned by Google for the most part consisted of conver-
sational style phrases like ?we were friends but we don?t
actually have a relationship? and ?well I actually I I really
haven?t seen her for years.?
We used a slightly different search strategy when col-
lecting topic-specific data. First we extended the base-
line vocabulary with words from a small in-domain train-
ing corpus (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2002), and then we
used N-grams with these new words in our web queries,
e.g. ?wireless mikes like?, ?I know that recognizer? for
a meeting transcription task (Morgan et al 2001). Web
pages returned by Google mostly contained technical ma-
terial related to topics similar to what was discussed in the
meetings, e.g. ?we were inspired by the weighted count
scheme...?, ?for our experiments we used the Bellman-
Ford algorithm...?, etc.
The retrieved web pages were filtered before their con-
tent could be used for language modeling. First we
stripped the HTML tags and ignored any pages with a
very high OOV rate. We then piped the text through
a maximum entropy sentence boundary detector (Rat-
naparkhi, 1996) and performed text normalization using
NSW tools (Sproat et al 2001).
3 Class-dependent Mixture of LMs
Linear interpolation is a standard approach to combin-
ing language models, where the probability of a word
wi given history h is computed as a linear combination
of the corresponding N-gram probabilities from S dif-
ferent models: p(wi|h) =
?
s?S ?sps(wi|h). Depend-
ing on how much adaptation data is available it may be
beneficial to estimate a larger number of mixture weights
?s (more than one per data source) in order to handle
source mismatch, specifically letting the mixture weight
depend on the context h. One approach is to use a mixture
weight corresponding to the source posterior probability
?s(h) = p(s|h) (Weintraub et al 1996). Here, we instead
choose to let the weight vary as a function of the previous
word class, i.e. p(wi|h) =
?
s?S ?s(c(wi?1))ps(wi|h),
where classes c(wi?1) are part-of-speech tags except for
the 100 most frequent words which form their own indi-
vidual classes. Such a scheme can generalize across do-
mains by tapping into the syntactic structure (POS tags),
already shown to be useful for cross-domain language
modeling (Iyer and Ostendorf, 1997), and at the same
time target conversational speech since the top 100 words
cover 70% of tokens in Switchboard training corpus.
Combining several N-grams can produce a model with
a very large number of parameters, which is costly in de-
coding. In such cases N-grams are typically pruned. Here
we use entropy-based pruning (Stolcke, 1998) after mix-
ing unpruned models, and reduce the model aggressively
to about 15% of its original size. The same pruning pa-
rameters were applied to all models in our experiments.
4 Experiments
We evaluated on two tasks: 1) Switchboard (Godfrey et
al., 1992), specifically the HUB5 eval 2001 set having a
total of 60K words spoken by 120 speakers, and 2) an
ICSI Meeting recorder (Morgan et al 2001) eval set hav-
ing a total of 44K words spoken by 25 speakers. Both
sets featured spontaneous conversational speech. There
were 45K words of held-out data for each task.
Text corpora of conversational telephone speech
(CTS) available for training language models consisted
of Switchboard, Callhome English, and Switchboard-
cellular, a total of 3 million words. In addition to that we
used 150 million words of Broadcast News (BN) tran-
scripts, and we collected 191 million words of ?con-
versational? text from the web. For the Meetings task,
there were 200K words of meeting transcripts available
for training, and we collected 28 million words of ?topic-
related? text from the web.
The experiments were conducted using the SRI large
vocabulary speech recognizer (Stolcke et al 2000) in
the N-best rescoring mode. A baseline bigram language
model was used to generate N-best lists, which were then
rescored with various trigram models.
Table 1 shows word error rates (WER) on the HUB5
test set, comparing performance of the class-based mix-
ture against standard (i.e. class-independent) interpola-
tion. The class-based mixture gave better results in all
cases except when only CTS sources were used, probably
because these sources are similar to each other and the
class-based mixture is mainly useful when data sources
are more diverse. We also obtained lower WER by using
the web data instead of BN, which indicates that the web
data is better matched to our task (i.e. it is more ?conver-
sational?). If training data is completely arbitrary, then its
benefits to the recognition task are minimal, as shown by
an example of using a 66M-word corpus collected from
random web pages. The baseline Switchboard model
gave test set perplexity of 96, which is reduced to 87 with
a standard mixture CTS and BN data, reduced further to
83 by adding the web data, and to a best case of 82 with
class-dependent interpolation and the added web data.
Increasing the amount of web training data from 61M
to 191M gave relatively small performance gains. We
?trimmed? the 191M-word web corpus down to 61M
words by choosing documents with lowest perplexity
according to the combined CTS model, yielding the
?Web2? data source. The model that used Web2 gave
the same WER as the one trained with the original 61M
web corpus. It could be that the web text obtained
with ?Google? filtering is fairly homogeneous, so little
is gained by further perplexity filtering. Or, it could be
that when choosing better matched data, we also exclude
new N-grams that may occur only in testing.

and class-based mixtures.

Results on the Meeting test set are shown in Table
2, where the baseline model was trained on CTS and
BN sources. As in the HUB5 experiments, the class-
based mixture outperformed standard interpolation. We
achieved lower WER by using the web data instead of
the meeting transcripts, but the best results are obtained
by using all data sources. Language model perplexity is
reduced from 122 for the baseline to a best case of 95.
We also tried different class assignments for the class-
based mixture on the HUB5 set and we found that using
automatically derived classes instead of part-of-speech
tags does not lead to performance degradation as long
as we allocate individual classes for the top 100 words.
Automatic class mapping can make class-based mixtures
feasible for other languages where part-of-speech tags are
difficult to derive.
5 Conclusions
In summary, we have shown that, if filtered, web text
can be successfully used for training language models
of conversational speech, outperforming some other out-
of-domain (BN) and small domain-specific (Meetings)
sources of data. We have also found that by combin-
ing LMs from different domains with class-dependent in-
terpolation (particularly when each of the top 100 words
forms its own class), we achieve lower WER than if we
use the standard approach where mixture weights depend
only on the data source. Recognition experiments show a
significant reduction in WER (1.3-2.3% absolute) due to
additional training data and class-based interpolation.
