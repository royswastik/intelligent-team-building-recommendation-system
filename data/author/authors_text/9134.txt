Abstract 
This paper describes a Web-based Eng-
lish-Chinese concordance system, Total-
Recall, developed to promote translation 
reuse and encourage authentic and idio-
matic use in second language writing. We 
exploited and structured existing high-
quality translations from the bilingual Si-
norama Magazine to build the concor-
dance of authentic text and translation. 
Novel approaches were taken to provide 
high-precision bilingual alignment on the 
sentence, phrase and word levels. A 
browser-based user interface (UI) is also 
developed for ease of access over the 
Internet. Users can search for word, 
phrase or expression in English or Chi-
nese. The Web-based user interface facili-
tates the recording of the user actions to 
provide data for further research. 
1 Introduction 
A concordance tool is particularly useful for study-
ing a piece of literature when thinking in terms of a 
particular word, phrase or theme. It will show ex-
actly how often and where a word occurs, so can 
be helpful in building up some idea of how differ-
ent themes recur within an article or a collection of 
articles. Concordances have been indispensable for 
lexicographers and increasingly considered useful 
for language instructor and learners. A bilingual 
concordance tool is like a monolingual concor-
dance, except that each sentence is followed by its 
translation counterpart in a second language. It 
could be extremely useful for bilingual lexicogra-
phers, human translators and second language 
learners. Pierre Isabelle, in 1993, pointed out: ?ex-
isting translations contain more solutions to more 
translation problems than any other existing re-
source.? It is particularly useful and convenient 
when the resource of existing translations is made 
available on the Internet. A web based bilingual 
system has proved to be very useful and popular. 
For example, the English-French concordance sys-
tem, TransSearch (Macklovitch et al 2000). Pro-
vides a familiar interface for the users who only 
need to type in the expression in question, a list of 
citations will come up and it is easy to scroll down 
until one finds one that is useful. TotalRecall 
comes with an additional feature making the solu-
tion more easily recognized. The user not only get 
all the citations related to the expression in ques-
tion, but also gets to see the translation counterpart 
highlighted. 
 
TotalRecall extends the translation memory 
technology and provide an interactive tool intended 
for translators and non-native speakers trying to 
find ideas to properly express themselves. Total-
Recall empower the user by allow her to take the 
initiative in submitting queries for searching au-
thentic, contemporary use of English. These que-
ries may be single words, phrases, expressions or 
even full sentence, the system will search a sub-
stantial and relevant corpus and return bilingual 
citations that are helpful to human translators and 
second language learners. 
2 Aligning the corpus 
Central to TotalRecall is a bilingual corpus and a 
set of programs that provide the bilingual analyses 
to yield a translation memory database out of the 
bilingual corpus. Currently, we are working with a 
collection of Chinese-English articles from the Si-
norama magazine. A large bilingual collection of 
Studio Classroom English lessons will be provided 
in the near future.  That would allow us to offer 
bilingual texts in both translation directions and 
with different levels of difficulty. Currently, the 
articles from Sinaroma seems to be quite usefully 
by its own, covering a wide range of topics, re-
flecting the personalities, places, and events in 
Taiwan for the past three decade.  
 
The concordance database is composed of bi-
lingual sentence pairs, which are mutual transla-
tion. In addition, there are also tables to record 
additional information, including the source of 
each sentence pairs, metadata, and the information 
on phrase and word level alignment. With that ad-
ditional information, TotalRecall provides various 
functions, including 1. viewing of the full text of 
the source with a simple click. 2. highlighted 
translation counterpart of the query word or phrase. 
3. ranking that is pedagogically useful for transla-
tion and language learning. 
 
We are currently running an experimental pro-
totype with Sinorama articles, dated mainly from 
1995 to 2002. There are approximately 50,000 bi-
lingual sentences and over 2 million words in total. 
We also plan to continuously updating the database 
with newer information from Sinorama magazine 
so that the concordance is kept current and relevant 
to the . To make these up to date and relevant.  
 
The bilingual texts that go into TotalRecall 
must be rearranged and structured. We describe the 
main steps below: 
2.1 Sentence Alignment 
After parsing each article from files and put them 
into the database, we need to segment articles into 
sentences and align them into pairs of mutual 
translation. While the length-based approach 
(Church and Gale 1991) to sentence alignment 
produces surprisingly good results for the close 
language pair of French and English at success 
rates well over 96%, it does not fair as well for 
distant language pairs such as English and Chinese. 
Work on sentence alignment of English and Chi-
nese texts (Wu 1994), indicates that the lengths of 
English and Chinese texts are not as highly corre-
lated as in French-English task, leading to lower 
success rate (85-94%) for length-based aligners.  
 
Table 1  The result of Chinese collocation candi-
dates extracted. The shaded collocation pairs are 
selected based on competition of whole phrase log 
likelihood ratio and word-based translation prob-
ability. Un-shaded items 7 and 8 are not selected 
because of conflict with previously chosen bilin-
gual collocations, items 2 and 3. 
 
Simard, Foster, and Isabelle (1992) pointed out 
cognates in two close languages such as English 
and French can be used to measure the likelihood 
of mutual translation. However, for the English-
Chinese pair, there  are no  orthographic,  phonetic 
or semantic cognates readily recognizable by the 
computer. Therefore, the cognate-based approach 
is not applicable to the Chinese-English tasks.  
 
At first, we used the length-based method for 
sentence alignment. The average precision of 
aligned sentence pairs is about 95%. We are now 
switching to a new alignment method based on 
punctuation statistics. Although the average ratio 
of the punctuation counts in a text is low (less than 
15%), punctuations provide valid additional evi-
dence, helping to achieve high degree of alignment 
precision. It turns out that punctuations are telling 
evidences for sentence alignment, if we do more 
than hard matching of punctuations and take into 
consideration of intrinsic sequencing of punctua-
tion in ordered comparison. Experiment results 
show that the punctuation-based approach outper-
forms the length-based approach with precision 
rates approaching 98%.  
2.2 Phrase and Word Alignment 
After sentences and their translation counterparts 
are identified, we proceeded to carry out finer-
grained alignment on the phrase and word levels. 
We employ  part of speech patterns  and  statistical

analyses to extract bilingual phrases/collocations 
from a parallel corpus. The preferred syntactic pat-
terns are obtained from idioms and collocations in 
the machine readable English-Chinese version of 
Longman Dictionary of Contemporary of English. 
 
Phrases matching the patterns are extract from 
aligned sentences in a parallel corpus. Those 
phrases are subsequently matched up via cross lin-
guistic statistical association. Statistical association 
between the whole phrase as well as words in 
phrases are used jointly to link a collocation and its 
counterpart collocation in the other language. See 
Table 1 for an example of extracting bilingual col-
locations. The word and phrase level information is 
kept in relational database for use in processing 
queries, hightlighting translation counterparts, and 
ranking citations. Sections 3 and 4 will give more 
details about that. 
3 The Queries 
The goal of the TotalRecall System is to allow a 
user to look for instances of specific words or ex-
pressions. For this purpose, the system opens up 
two text boxes for the user to enter queries in any 
one of the languages involved or both. We offer 
some special expressions for users to specify the 
following queries: 
 
? Exact single word query - W. For instance, 
enter ?work? to find citations that contain 
?work,? but not ?worked?, ?working?, 
?works.? 
? Exact single lemma query ? W+. For in-
stance, enter ?work+? to find citations that 
contain ?work?, ?worked?, ?working?, 
?works.? 
? Exact string query. For instance, enter ?in 
the work? to find citations that contain the 
three words, ?in,? ?the,? ?work? in a row, 
but not citations that contain the three words 
in any other way. 
? Conjunctive and disjunctive query. For in-
stance, enter ?give+ advice+? to find cita-
tions that contain ?give? and ?advice.? It is 
also possible to specify the distance between 
?give? and ?advice,? so they are from a VO 
construction. Similarly, enter ?hard | diffi-
cult | tough? to find citations that involve 
difficulty to do, understand or bear some-
thing, using any of the three words. 
Once a query is submitted, TotalRecall dis-
plays the results on Web pages. Each result ap-
pears as a pair of segments, usually one sentence 
each in English and Chinese, in side-by-side for-
mat. The words matching the query are high-
lighted, and a ?context? hypertext link is included 
in each row. If this link is selected, a new page ap-
pears displaying the original document of the pair. 
If the user so wishes, she can scroll through the 
following or preceding pages of context in the 
original document. 
4 Ranking 
It is well known that the typical user usual has no 
patient to go beyond the first or second pages re-
turned by a search engine. Therefore, ranking and 
putting the most useful information in the first one 
or two is of paramount importance for search en-
gines. This is also true for a concordance.  
 
Experiments with a focus group indicate that 
the following ranking strategies are important: 
 
? Citations with a translation counterpart 
should be ranked first. 
? Citations with a frequent translation coun-
terpart appear before ones with less frequent 
translation 
? Citations with same translation counterpart 
should be shown in clusters by default. The 
cluster can be called out entirely on demand. 
? Ranking by nonlinguistic features should 
also be provided, including date, sentence 
length, query position in citations, etc. 
 
With various ranking options available, the users 
can choose one that is most convenient and 
productive for the work at hand. 
5 Conclusion 
In this paper, we describe a bilingual concordance 
designed as a computer assisted translation and 
language learning tool. Currently, TotalRecall 
uses Sinorama Magazine corpus as the translation 
memory and will be continuously updated as new 
issues of the magazine becomes available. We 
have already put a beta version on line and ex-
perimented with a focus group of second language 
learners. Novel features of TotalRecall include 
highlighting of query and corresponding transla-
tions, clustering and ranking of search results ac-
cording translation and frequency. 
 
TotalRecall enable the non-native speaker who 
is looking for a way to express an idea in English 
or Chinese. We are also adding on the basic func-
tions to include a log of user activities, which will 
record the users? query behavior and their back-
ground. We could then analyze the data and find 
useful information for future research.
