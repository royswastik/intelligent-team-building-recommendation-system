Abstract 
This paper describes a domain-independent, 
machine-learning based approach to tempo-
rally anchoring and ordering events in news. 
The approach achieves 84.6% accuracy in 
temporally anchoring events and 75.4% accu-
racy in partially ordering them.

Introduction 
Practical NLP applications such as text summariza-
tion and question-answering place increasing demands 
on the processing of temporal information. In multi-
document summarization of news, it is important to 
know the relative order of events so as to correctly 
merge and present information. In question-answering, 
one would like to be able to ask when an event occurs, 
or what events occurred prior to a particular event. Such 
capabilities presuppose an ability to infer the temporal 
order of events in discourse.  
A number of different knowledge sources appear to 
be involved in inferring event ordering (Lascarides and 
Asher 1993), including tense and aspect (1), temporal 
adverbials (2), and world knowledge (3).  
(1) Max entered the room. He had drunk/was drink-
ing the wine. 
(2) A drunken man died in the central Phillipines 
when he put a firecracker under his armpit. 
(3) U. N. Secretary- General Boutros Boutros-Ghali 
Sunday opened a meeting of ....Boutros-Ghali ar-
rived in Nairobi from South Africa, ? 
As (Bell 1999) has pointed out, the temporal struc-
ture of news is dictated by perceived news value rather 
than chronology. Thus, the latest news is often pre-
sented first, instead of events being described in order of 
occurrence (the latter ordering is called the narrative 
convention).  
This paper describes a domain-independent ap-
proach to temporally anchoring and ordering events in 
news. The approach is motivated by a pilot experiment 
with 8 subjects providing news event-ordering judg-
ments which revealed that the narrative convention ap-
plied only 47% of the time in ordering the events in 
successive past-tense clauses. Our approach involves 
mixed-initiative corpus annotation, with automatic tag-
ging to identify clause structure, tense, aspect, and tem-
poral adverbials, as well as tagging of reference times 
and anchoring of events with respect to reference times.  
We report on machine learning results from event-time 
anchoring  judgments. 
Linguistic Processing 
The time expression tagger TempEx (Mani and Wil-
son 2000) tags and assigns values to temporal expres-
sions, both ?absolute? expressions like ?June 1, 2001? 
and relative expressions like ?Monday?. It was cited in 
(Mani and Wilson 2000) as achieving a .83 F-measure 
against hand-annotated data. Inter-annotator reliability 
across 5 annotators on 193 TDT2-documents was .79F 
for extent and .86F for time values, with  TempEx scor-
ing .76F (extent) and .82F (value) on these documents. 
The clause tagger (CLAUSE-IT) identifies top-level 
clauses (C), top-level clauses with gapped subjects 
(GC), e.g., ?<C>He returned the book</C> <GC>and 
went home</GC>?, relative clauses (RC), and comple-
ment clauses (CO), which include all non-finite clauses.  
Our pilot experiment also revealed that the propor-
tion of clauses with explicit time expressions (TIMEX2) 
is approximately 25%, suggesting that anchoring the 
events to just the explicit times wouldn?t be sufficient. 
The system accordingly computes a reference time 
(Reichenbach 1947) value (tval)  for each clause, de-
fined to be either the time value of an explicit temporal 
expression mentioned in the clause, or, when the ex-
plicit time expression is absent, an implicit time value 
inferred from context.  
To generate this tval   feature, the simple algorithm 
in Figure 1 was used. The system also anchors the 
event?s time with respect to the tval (at, before, or after) 
when the tval is an explicit reference time. This feature 
is called anchor-explicit. All in all, the features shown 
in Table 1 were computed for each clause. 
 
Set initial tval to document-creation-date. 
For each clause: 
1. If clause has explicit time, then set its tval to it. 
2. If clause-type is relative clause, assume its tval 
is inaccessible to later discourse. 
3. If clause verb is of type reporting verb, set tval 
to document-creation-date. 
4. If clause is inside quotes inherit tval from em-
bedding clause. 
5. Otherwise, pick most recent tval.

Learning Anchoring Rules 
A human unconnected with our project corrected the 
tval, based on a set of annotation guidelines, on a sam-
ple of 2069 clauses extracted at random from the North 
American News Corpus. She also anchored the event?s 
time with respect to the tval (AT, BEF, AFT, or unde-
fined). This feature (not a machine feature) is called 
anchors.  
The corrections showed that the algorithm in Figure 
1 was right on tval for 1231 out of 2069, giving an accu-
racy of 59%.  Tracking the sequence of corrected tvals 
revealed that the tval of the previous clause was kept 
65.75% of the time, that it reverted to some other previ-
ous tval 22.99% of the time, and that it shifted to a new 
tval 11.26% of the times. Most of the errors in com-
puted tvals had to do with the tval being assigned erro-
neously the document date rather than reverting to a 
non-immediately previous tval. Finally, the anchor-
explicit relation is correct 83.8% of the time; however, 
just guessing ?at? for the explicit anchor will get an 
accuracy of 90.2%.

C5.0 Rules 80.2 (?1.8) 71.8 (?0.5) 
 
Table 2: Accuracy of Anchoring Rules 
 
We then used this training data to train a statistical 
classifier, C5.0 Rules (Quinlan 1997), to learn (1) an-
chors relation rules and (2) rules for tracking the tval 
moves (keep, revert, shift) across successive clauses. 
The accuracy of anchors rules as well as tval change 
rules are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that accuracy 
of machine learning here is significantly better than the 
majority class. The tval, tense, and tense shift play a 
useful role in anchoring, revealing that the tval is a use-
ful abstraction. Here are some of the rules learnt (here te 
is the clause index, assumed to stand for the event time 
of the clause): 
If no sconj and no tmod and no tprep and tval-class 
=day then anchors(AT, te,, tval) 80.4% accurate 
(156 examples). 
If tense is present and no sconj and tval-
class=month then anchors(AT, te,, tval) 77.8 (7). 
If  tense is present perfect and no sconj, then  
                                                                                           
See  www.umiacs.umd.edu/ ~bonnie/ LCS_ Data-
base_Documentation.html. 
2 Since the TIMEX2 and tval values form an open class, they 
were automatically grouped into classes based on the granular-
ity of the time expression, namely, {time-of-day, day, week, 
month, year, or non-specific}. 
anchors(BEF, te,, tval) 83 (4). 
If tense shift is present2past and no explicit time and 
no sconj, then anchors(AT, te,, tval) 90 (30) 
4 Partially Ordering Links 
Based on the best machine-learned rules for the 
anchors relation, anchors tuples are generated for each 
document. The tvals in the document?s anchor tuples are 
also partially ordered, yielding tuples consisting of or-
dered pairs of tvals. The two sets of tuples are then used 
to provide a partial ordering of events in the document, 
in the form of links tuples: links(R, ei, ej), where ei and 
ej are the events corresponding to clauses i and j, and R 
is in {at, bef, aft, or undefined}. One of the authors 
evaluated the partial ordering for accuracy, on seven 
documents3. The results of this evaluation are shown in 
Table 3. #Correct-anchor is the number of the anchors 
tuples correctly classified and #total is the total number 
of anchors tuples classified. Link Recall is the percent-
age of human generated links tuples (723 in all) that are 
correctly identified by machine learned rules. Link Pre-
cision is the percentage of the machine generated links 
tuples that are correct.

Conclusion 
3 Note that the na?ve algorithm for tval is only 59% correct. 
While improvements to the na?ve algorithm are clearly possi-
ble based on the corrected tval, to adequately test the machine 
learnt rules we use the corrected tval. 
Overall, our approach achieves 84.6% accuracy in 
anchoring events and 75.4% F-measure in partially or-
dering them. These numbers compare favorably with the 
previous literature: (Filatova and Hovy 2001) obtained 
82% accuracy on anchoring for a single type of 
event/topic on 172 clauses, while (Mani and Wilson 
2000) obtained accuracy of 59.4% on anchoring over 
663 verb contexts. Our approach is also distinct in its 
use of human experimentation, machine learning and 
the variety of linguistically motivated features (includ-
ing temporal adverbials) that are brought to bear.  
Future work will examine the role of aspectual fea-
tures, learning from skewed distributions dominated by 
AT (an overwhelming majority of news events occur at 
the reference times), and the incorporation of unsuper-
vised learning methods.
