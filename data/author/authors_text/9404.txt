Abstract 
This paper describes the Question Answering Sys- 
tem constructed uring a one semester graduate- 
level course on Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
We hypothesized that by using a combination ofsyn- 
tactic and semantic features and machine learning 
techniques, we could improve the accuracy of ques- 
tion answering on the test set of the Remedia corpus 
over the reported levels. The approach, although 
novel, was not entirely successful in the time frame 
of the course. 
1 Introduction 
This paper describes a preliminary reading com- 
prehension system constructed as a semester-long 
project for a natural language processing course. 
This was the first exposure to this material for 
all but one student, and so much of the semester 
was spent learning about and constructing the tools 
that would be needed to attack this comprehen- 
sive problem. The course was structured around 
the project of building a question answering system 
following the HumSent evaluation as used by the 
Deep Read system (Hirschman eta\]., 1999). The 
Deep Read reading comprehension prototype system 
(Hirschman et al, 1999) achieves a level of 36% of 
the answers correct using a bag-of-words approach 
together with limited linguistic processing. Since the 
average number of sentences per passage is 19.41, 
this performance is much better than chance (i.e., 
5%). We hypothesized that by using a combina- 
tion of syntactic and semantic features and machine 
learning techniques, we could improve the accuracy 
of question answering on the test set of the Remedia 
corpus over these reported levels.

(POS) tagger distributed with the Deep Read sys- 
tem. This tagged text is then passed to the Name 
Identification Module, which updates the tags of 
named entities with semantic information and gen- 
der when appropriate." The Partial Parser Mod- 
ule then takes this updated text and breaks it into 
phrases while attempting to \]exically disambiguate 
the text. The Pronoun Resolution Module is con- 
sulted by the parser in order to resolve pronouns be- 
fore passing partially parsed sentences and questions 
to the Sentence-to-Question Comparison Module. 
The Comparison Module determines how strongly 
the phrases of a sentence are related to those of a 
question, and this information is passed to several 
28 
modules which attempt to learn which features of 
the comparison are the most important for identify- 
ing whether a sentence is a strong answer candidate. 
We intended to set up a voting scheme among vari- 
ous modules; however, this part of the work has not 
been completed (as indicated by the dashed lines). 
Our system, like Deep Read, uses as the develop- 
ment set 28 stories from grade 2 and 27 from grade 
5, each with five short answer questions (who, what, 
when, where, and why), and 60 stories with ques- 
tions from grades 3 and 4 for testing 1. We will refer 
to the development and testing data as the Remedia 
corpus. The following example shows the informa- 
tion added to a plain text sentence as it progresses 
through each module of the system we have created. 
Each module-is described in more detail in the fol- 
lowing sections. 
2.1 Name Ident i f i ca t ion  Modu le  
The Name Identification Module expects as in- 
put a file that has been tagged by the Brill 
tagger distributed with the Deep Read system. 
The most important named entities in the Re- 
media corpus are the names of people and the 
names of places. To distinguish between these 
two types, we created dictionaries for names of 
people and names of places. The first and last 
name dictionaries were derived from the files 
at http ://www. census, gov/genealogy/names/. 
First names had an associated gender feature; 
names that were either male or female included 
gender frequency. Place names were extracted from 
atlases and other references, and included names 
of countries, major cities and capital cities, major 
attractions and parks, continents, etc. WordNet 
was also consulted because of its coverage of place 
names. There are 5,165 first name entries, 88,798 
last name entries, and 1,086 place name entries in 
the dictionaries used by this module. 
The module looks up possible names to decide 
whether a word is a person's name or a location. If it 
cannot find the word in the dictionaries, it then looks 
at the POS tags provided in the input file to deter- 
mine whether or not it is a propernoun. Heuristics 
(e.g., looking at titles like Mr. or word endings like 
rifle) are then applied to decide the semantic type 
of the propernoun, and if the type cannot be deter- 
mined, the module returns both person and location 
as its type. The accuracy of the Name Identification 
Module on the testing set was 79.6%. The accuracy 
adjusted to take into account incorrect tagging was 
83.6%. 
There were differences between the Deep Read electronic 
version of the passages and the Remedia  published passages. 
We used the electronic passages.

2.2 Par t ia l  Parser  Modu le  
The Partial Parser Module follows sequentially af- 
ter the Name Identification Module. The input is 
the set of story sentences and questions, such that 
the words in each are tagged with POS tags and 
the names are marked with type and gender infor- 
mation. Initially pronouns have not been resolved; 
the partial parser provides segmented text with rich 
lexical information and role labels directly to the 
Pronoun Resolution Modffle. After pronoun reso- 
lution, the segmented text with resolved pronouns 
is returned to the partial parser for the parser to 
update the feature values corresponding to the pro- 
nouns. Finally, the partial parser provides bracketed 
text to the Comparison Module, which extracts fea- 
tures that will be used to construct modules for an- 
swering questions. 
The Partial Parser Module utilizes information 
in a lexicon and a grammar to provide the partial 
parses. The lexicon and the parser will be detailed 
in the next two subsections. 
2.2.1 The  Lex icon 
There were two methods we used to construct he 
lexicon: open lexicon, which includes all words 
from the development set alng with all determiners, 
pronouns, prepositions, particles, and conjunctions 
(these words are essential to achieving ood sentence 
segmentation), and closed lexicon,  which includes 
all of the development and testing words 2. We con- 
structed the closed lexicon with the benefit of the 
development corpus only (i.e., we did not consult the 
test materials to design the entries). To improve cov- 
erage in the case of the open lexicon, we constructed 
a module for obtaining features fbr words that do 
not appear in the development set (unknown words) 
that interfaces with WordNet to determine a word's 
base/stem, semantic type, and synonyms. When an 
unknown word has multiple senses, we have opted to 
choose the first sense because WordNet orders senses 
by frequency of use. Ignoring numbers, there are 
1,999 unique words in the development set of the 
Remedia corpus, and 2,067 in the testing data, of 
which 1,008 do not appear in the development set. 
Overall, there are 3,007 unique words across both 
training and testing. 
One of our hypotheses was that by creating a lex- 
icon with a rich set of features, we would improve 
the accuracy of question answering. The entries in 
the lexicon were constructed using the conventions 
adopted for the Parsec parser (Harper and Helzer- 
man, 1995; Harper et al, 1995; Harper et al, 2000). 
Each word entry contains information about its root 
word (if there is one), its lexical category (or cate- 
gories) along with a corresponding set of allowable 
features and their corresponding values. Lexical cat- 
egories include noun, verb, pronoun, propernoun, 
adjective, adverb, preposition, particle, conjunction, 
determiner, cardinal, ordinal, predeterminer, noun 
modifier, and month. Feature types used in the 
lexicon include subcat,  gender, agr, case, vtype 
(e.g., progressive), mood, gap, inver ted ,  voice,  
behav ior  (e.g., mass), type (e.g., interrogative, rel- 
ative), semtype, and con j type  (e.g., noun-type, 
verb-type, etc.). We hypothesized that semtype 
should play a significant role in improving question 
answering performance, but the choice of semantic 
granularity is a difficult problem. We chose to keep 
the number of semantic values relatively small. By 
using the lexicographers' files in WordNet to group 
the semantic values, we selected 25 possible seman- 
tic values for the nouns and 15 for the verbs. A 
2Initially, we created the closed lexicon because this list 
of words was in the Deep Read materials. Once we spotted 
that the list contained words not in the development material, 
we kept it as an alternative to see how important full lexical 
knowledge would be for answering questions. 
30 
script was created to semi-automate he construc- 
tion of the lexicon from information extracted from 
previously existing dictionaries and from WordNet. 
2.2.2 The  Par t ia l  Parser  
The parser segments each sentence into either a noun 
phrase (NP), a verb phrase (VP), or a prepositional 
phrase (PP), each with various feature sets. NPs 
have the feature types: Base (the root word of the 
head word of the NP), AGR (number/person i for- 
mation), SemType (the semtype of the root form in 
the lexicon, e.g., person, object, event, artifact, or- 
ganization), Label (the role type of the word in the 
sentence, e.g., subject), and Gender. Verb phrases 
(VPs) have the feature types: Base, AGR, SemType 
(the semtype of the root form in the lexicon, e.g., 
contact, act, possession), Tense (e.g., present, past), 
and Voice. Prepositional phrases (PPs) have the 
feature types: Prep (the root form of the preposition 
word), SemType (the semtype of the root form in the 
lexicon, e.g., at-loc, at-time), Need (the object of the 
preposition), and NeedSemType (the semtype of the 
object of the preposition). Feature values are as- 
signed using the lexicon, Pronoun Resolution Mod- 
ule, and grammar ules. 
We implemented a bottom-up partial parser to 
segment each sentence into syntactic subparts. The 
grammar used in the bottom-up arser is shown be- 
low: 
1. NP -+ DET ADJ+ NOUN+ 
2. NP ~ DET NOUN 
3. NP ~ ADJ PROPERNOUN+ 
4. VP ~ (AUX-VERB) MAIN-VERB 
5. PP --~ ADV 
6. PP ~ ADJ (PRED) 
7. PP ~ PREP NP 
At the outset, the parser checks whether there are 
any punctuation marks in the sentence, with corn- 
mass and periods being the most helpful. A comma 
is used in two ways in the Remedia corpus: it acts 
as a signal for the conjunction of a group of nouns 
or propernouns, or it acts as punctuation signalling 
an auxiliary phrase (usually a PP) or sentence. In 
the NP conjunction case, the parser groups the con- 
joined nouns or propernouns together as a plural NP. 
In the second case, the sentence is partially parsed. 
The partial parser operates in a bottom-up fashion 
taking as input a POS:tagged and name-identified 
sentence and matching it to the right-hand side of 
the grammar ules. Starting from the beginning of 
the sentence or auxiliary phrase (or sentence), the 
parser looks for the POS tags of the words, trans- 
forming the POS tags into corresponding lexical cat- 
egories and tries to match the RHS of the rules. 
Phrases are maintained on an agenda until they are 
finalized. 
NPs often require merging sincesome consecutive 
NPs form a single multi-word token (i.e., multi-word 
names and conjunctions). An NP that results from 
merging two tokens into a single multi-word token 
has its Base as the rootword of the combined token, 
and AGR and SemType features are updated according 
to the information retrieved from the lexicon based 
on the multi-word token. In the case of an NP con- 
junction, the Base is the union of the Base of each 
NP, AGR is set to 3p, and SemType is assigned as that 
of the head word of the merged NP. The rule for find- 
ing the head word of an NP is: find the F IRST  con- 
secutive noun (propernoun) group in the NP, then 
the LAST  noun (propernoun) in this group is de- 
fined as the head word of the NP. 
The partial parser performs word-sense disam- 
biguation as it parses. Words such as Washington 
have multiple_semtype values in the lexicon for one 
lexical category. The following are rules for word- 
sense disambiguation used by the parser: 
? NP  plus VP  rules for word-sense disambiguation: 
If there are verbs such as name, call, or be, 
which have the semtype of equate, then the NPs  
that precede and follow the VP  have the same 
semtype. 
If a noun is the object of a verb, then the subcat  
feature value of the verb can be used to disam- 
biguate its word sense (e.g., take generally has 
the subcat  of obj+time). 
? PP  rules for word-sense disambiguation: 
For some nouns (propernouns) which are the 
object of a preposition, the intersection of the 
semtype value sets of the preposition word and 
its object determines their semtype. 
? NPs  in the date line of each passage are all ei- 
ther dates or places with the typical order be- 
ing place then time. For example, in (WASH- 
INGTON, June, 1989), Washington is assigned 
semtype of location rather than person. 
To process unknown words (the 1,008 words in the 
testing set that don't appear in the development set) 
in the case of the open lexicon, WordNet is used to 
assign the semtype feature for nouns and verbs, the 
AGR feature for verbs can be obtained in part from 
the POS tag, and AGR for unknown noun words can 
be determined when they are used as the subject of 
a sentence. For the closed lexicon, the only unknown 
words are numbers. If a number is a four-digit num- 
ber starting with 16 to 19 or is followed by A.D or 
B.C. then generally it is a year, so its semtype is de- 
fined as time. Other numbers tend to be modifiers 
or predicates and have the semtype of num. 
2.3 P ronoun Reso lu t ion  Modu le  
A pronoun resolution module was developed using 
the rules given in Allen's text (Allen, 1995) along 
with other rules described in the work of Hobbs 
(Hobbs, 1979). The module takes as input the 
feature-augmented and segmented text provided by 
the partial parser. Hence, the words are marked 
31 
with lexical (including gender) and semantic feature 
information, and the phrase structure is also avail- 
able. After the input file is provided by the Par- 
tial Parser Module, the Pronoun Resolution Module 
searches for the pronouns by looking through the 
NPs identified by the partial parser. Candidate an- 
tecedents are identified and a comparison of the fea- 
tures is made between the pronoun and the possible 
antecedent. The phrase that passes the most rule 
filters is chosen as the antecedent. First and second 
person pronouns are handled by using default val- 
ues (i.e., writer and reader). If the system fails to 
arrive at an antecedent, he pronoun is marked as 
non-referential, which is often the case for pronouns 
like it or they. Some of the most useful rules are 
listed below: 
? Reflexives must refer to an antecedent in the same 
sentence. For simplicity, we chose the closest 
noun preceding the pronoun in the sentence with 
matching Gender, AGR, and SemType. 
? Two NPs that co-refer must agree in AGR, Gender, 
and SemType (e.g., person, location). Since, in 
many cases the gender cannot be determined, this 
information was used only when available. 
? A subject was preferred over the object when the 
pronoun occurred as the subject in a sentence. 
? When it occurs in the beginning of a paragraph, 
it is considered non-referential. 
? We prefer a global entity (the first named entity in 
a paragraph) when there is a feature match. In the 
absence of such, we prefer the closest propernoun 
preceding the pronoun with a feature match. If 
that fails, we prefer the closest preceding noun or 
pronoun with a feature match. 
The accuracy of our pronoun resolution module 
on the training corpus was 79.5% for grade 2 and 
79.4% for grade 5. On testing, it was 81.33% for 
grade 3 and 80.39% for grade 4. The overall accu- 
racy of this module on both the testing and train- 
ing corpus was 80.17%. This was an improvement 
over the baseline Deep Read coreference module 
which achieved a 51.61% accuracy on training and 
a 50.91% accuracy on testing, giving an overall ac- 
curacy of 51.26%. This accuracy was determined 
based on Professor Harper's manual pronoun reso- 
lution of both the training and testing set (the per- 
fect coreference information was not included in the 
distribution of the Deep Read system). 
2.4 Sentence- to -Quest ion  Compar i son  
Modu le  
The Sentence-to-Question Comparison Module 
takes as input a set of tagged stories, for which 
phrase types and features have been identified. 
The semantic and syntactic information is coded as 
shown in Figure 2 (using XML tags). A mechanism 
to quantify a qualitative comparison of questions 
and sentences has been developed. The comparison 
:.'.' 
provides data about how questions compare to their 
answers and how questions compare to non-answers. 
The classification of answers and non-answers i im- 
plemented by using feature comparison vectors of 
phrase-to-phrase comparisons in questions and po- 
tential answer sentences. 
A comparison is made using phrase-to-phrase 
comparisons between each sentence and each ques- 
tion in a passage. In particular, NP-to-NP, VP-to- 
VP, PP-to-PP, and NP-to-PP comparisons are made 
between each sentence and each of the five questions. 
These comparisons are stored for each sentence in 
the following arrays. Note that in these arrays Q 
varies from 1 to 5, signifying the question that the 
sentence matches. F varies over the features for the 
phrase match. 
CN\[Q\]\[F\] Comparison of NP features (F = I{Base, 
h6R, and SemType}D between question 
Q and the sentence. 
CV\[Q\]\[F\] Comparison of VP features (F = i{Base, 
AGR, SemType, Tense}\[) between 
question Q and the sentence. 
CP\[Q\]\[F\] Comparison of PP features (F = \[{NeedBase, 
Prep, PPSemType, NeedSemType}\[) 
between question Q and the sentence. 
CPN\[Q\]\[F\] Comparison of PP features in sentence 
to NP features in question Q. Here F=2,  
comparing lWeedBase and Base, and 
NeedSemType and SemType. 
Values for these comparison matrices were calcu- 
lated for each sentence by comparing the features of 
each phrase type in the sentence to features of the 
indicated phrase types in each of the five questions. 
The individual matrix values describe the compari- 
son of the best match between a sentence and a ques- 
tion for NP-to-NP (the three feature match scores 
for the best matching NP pair of the sentence and 
question Q are stored in CN\[Q\]), VP-to-VP (stored 
in CV\[Q\]), PP-to-PP (stored in CP\[Q\]), and PP-to- 
NP (store in CPN\[Q\]). Selecting the phrase compar- 
ison vector for a phrase type that best matches a 
sentence phrase to a question phrase was chosen as 
a heuristic to avoid placing more importance on a 
sentence only because it contains more information. 
Comparisons between features were calculated us- 
ing the following equations. The first is used when 
comparing features such as Base, NeedBase, and 
Prep, where a partial match must be quantified. 
The second is used when comparing features uch as 
SemType, AGR, and Tense where only exact matches 
make sense.

The matrices for the development set were pro- 
vided to the algorithms in the Answer Module for 
training the component answer classifiers. The ma- 
trices for the testing set were also passed to the al- 
gorithms for testing. Additionally, specific informa- 
tion about the feature values for each sentence was 
passed to the Answer Module. 
2.5 Answer  Modu les  
Several methods were developed in parallel in an 
attempt o learn the features that were central to 
identifying the sentence from a story that correctly 
answer a question. These methods are described in 
the following subsections. Due to time constraints, 
the evaluations of these Answer Modules were car- 
ried out with a closed lexicon and perfect pronoun 
resolution. 
2.5.1 A Neuro--Fuzzy Network  Classif ier 
An Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System 
(ANFIS) (Jang, 1993) from the Matlab Fuzzy Logic 
Toolbox was used as one method to resolve the story 
questions. A separate network was trained for each 
question type in an attempt o make the networks 
learn relationships between phrases that classify an- 
swer sentences and non-answer sentences differently. 
ANFIS has the ability to learn complex relationships 
between its input variables. It was expected that 
by learning the relationships in the training set, the 
resolution of questions could be performed on the 
testing set. 
For ANFIS, the set of sentence-question pairs was 
divided into five groups according to question type. 
Currently the implementation of ANFIS on Matlab 
is restricted to 4 inputs. Hence, we needed to devise 
a way to aggregate the feature comparison informa- 
tion for each comparison vector. The comparison 
vectors for each phrase-to-phrase comparison were 
reduced to a single number for each comparison pair 
(i.e., NP-NP, VP-VP, PP-PP, NP-PP). This reduc- 
tion was performed by multiplying the vector values 
by a normalized weighting constant for the feature 
values (e.g., NP-comparison = (Base weight)*(Base 
comparison value) + (AGR weight)*(AGR compari- 
son value) + (SemType weight)*(SemType compari- 
son value), with the weights umming to 1). In most 
cases that a match is found, the comparison values 
are 1 (exact match). So weights were chosen that al- 
lowed the ANFIS to tell'something about the match 
characteristics (e.g., if the AGR weight is 0.15 and 
the SemType weight is 0.1, and the NP-comparison 
value was 0.25, it can be concluded that the NP 
that matched best between in the sentence-question 
pair had the same AGR and SemType features). The 
aggregation weights were chosen so that all com- 
binations of exact matches on features would have 
unique values and the magnitude of the weights were 
chosen based on the belief that the higher weighted 
features contribute more useful information. The 
weights, ordered to correspond to the features in the 
table on the previous page are: (.55, .15, .3) for CN, 
(.55, .1, .22, .13) for CV, (.55, .15, .2, .1) for CP, and 
(.55, .45) for CPN. 
ANFIS was trained using the update on the de- 
velopment set provided by the Sentence-to-Question 
Comparison Module as described above. During 
testing, the data, provided by the Comparison Mod- 
ule and updated as described above, is used as input 
to ANFIS. The output is a confidence value that de- 
scribes the likelihood of a sentence being a answer. 
Every sentence is compared with every question in 
ANFIS, and then within question, the sentences are 
ranked by the likelihood that they are a question's 
answer. 
The accuracy of the best classifier produced with 
ANFIS was quite poor. In the grade 3 set, we 
achieved an accuracy of 13.33% on who questions, 
6.67% on what questions, 0% on where questions, 
6.67% on when questions, and 3.33% on why ques- 
tions. In the grade 4 set, we achieved an accuracy of 
3.54% on who questions, 10.34% on what questions, 
10.34% on where questions, 0% on when questions, 
and 6.9% on why questions. Although the best rank- 
ing sentence produced poor accuracy results on the 
testing set, with some additional knowledge the top- 
ranking incorrect answers may be able to be elimi- 
nated. The plots in Figure 3 display the number of 
times the answer sentence was assigned a particular 
rank by ANFIS. The rank of the correct sentence 
tends to be in the top 10 fairly often for most ques- 
tion types. This rank tendency is most noticeable 
for who, what and when questions, but it is also 
present for where questions. The rank distribution 
for why questions appears to be random, which is 
consistent with our belief that they require a deeper 
analysis than would be possible with simple feature 
comparisons. 
2.5.2 A Neura l  Network  Classi f ier  
Like ANFIS, this module uses a neural network, but 
it has a different opology and uses an extended fea- 
ture set. The nn (Neureka) neural network sim- 
ulation system (Mat, 1998) was used to create a 
multi-layer (one hidden layer) back-propagation net- 
work. A single training/testing instance was gener- 
ated from each story sentence. The network contains 
an input layer with two groups of features. The sen- 
tence/question feature vectors that compare a sen- 
tence to each of the five story questions comprise the 
first group. Sentence features that are independent 
of the questions, i.e., contains a location, contains a 
time/date, and contains a human, comprise the sec- 
ond group. The hidden layer contains a number of 
nodes that was experimentally varied to achieve best 
performance. The output layer contains five nodes, 
each of which has a binary outpht value which indi- 
cates whether or not the sentence is the answer to 
the corresponding question (i.e., question 1 through 
5). 
Several training trials were performed to deter- 
mine the opt imum parameters for the network. We 
trained using various subsets of the full input fea- 
ture set since some features could be detrimental to 
creating a good classifier. However, in the end, the 
full set of features performed better than or equiva- 
lently to the various subsets. Increasing the number 
of hidden nodes can often improve the accuracy of 
the network because it can learn more complex re- 
lationships; however, this did not help much in the 
current domain, and so the number of hidden nodes 
was set to 16. For this domain, there are many more 
sentences that are not the answer to a question than 
that are. An effort was made to artificially change 
this distribution by replicating the answer sentences 
in the training set; however, no additional accuracy 
was gained by this experimentation. Finally, we cre- 
ated a neural network for each question type as in 
ANFIS; however, these small networks had lower ac- 
curacy than the single network approach. 
The overall test set accuracy of the best neural 
network classifier was 14%. In the grade 3 set, we 
achieved an accuracy of 30% on who questions, 0% 
on what questions, 23.3% on when questions, 13.3% 
on where questions, and 3.3% on why questions. In 
the grade 4 set, we achieved an accuracy of 17.2% 
on who questions, 10.3% on what questions, 23.6% 
on when questions, 10.3% on where questions, and 
3.4% on why questions. 
2.5.3 A Ru le -based  Classi f ier  based  on C5.0 
We attempted to learn rules for filtering out sen- 
tences that are not good candidates as answers to 
questions using C5.0 (Rul, 1999). First we ex- 
tracted information from the sentence-to-question 
correspondence data ignoring the comparison values 
to make the input C5.0-compatible, and produced 
five different files (one for each question type). These 
files were then fed to C5.0; however, the program did 
not produce a useful tree. The problem may have 
been that most sentences in the passages are nega- 
tive instances of answers to questions. 
2.5.4 GAS 
GAS (Jelasity and Dombi, 1998) is a steady genetic 
algorithm with subpopulation support. It is capa- 
ble of optimizing functions with a high number of 
local optima. The initial parameters were set theo- 
retically. In the current matching problem, because 
the number of local opt ima can be high due to the 
coarse level of sentence information (there can be 
several sentence candidates with very close scores), 
this algorithm is preferred over other common ge- 
netic algorithms. This algorithm was trained on the 
training set, but due to the high noise level in the

3 A Closer Look at the Features 
After observing the question answer accuracy results 
of the above classifiers, we concluded that the fea- 
tures we extracted for the classifiers are affected by 
noise. The fact that we take into consideration only 
the top matching phrase-to-phrase matches on a spe- 
cific set of features may have contributed to this 
noisiness. To analyze the noise source of features, 
given that SemType was hypothesized to be essen- 
tial for answer candidate discrimination, we exam- 
ined those SemType values that occurred most fre- 
quently and calculated statistics on how often the 
values occurred in story sentences that are answers 
versus non-answers to the questions. We observed 
the following phenomena: 
1. For who questions, the SemType value person 
plays an important role in ?identifying answer 
sentences, since 83.64% answers have person as 
its NP SemType value, and 21.82% have it as 
its PP NeedSemType value. However, 66.83% of 
the non-answer sentences also have person as its 
NP SemType and 15.85% as its PP NeedSemType. 
Phrases with person SemType appear in most sen- 
tences, whether they are answers or not, and this 
34 
weakens its ability to act as an effective filter. 
2. For what questions, the SemType value person ap- 
pears as the NP SemType of most answer and non- 
answer sentences. The next most dominant fea- 
ture is the SemType value object, which appears 
in the NP for 29.41% of the answer sentences and 
PP NeedSemType for 15.68% of the answer sen- 
tences. Most of the other SemType values such as 
time contribute trivially to distinguishing answers 
from non-answers, as might be expected. 
3. For when questions, person appears dominant 
among NP SemType values; however, time fea- 
tures appear to be second most dominant since 
19.30% of the answer sentences have time as their 
NP SemType, and 26.32% have at-time as their PP 
SemType. N_o.te that the PP NeedSeraType and VP 
SemType appear to be less capable of guiding the 
selection of the correct answer. 
4. For where questions, location features are impor- 
tant with 24.07% answer sentences having loca- 
tion as their NP SemType value, and 20.37% hav- 
ing at-loc as their PP SemType. However, the 
distribution of values for VP SemType and PP 
NeedSemType shows no interesting patterns. 
The current raining strategy weights the NP-NP, 
VP-VP, PP-PP, and NP-PP comparisons equiva- 
lently. The above observations suggest hat training 
classifiers based on these equally weighted compar- 
isons may have prevented the detection of a clear 
class boundary, resulting in poor classification per- 
formance. Since different phrase types do not appear 
to contribute in the same way across different ques- 
tion types, it may be better to generate a rule base 
as a prefitter to assign more weight to certain phrases 
or discard others before inputting the feature vector 
into the classifier for training. 
4 Future  D i rec t ions  
As a next step, we will try to tame our feature set. 
One possibility is to use a rule-based classifier that 
is less impacted by the serious imbalance between 
negative and positive instances than C5.0 in order 
to learn more effective feature sets for answer candi- 
date discrimination corresponding to different ques- 
tion types. We could then use the classifier as a pre- 
processing filter to discard those less relevant com- 
parison vector elements before inputting them into 
the classifiers, instead of inputting comparison re- 
sults based on the complete feature sets. This should 
help to reduce noise generated by irrelevant features. 
Also, we will perform additional data analysis on the 
classification results to gain further insight into the 
noise sources. 
The classifiers we developed covered a wide range 
of approaches. To optimize the classification perfor- 
mance, we would like to implement a voting mod- 
ule to process the answer candidates from different 
classifiers. The confidence rankings of the classifiers 
would be determined f rom their corresponding an- 
swer selection accuracy in the training set, and will 
be used horizontally over the classifiers to provide 
a weighted confidence measure for each sentence, 
giving a final ordered list, where the head of the 
list is the proposed answer sentence. We propose 
to use a voting neural network to train the confi- 
dence weights on different classifiers based on differ- 
ent question types, since we also want to explore the 
relationship of classifier performance with question 
types. We believe this voting scheme will optimize 
the bagging of different classifiers and improve the 
hypothesis accuracy.
