Abstract 
This paper describes a system designed to 
disambiguate person names in a set of Web 
pages. In our approach Web documents are 
represented as different sets of features or 
terms of different types (bag of words, 
URLs, names and numbers). We apply Ag-
glomerative Vector Space clustering that 
uses the similarity between pairs of analo-
gous feature sets. This system achieved a 
value of 66% for F?=0.2 and a value of 48% 
for F?=0.5 in the Web People Search Task at 
SemEval-2007 (Artiles et al, 2007). 
1 Introduction 
Name queries account for a substantial part of Web 
queries in commercial search engines. Name que-
ries often aim at retrieving information about par-
ticular persons. Nevertheless, the same query or 
mention name usually recalls several people and 
the user is unaware of the potential ambiguity and 
expects to find the related person after skimming 
some results.  
Similar problems are also common for products, 
organizations and almost any other named object 
in real world. A related problem appears for differ-
ent kinds of objects receiving the same name. For 
example, Firebird can refer to a car, a guitar, a fic-
tion superhero or a database product among more 
than twenty different senses collected in Wikipe-
dia. In all these cases, the user could benefit from a 
structured representation that facilitates browsing 
results. Other applications like Question Answer-
ing would also benefit from name disambiguation 
and person names disambiguation, in particular. In 
this work we focus on the task of disambiguating 
Web pages retrieved for a person name query as 
proposed in the Web People Search Task at SemE-
val-2007.  
2 Background and Related Research 
In recent work in named entity disambiguation, 
Malin (2005) identifies two different dimensions to 
classify approaches to the task depending on the 
information type that is used and whether the 
method to train the system is supervised or unsu-
pervised. Regarding the information type, Malin 
(2006) identifies personal information like bio-
graphical facts (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998; Mann 
and Yarowsky, 2003) or relational information 
(Bekkerman and McCallum, 05), collocations with 
other entities.  
Personal name disambiguation has been studied 
in relation with citation analysis and record linkage 
and their use to improve Web search results have 
attracted more interest recently (Guha and Garg 
2004; Bollegala, 2006), but it is evaluated only at a 
small scale. In contrast Bekkerman and McCallum 
(2005) have focused on disambiguating complete 
social networks and not only results for one name. 
3 System description 
Web People Search proposes a task to find differ-
ent people sharing the same name referred in a set 
of Web pages and associate each of these pages to 
these people. To solve the task we added two sim-
plifying assumptions; each document refers only to 
one person, and every listed document refers to a 
person. 
362
Our approach is an unsupervised personal name 
disambiguation system according to the classifica-
tion proposed by Malin. In this system the method 
applied to solve ambiguity consists of extracting 
from each document a set of features, that we 
called document context and afterwards to cluster 
them according to their similarity  
3.1 Document representation 
In this task we do not have structured information 
to estimate similarity. For this reason, the first step 
of the system consists of extracting features from 
the documents. Since our goal is to develop tech-
niques that work for large amounts of documents, 
most of the features are based simply on words, 
HTML structure and simple patterns that aim to 
substitute more elaborated features based on in-
formation extraction.  Features might not have a 
direct correspondence with facts that help to iden-
tify a person like date of birth or telephone but, in 
some cases, dealing with them instead of with 
proper semantic information can be a good ap-
proach. On the other hand, some people features, 
as emails or related URLs, are detected through 
simple patterns. Other simple patterns like num-
bers can also provide information about some peo-
ple features.  
All terms identified by the same pattern are rep-
resented as a bag of terms. Document context is 
composed of a set of bags, each containing all the 
terms of the document that were captured with a 
fixed pattern.  
3.2 Types of Contexts 
The bags of terms used in document contexts are 
the following: 
a) emails, b) URLs, c) proper names, d) long 
numbers (more than four figures), e) short numbers 
(up to four figures), f) title terms, g) terms of the 
titles of related documents, h) terms contained in 
the ?meta? tag of the documents, i) terms of em-
phasized text fragments (bold, italic, etc.), j) terms 
of the document snippet, and k) terms of the re-
lated documents snippets. 
The bags b, f, g, j, and k have been extracted 
from the data files provided (snippets, rank, etc.), 
whereas a, c, d, e, h and i have been directly ex-
tracted from result pages.  
From all the bags of terms, we finally selected to 
compound the contexts b, c, d, e, f, g and j as in the 
training set they contributed to obtain the best re-
sult. 
3.3 Term normalization and filtering 
Each extracted term is normalized, filtered and 
weighted before being added to a bag of terms. A 
filter for stopwords is applied to every bag of 
words and they are represented in lowercase. Spu-
rious HTML tags and terms under three characters 
are also considered stopwords. Bag of numbers are 
normalized by removing blanks, hyphens and pa-
renthesis.  
 In addition to stopwords, terms with low fre-
quency, lower than 0.2 times the frequency of the 
more frequent term of each bag of words, are not 
considered. Finally the tf-idf value of every term is 
associated.   
Proper names are extracted with a robust rule 
based name recognizer based on surface feature 
and some trigger words. It should be emphasized 
that over the bag of proper names, a filtering is 
implemented to make the detection of co-referents 
proper names easier when comparing different ar-
rays. In this way, a similarity measure among 
proper names is considered (Camps and Daud?, 
2003) more flexible than the simple comparison of 
their strings of characters. This approach tolerates 
the omission, substitution or inclusion of words in 
the proper name, the alteration in the order of the 
words, or the substitution of words with initials, as 
well as the omission, substitution or inclusion of 
characters. First, all proper names that are in the 
set of documents are identified, and all similar 
proper names according to these relaxed rules are 
grouped by the same common term. In this way, 
arrays of proper names are rewritten, referencing 
each proper name through its common term and 
recalculating its frequency. 
3.4 Clustering algorithm 
Our system uses Agglomerative Vector Space 
Clustering to group and disambiguate pages. Given 
the nature of the problem, it does not need to indi-
cate the number of classes to be obtained in ad-
vance. To determine if two documents should be 
assigned to the same cluster, we evaluate the simi-
larity between each pair of bags of terms and, later, 
it is determined how many of these pairs have a 
similarity over a threshold. For a document to be in 
the same cluster we require a minimum number of 
similar pairs. 
363
In order to allow finer adjustments in the num-
ber of similar pairs needed, instead of requiring N 
similar pairs, the pairs are arranged in a decreasing 
order according to the obtained similarity and it is 
checked if the similarity of the nth pair is above or 
below the threshold. In this case, interpolation can 
be applied, so the number of necessary similar 
pairs is not limited to the natural numbers. The 
developed system uses linear interpolation to cal-
culate this function. 
We use the cosine vector similarity as similarity 
measurement.  
4 Results and Evaluation 
For the evaluation the system has been adjusted 
with a threshold of similarity of 0.001, 2.5 pairs of 
bags of terms above the threshold required for in-
cluding two documents in the same cluster and the 
following bags of terms: bags of URLs, proper 
names, long and short numbers, terms of titles, 
terms of the titles of the related documents and 
terms of the document snippets.  
With this adjustment it is noticed that some prob-
lems affect the results of the evaluation. The most 
important of these problems is the small number of 
clusters in which pages are classified. For instance, 
Mark Johnson refers to 70 different people in key, 
but our system classified his pages in only 14 clus-
ters. Due to this small number of clusters, each 
contains more than one person to search, but with a 
good recall of pages for each person. Table 1 
shows the results obtained for the test set, where P 
is the purity, R is the inverse purity, F?=0.5 repre-
sents the harmonic mean of purity and inverse pu-
rity, and F?=0.2 is the measure of F that considers 
more important inverse purity than purity. 
Although at a first sight set 1 shows better re-
sults than set 2 and 3, once we discard the people 
names ?Sharon Goldwater? and ?Dekang Lin? 
(whose results are above the mean), results are 
very similar for all groups. We consider that our 
system behaves in a homogenous way regardless 
of the proportion of the different types of names 
the sets are composed of: less frequent names (with 
lower ambiguity) and ?celebrity? names (with peo-
ple that dominate the set of pages). 
In the other hand, the assumptions considered to 
solve the problem (each page references at least 
one and only one person) were definitely too na?ve, 
as there is a lot of discarded pages (in some cases 
more than 50% of the pages are not taken into ac-
count) and some pages refer to several people. 
These facts also contribute to make lower purity.

5 Conclusions and future works 
This system obtains a good result for inverse purity 
to the detriment of purity. This causes a difference 
of almost twenty points in the measures of F?=0.5 
and F?=0.2. In order to correct this weakness, in the 
future we will consider that any person can be 
mentioned in different pages, and that not all pages 
reference to any of the people to search. 
Also we will perform additional experiments   
regarding parameter tuning. Although the number 
of similar contexts considered in these experiments 
364
is 1.5 (value that maximizes the measure of F), 
results show that this value causes larger groups 
than those found in search results. Probably a 
smaller value for this parameter will divide pages 
in more clusters, improving the purity of the result. 
Finally, we would like to consider different 
methods to select relevant terms.
