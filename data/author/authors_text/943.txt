Because of their constant renewal, it is nec- 
essary to acquire fresh named entities (NEs) 
from recent ext sources. We present a tool 
for the acquisition and the typing of NEs from 
the Web that associates a harvester and three 
parallel shallow parsers dedicated to specific 
structures (lists, enumerations, and anchors). 
The parsers combine lexical indices such as 
discourse markers with formatting instruc- 
tions (HTML tags) for analyzing enumera- 
tions and associated initializers. 
1 Overv iew 
Lexical acquisition from large corpora has 
long been considered as a means for enrich- 
ing vocabularies (Boguraev and Pustejovsky, 
1996). Depending on the studies, different is- 
sues are considered: the acquisition of terms 
(Daille, 1996), the acquisition of subcatego- 
rization frames (Basili et al, 1993), the acqui- 
sition of semantic links (Grefenstette, 1994), 
etc. While traditional electronic orpora such 
as journal articles or corpus resources (BNC, 
SUSANNE, Brown corpus) are satisfactory for 
classical lexical acquisition, Web corpora are 
another source of knowledge (Crimmins et al, 
1999) that can be used to acquire NEs because 
of the constant updating of online data. 
The purpose of our work is to propose a 
technique for the extraction of NEs from the 
Web through the combination of a harvester 
and shallow parsers. Our study also belongs 
to corpus-based acquisition of semantic re- 
lationships through the analysis of specific 
lexico-syntactic contexts (Hearst, 1998) be- 
cause hypernym relationships are acquired to- 
gether with NEs. The unique contribution 
of our technique is to offer an integrated ap- 
proach to the analysis of HTML documents 
that associates lexical cues with formatting 
instructions in a single and cohesive frame- 
work. The combination of structural informa- 
tion and linguistic patterns is also found in 
wrapper induction, an emerging topic of re- 
search in artificial intelligence and machine 
learning (Kushmerick et al, 1997). 
Our work differs from the MUC-related NE 
tagging task and its possible extension to 
name indexing of web pages (Aone et al, 
1997) for the following reasons: 
? The purpose of our task is to build lists of 
NEs, not to tag corpora. For this reason, 
we only collect non-ambiguous context- 
independent NEs; partial or incomplete 
occurrences such as anaphora re consid- 
ered as incorrect. 
? The types of NEs collected here are much 
more accurate than the four basic types 
defined in MUC. The proposed tech- 
nique could be extended to the collec- 
tion of any non-MUC names which can 
be grouped under a common hypernym: 
botanic names, mechanical parts, book 
titles, events... 
? We emphasize the role of document s ruc- 
ture in web-based collection. 
2 Focus ing  on Def in i to ry  Contexts  
Two issues are addressed in this paper: 
1. While traditional electronic orpora can 
be accessed irectly and entirely through 
large-scale filters such as shallow parsers, 
access to Web pages is restricted to 
the narrow and specialized medium of a 
search engine. In order to spot and re- 
trieve relevant ext chunks, we must fo- 
cus on linguistic ues that can be used to 
access pages containing typed NEs with 
high precision. 
2. While Web pages are full of NEs, only a 
small proportion of them are relevant for 
the acquisition of public, fresh and well- 
known NEs (the name of someone's cat 
181 
is not relevant o our purpose). So that 
automatically acquired NEs can be used 
in a NE recognition task, they are asso- 
ciated with types such as actor (PER- 
SON), lake (LOCATION), or university 
(ORGANIZATION). 
The need for selective linguistic ues (wrt to 
the current facilities offered by search engines) 
and for informative and typifying contexts has 
led us to focus on collections, a specific type of 
definitory contexts (Pdry-Woodley, 1998). Be- 
cause they contain specific linguistic triggers 
such as following or such as, definitory con- 
texts can be accessed through phrase queries 
to a search engine. In addition, these contexts 
use the classical scheme genus/differentia to 
define NEs, and thus provide, through the 
genus, a hypernym of the NEs they define. 
Our study extends (Hearst, 1998) to Web- 
based and spatially formatted corpora. 
3 Arch i tec ture  and  Pr inc ip les  
To acquire NEs from the Web, we have devel- 
oped a system that consists of three sequential 
modules (see Figure 1): 
1. A harvester that downloads the pages re- 
trieved by a search engine from the four 
following query strings 
(1.a) following (NE) (1.c) (NE) such as 
(1.b) list of (NE) (1.d) such (NE) as 
in which (NE) stands for a typifying 
hypernym of NEs such as Universities, 
politicians, or car makers (see list in 4). 
. Three parallel shallow parsers Pc, P1 and 
Pa which extract candidate NEs respec- 
tively from enumerations, lists and ta- 
bles, and anchors. 
. A post-filtering module that cleans up the 
candidate NEs from leading determiners 
or trailing unrelated words and splits co- 
ordinated NEs into unitary items. 
Corpus Harvesting 
The four strings (1.a-d) given above are used 
to query a search engine. They consist of an 
hypernym and a discourse marker. They are 
expected to be followed by a collection of NEs.

The first collection is an enumerat ion  and 
consists of a coordination of three NEs. The 
second collection is a list organized into two 
sublists. Each sublist is introduced by a hy- 
pernym. The third structure is a list marked 
by bullets. Such lists can be constructed 
through an HTML table (this example), or 
by using enumeration marks (<ul> or <ol>). 
The fourth example is also a list built by us- 
ing a table structure but displays a more com- 
plex spatial organization and does not em- 
ploy graphical bullets. The fifth example is 
an anchor  to a collection ot provided to the 
reader within the document, but which can be 
reached by following an hyperlink instead. 
The corpus of HTML pages is collected 
through two search engines with different ca- 
pabilities: AltaVista (AV) and Northern Light 
(NL).2 AV offers the facility of double-quoting 
the query strings in order to search for exact 
strings (also called phrases in IR). NL does 
not support phrase search. However, in AV, 
the number of retrievable documents i  limited 
to the 200 highest ranked documents while it 
is potentially unlimited in NL. For NL, the 
1 (NE) is international organzzations, here. The ty- 
pographical mark-up of the query string in the figure 
is ours. The hypernym is in bold italics and the dis- 
course marker is in bold. 
2The harvester that retrieves Web pages through a 
search engine is a combination of wget available from 
ftp://sunsite, auc. dk/pub/infosystems/wget/ and 
Perl scripts.

It's development is due to the support gwen by the Ministry of Pubhc Health, aided by

United Nations Development program, and the Caribbean and Latin American Medical Science 
Information Center.

Figure 2: Five different ypes of formatting used for enumerating NEs. 
number of retrieved ocuments was however 
restricted to 2000 in order to limit process- 
ing times. The choice of these two search en- 
gines is intended to evaluate whether a poorer 
query mode (bags of words in NL instead of 
strings in AV) can be palliated by accessing 
more documents (2000 max. for NL instead 
of 200 max. for AV). 
The corpus collected by the two search 
engines and the four f~.milies of queries is 
2,958Mb large (details are given in Section 4). 
Acquis i t ion of  Candidate  NEs  
Three parallel shallow parsers Pc, P\]. and Pa 
are used to extract NEs from the corpora col- 
lected by the harvester. The parsers rely on 
the query string to detect he sentence intro- 
ducing the collection of NEs (the initializer in 
(P~ry-Woodley, 1998)). The text and HTML 
marks after the initializer are parsed jointly 
in order to retrieve one of the following three 
spatio-syntactic structures: 
1. a textual enumeration (parser Pc, top- 
183 
most example in Figure 2), 
2. a list or a table (parser Pl, the next three 
examples in Figure 2), 
3. an anchor toward a page containing a list 
(parser Pa, bottom example in Figure 2). 
In brief, these parsers combine string 
matching (the initial lexical cue), syntactic 
analysis (enumerations in Pe), analysis of for- 
matting instructions (lists and tables in Pl), 
and access to linked documents through an- 
chors detected by Pa. The results presented in
this paper only concern the first two parsers. 
Since anchors raise specific problems in lin- 
guistic analysis (Amitay, 1999), they will be 
analyzed in another pubhcation. The result- 
ing candidate NEs are cleaned up and filtered 
by a post-filtering module that splits associa- 
tions of NEs, suppresses initial determiners or
trailing modifiers and punctuations, and re- 
jects incorrect NEs. 
The  Enumerat ion  Parser  Pe 
The enumerations are expected to occur in- 
side the sentences containing the query string. 
Pe uses a traditional approach to parsing 
through conjunction splitting in which a NE 
pattern NE is given by (3) and an enumera- 
tion by (4). 3 
NE = (\[A-Z \ &\]\[a-zA-Z \-\'\]* )+ (3) 
Enum = (NE, )*WE(, ?) (andlor) WE (4) 
The List Parser  P1 
The lists are expected to occur no further than 
four lines after the sentence containing the 
query string. The lists are extracted through 
one of the following three patterns. They cor- 
respond to three alternatives commonly used 
by HTML authors in order to build a spa- 
tial construction of aligned items (lists, line 
breaks, or tables). They are expressed by 
case-insensitive r gular expressions in which 
the selected string is the shortest  acceptable 
underlined pattern: 
<li> ? (</ti> I<ti> I</ot> I</~t>?5) 
<~> ? </~> (6) 
(<td> I<th>) ._" (<td> \[<th> I</td> (7) 
I</th> I</table> ) 
3The patterns are slightly more complicated in or- 
der to accept diacriticized letters, and possible abbre- 
viations composed of a single letter followed by a dot. 
In addition, after the removal of the HTML 
mark-up tags, only the longest subpart of the 
string accepted by (3) is produced as output 
to the final filter. These patterns do not cover 
all the situations in which a formatted text de- 
notes a list. Some specific ases of lists such as 
pre-formatted text in a verbatim environment 
(<we>), or items marked by a paragraph tag 
(<p>) are not considered here. They would 
produce too inaccurate results because they 
are not typical enough of lists. 
Postf i l ter lng 
The pre-candidate NEs produced by the shal- 
low parsers are processed by filters before be- 
ing proposed as candidate NEs. The roles of 
the filters are (in this order): 
? removal of trailing lower-case words, 
? deletion of the determiner the and the co- 
ordinating conjunctions and and or and 
the words which follow them, 
? rejection of pre-candidates that contain 
the characters @, {, # , ", $, ! or ?. 
? suppression of item marks such as 1., - - ,  
? or a), 
? suppression of HTML markups, 
? suppression of leading coordinating con- 
junctions, 
? suppression of appositive sequences after 
a comma or a hyphen, 
? transformation f upper-case words into 
initial upper-case in non-organization 
candidate NEs because only organization 
names are expected to contain acronyms, 
? rejection of NEs containing words in a 
stop list such as Next, Top, Web, or Click. 
Postfiltering is completed by discarding 
single-word candidates, that are described as 
common words in the CELEX 4 database, and 
multi-word candidates that contain more than 
5 words. 
4 Exper iments  and  Eva luat ions  
Data  Co l lec t ion  
The acquisition of NEs is performed on 34 
types of NEs chosen arbitrarily among three 
subtypes of the MUC typology:

ORGANIZATION (American companies, 
international organizations, universities, po- 
litical organizations, international agencies, 
car makers, terrorist groups, financial insti- 
tutions, museums, international companies, 
holdings, sects, and realtors), 
PERSON (politicians, VIPs, actors, man- 
agers, celebrities, actresses, athletes, authors, 
film directors, top models, musicians, singers, 
and journalists), and 
LOCATION (countries, regions, states, 
lakes, cities, rivers, mountains, and islands). 
Each of these 34 types (a (NE) string) 
is combined with the four discourse mark- 
ers given in (1.a-d), yielding 136 queries for 
the two search engines. Each of the 272 cor- 
pora collected through the harvester is made 
of the 200 documents downloadable through 
AV for the phrase search (or less if less are 
retrieved) and 2,000 documents though NL. 
Each of these corpora is parsed by the enu- 
meration and the list parsers. 
Two aspects of the data are evaluated. 
First, the size of the yield is measured in order 
to compare the productivity of the 272 queries 
according to the type of query (type of NE 
and type of discourse marker) and the type 
.of search engine (rich versus plain queries and 
low versus high number of downloaded ocu- 
ments). Second, the quality of the candidate 
NEs is measured through uman inspection of 
accessible Web pages containing each NE. 
Corpus Size 
The 272 corpora are 2,958 Mb large: 368 
Mb for the corpora collected through AV and 
2,590 Mb for those obtained through NL. De- 
tailed sizes of corpora are shown in Table 1. 
The corpora collected through NL for the pat- 
tern list o/ (NE / represent more than a half 
of the NL collection (1,307 Mb). The most 
productive pattern for AV is (NE) such as 
through which 41% of the AV collection is 
downloaded (150 Mb). 
The sizes of the corpora also depends on 
the type of NEs. For each search engine, the 
total sizes are reported for each pattern (1.a- 
d). In addition, the largest corpus for each 
of the three types of NEs is indicated in the 
last three lines. The variety of sizes and dis- 
tribution among the types of NEs shows that 
using search engines with different capabili- 
ties yields different figures for the collections 
of pages. Therefore, the subsequent process of 
NE acquisition heavily depends on the means 
used to collect the basic textual data from 
which knowledge is acquired. 
Quantitative Evaluation of Acquisition 
Table 2 presents, for each pattern and each 
search engine, the number of candidates, the 
productivity, the ratios of the number of enu- 
merations to lists, and the rate of redundancy. 
In all, 17,176 candidates are produced 
through AV and 34,978 through NL. The low- 
est accuracy of the NL query mode is well pal- 
liated by a larger collection of pages. 
P roduct iv i ty .  The productivity is the ra- 
tio of the number of candidates to the size 
of the collection. Using a unit of number of 
candidates per Mb, the productivity of AV is 
46.7 while it is 3.5 times lower for NL (13.5). 
Thus, collecting NEs from a coarser search en- 
gine, such as NL, requires downloading 3.5 
times larger corpora for the same yield. A 
finer search engine with phrase query facili- 
ties, such as AV, is more economical with re- 
spect to knowledge acquisition based on dis- 
course markers. 
As was the case for the size of the col- 
lection, the productivity of the corpora also 
depends on the types of NEs. Universi- 
ties (28.1), celebrities (53.0) and countries 
(36.5) are the most productive NEs in their 
categories while international agencies (4.0), 
film directors (4.4) and states (8.7) are the 
less productive ones. These discrepancies 
certainly depend on the number of existing 
names in these categories. For instance, there 
are many more names of celebrities than .film 
directors. In fact, the productivity of NL is 
significantly lower than the productivity of AV 
only for the pattern list of NE. Since this pat- 
tern corresponds to the largest corpus (see Ta- 
ble 1), its poor performance in acquisition has 
a strong impact on the overall productivity 
of NL. Avoiding this pattern would make NL 
more suitable for acquisition with a produc- 
tivity of 23.2 (only 2 times lower than AV). 
Rat ios  enumerat ions / l i s t s .  The ratios 
in the third lines of the tables correspond to 
the quotient of the number of candidates ac- 
quired by analyzing enumerations (Pe parser) 
to the number of candidates obtained from 
the analysis of lists (P1 parser). Following 
NE mainly yields NEs through the analysis 
of lists, probably because numerations u ing 
coordinations are better introduced by such 
as. The outcome is more balanced for list 
of NE. It could be expected that this pat-

tern tends to introduce only lists, but there 
are only 1.66 times more NEs obtained from 
lists than from enumerations through list off 
NE. The large number of NEs produced from 
enumerations after this pattern certainly re- 
lies on the combination of linguistics and for- 
matting cues in the construction of meaning. 
The writer avoids using (the word) list when 
the text is followed by a (physical) list. Lastly, 
in all, 11 times more NEs are obtained from 
enumerations than from lists after the pattern 
NE such as, and 18 times more after such NE 
as. This shows that the linguistic pattern such 
as preferably introduces textual enumerations 
through coordinations (Hearst, 1998). 
Redundancy .  There are two main causes 
of redundancy in acquisition. A first cause is 
that the same NE can be acquired from sev- 
eral collections in the same corpus. Redun- 
dancy in the fourth lines of the tables is the 
ratio of duplicates among the yield of can- 
didate NEs for each search engine and each 
query. This value is relatively stable what- 
ever the search engine or the query pattern. 
On average, redundancy is 2.09: each candi- 
date is acquired slightly more than two times. 
Acquisition through NL is slightly more re- 
.~:dundant (2.18) than through AV (1.92). This 
difference is not significant since the number 
of NEs acquired through NL is twice as large 
as the number of NEs acquired through AV. 
Over lap.  Another cause of multiple acqui- 
sition is due to the concurrent exploitation of 
two search engines. If these engines were using 
similar techniques to retrieve documents, the 
overlap would be large. Since we have chosen 
two radically different modes of query (phrase 
vs. bag-of-word technique), the overlap---the 
ratio of the number common candidates to 
the number of total candidates--is low (15%). 
The two search engines seem to be comple- 
mentary rather than competitive because they 
retrieve different sets of documents. 
P rec i s ion  of Acqu is i t ion  
In all, 31,759 candidates are produced by 
postfiltering the acquisition from the corpora 
retrieved by the two search engines. A set of 
504 candidates i randomly chosen for the pur- 
pose of evaluation. For each candidate, AV is 
queried with a phrase containing the string of 
the NE. The topmost 20 pages retrieved by 
AV are downloaded and then used for manual 
inspection in case of doubt about the actual 
status of the candidate. We assume that if 
a candidate is correct, an unambiguous refer- 
ence with the expected type should be found 
at least in one of the topmost 20 pages. 
Two levels of precision are measured: 
1. A NE is correct if its full name is re- 
trieved and if its fine-grained type (the 34 
types given at the beginning of this sec- 
tion) is correct. The manual inspection 
of the 504 candidates indicates a preci- 
sion of 62.8%. 
2. A NE is correct if its full name is retrieved 
and if its MUC type (ORGANIZATION, 
PERSON, or LOCATION) is correct. In 
this case, the precision is 73.6%. 
The errors can be classified into the follow- 
ing categories: 
Wrong type  Many errors in NE typing are 
due to an incorrect connection between a
query pattern and a collection in a doc- 
ument. For instance, Ashley Judd is in- 
correctly reported as an athlete (she is an 
actress) from the occurrence 
His clientele includes stars and 
athletes uch as Ashley Judd 
(below) and Mats Sundin. 
The error is due to a partial analysis of 
the initializer (underlined above). Only 
athletes is seen as the hypernym while 
stars is also part of it. A correct anal- 
ysis of the occurrence would have led to 
a type ambiguity. In this context, there is 
no clue for deciding whether Ashley Judd 
is a star or an athlete. 
Other wrong types are due to poly- 
semy. For instance, HorseFlySwarm is 
extracted from a list of actors in a page 
describing the commands and procedures 
for programming a video game. Here ac- 
tors has the meaning of a virtual actor, 
a procedure in a programming environ- 
ment, and not a movie star. 
Incomplete  Partial extraction of candidates 
is mainly due to parsing errors or to col- 
lections containing partial names of enti- 
ties. 
As an illustration of the second case, the 
author's name Goffman is drawn from 
the occurrence 
Readings are drawnf rom the 
work o\] such authors as Laing, 
187 
Szasz, Goffman, Sartre, Bate- 
son, and Freud. 
Since this enumeration ,does not contain 
the first names of the authors, it is not 
appropriate for an acquisition of unam- 
biguous author's names. 
Other names such as Lucero are ambigu- 
ous even though they are completely ex- 
tracted because they correspond to a first 
name or to a name that is part of sev- 
eral other ones. They are also counted 
as errors since they will be responsible of 
spurious identifications in a name tagging 
task. 
Over -complete  Excessive extractions are 
due to parsing errors or to collections that 
contain words accompanying names that 
are incorrectly collected together with 
the name. For instance, Director Lewis 
Burke FFrumkes is extracted as an au- 
thor's name from a list in which the ac- 
tual name Lewis Burke Frumkes is pre- 
ceded by the title Director. 
Misce l laneous  Other types of errors do not 
show clear connection between the ex- 
tracted sequence and a NE. They are 
mainly due to errors in the analysis of 
the web page. 
These types of errors are distributed as fol- 
lows: wrong type 25%, incomplete 24%, over- 
complete 8% and miscellaneous 43%. 
5 Ref inement  o f  the  Types  o f  NEs  
So far, the type of the candidate NEs is pro- 
vided by the NE hypernym given in (1.a-d). 
However, the initializer preceding the collec- 
tion of NEs to be extracted can contain more 
information on the type of the following NEs. 
In fact the initializer fulfills four distinct func- 
tions: 
1. introduces the presence and the proxim- 
ity of the collection, e.g. Here is 
2. describes the structure of the collection, 
e.g. a list of 
3. gives the type of each item of the collec- 
tion, e.g. universities 
4. specifies the particular characteristics of 
each item. e.g. universities in Vietnam 
The cues used by the harvester are elements 
which either introduce the collection (e.g. the 
.following) or describe the structure (e.g. a 
list of). In initializers in general, these first 
2 functions need not be expressed explicitly 
by lexical means, as the layout itself indi- 
cates the presence and type of the collection. 
Readers exploit the visual properties of writ- 
ten text to aid the construction of meaning 
(P6ry-Woodley, 1998). 
However it is necessary to be explicit when 
defining the items of the collection as this 
information is not available to the reader 
via structural properties. Initializers gener- 
ally contain additional characteristics of the 
items which provide the differentia (under- 
lined here): 
This is a list off American companies 
with business interests in Latvia. 
This example is the most explicit form an ini- 
tializer can take as it contains a lexical ele- 
ment which corresponds to each of the four 
functions outlined above. It is fairly simple to 
extract the details of the items from initializ- 
ers with this basic form, as the modification 
of the hypernym takes the form of a relative 
clause, a prepositional phrase or an adjectival 
phrase. A detailed grammar of this form of 
initializer is as shown in Figure 3. 5

We tag the collection by part of speech us- 
ing the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1999). The el- 
ements which express the differentia are ex- 
tracted by means of pattern matching: they 
are always the modifiers of the plural noun in 
the string, which is the hypernym of the items 
of the collection. 
5pp = prepositional phrase, Ns = noun (singular), 
Npl = noun (plural), Vp = verb in present tense, rel.cl. 
= relative clause.

Initializers containing the search string such 
as behave somewhat differently. They are 
syntactically incomplete, and the missing con- 
stituent is provided by each item of the col- 
lection (Virbel, 1985). These phrases vary 
considerably in structure and can require rela- 
tively complex syntactic rearrangement to ex- 
tract the properties of the hypernym. We will 
not discuss these in more detail here. 
One type of error in this system occurs 
when a paragraph containing the search string 
is followed by an unrelated list. For example 
the harvester recognizes 
Ask the long list of American com- 
panies who have unsuccessfully mar- 
keted products in Japan. 
as an initializer when in fact it is not related to 
any collection. If it happened to be followed 
on the page by an collection of any kind the 
system would mistakenly collect the items as 
NEs of the type specified by the search string. 
The cue list of is commonly used in dis- 
cursive texts, so some filtering is required to 
identify collections which are not employed as 
initializers and to reduce the collection of er- 
roneous items. Analyzing the syntactic forms 
h:has allowed us to construct a set of regular 
expressions which are used to eliminate non- 
initializers and disregard any items collected 
following them. 
We have extracted 1813 potential initial- 
izers from the corpus of HTML pages col- 
lected via AV & NL for the query string list 
of NE. Using lexico-syntactic patterns in or- 
der to identify correct initializers, we have de- 
signed a shallow parser for filtering and ana- 
lyzing the strings. This parser consists of 14 
modules, 4 of which carry out pre-filtering to 
prepare and tag the corpus, and 10 of which 
carry out a fine-grained syntactic analysis, re- 
moving collections that do not function as ini- 
tializers. After filtering, the corpus contains 
520 collections. The process has a precision 
of 78% and a recall of 90%.

This study is another application that demon- 
strates the usability of the WWW as a re- 
source for NLP (see, for instance, (Grefen- 
stette, 1999) for an application of using 
WWW frequencies in selecting translations). 
It also confirms the interest of non-textual lin- 
guistic features, such as formatting markups, 
inNLP for structured ocuments such as Web 
pages. Further work on Web-based NE acqui- 
sition could take advantage of machine learn- 
ing techniques as used for wrapper induction 
(Kushmerick et al, 1997).
