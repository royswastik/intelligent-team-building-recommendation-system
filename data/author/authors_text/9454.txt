Abstract 
Recognizing the emotive meaning of text 
can add another dimension to the under-
standing of text. We study the task of 
automatically categorizing sentences in a 
text into Ekman?s six basic emotion cate-
gories. We experiment with corpus-based 
features as well as features derived from 
two emotion lexicons. One lexicon is 
automatically built using the classification 
system of Roget?s Thesaurus, while the 
other consists of words extracted from 
WordNet-Affect. Experiments on the data 
obtained from blogs show that a combina-
tion of corpus-based unigram features with 
emotion-related features provides superior 
classification performance. We achieve F-
measure values that outperform the rule-
based baseline method for all emotion 
classes. 
1 Introduction 
Recognizing emotions conveyed by a text can pro-
vide an insight into the author?s intent and senti-
ment, and can lead to better understanding of the 
text?s content. Emotion recognition in text has re-
cently attracted increased attention of the NLP 
community (Alm et al, 2005; Liu et al 2003; Mi-
halcea and Liu, 2006); it is also one of the tasks at 
Semeval-20071.  
Automatic recognition of emotions can be ap-
plied in the development of affective interfaces for

shop on Semantic Evaluations, 2007, Prague 
(nlp.cs.swarthmore.edu/semeval/tasks/task14/summary.shtml).  
Computer-Mediated Communication and Human-
Computer Interaction. Other areas that can poten-
tially benefit from automatic emotion analysis are 
personality modeling and profiling (Liu and Maes, 
2004), affective interfaces and communication sys-
tems (Liu et al 2003; Neviarouskaya et al, 2007a) 
consumer feedback analysis, affective tutoring in 
e-learning systems (Zhang et al, 2006), and text-
to-speech synthesis (Alm et al, 2005). 
In this study, we address the task of automati-
cally assigning an emotion label to each sentence 
in the given dataset, indicating the predominant 
emotion type expressed in the sentence. The possi-
ble labels are happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, 
surprise, fear and no-emotion. Those are Ekman?s 
(1992) six basic emotion categories, and an addi-
tional label to account for the absence of a clearly 
discernible emotion. 
We experiment with two types of features for 
representing text in emotion classification based on 
machine learning (ML). Features of the first type 
are a corpus-based unigram representation of text. 
Features of the second type comprise words that 
appear in emotion lexicons. One such lexicon con-
sists of words that we automatically extracted from 
Roget?s Thesaurus (1852). We chose words for 
their semantic similarity to a basic set of terms that 
represent each emotion category. Another lexicon 
builds on lists of words for each emotion category, 
extracted from WordNet-Affect (Strapparava and 
Valitutti, 2004). 
We compare the classification results for groups 
of features of these two types. We get good results 
when the features are combined in a series of ML 
experiments.

2 Related Work 
Research in emotion recognition has focused on 
discerning emotions along the dimensions of va-
lence (positive / negative) and arousal (calm / ex-
cited), and on recognizing distinct emotion catego-
ries. We focus on the latter.  
Liu et al (2003) use a real-world commonsense 
knowledge base to classify sentences into Ekman?s 
(1992) basic emotion categories. They use an en-
semble of rule-based affect models to determine 
the emotional affinity of individual sentences. 
Neviarouskaya et al (2007b) also use rules to de-
termine the emotions in sentences in blog posts; 
their analysis relies on a manually prepared data-
base of words, abbreviations and emoticons la-
beled with emotion categories. 
Since these papers do not report conventional 
performance metrics such as precision and recall, 
the effectiveness of their methods cannot be judged 
empirically. They also disregard statistical learning 
methods as ineffective for emotion recognition at 
sentence level. They surmise that the small size of 
the text input (a sentence) gives insufficient data 
for statistical analysis, and that statistical methods 
cannot handle negation. In this paper, we show that 
ML-based approach with the appropriate combina-
tion of features can be applied to distinguishing 
emotions in text. 
Previous work has used lexical resources such as 
WordNet to automatically acquire emotion-related 
words for emotion classification experiments. 
Starting from a set of primary emotion adjectives, 
Alm et al (2005) retrieve similar words from 
WordNet utilizing all senses of all words in the 
synsets that contain the adjectives. They also ex-
ploit the synonym and hyponym relations in 
WordNet to manually find words similar to nomi-
nal emotion words. Kamps and Marx (2002) use 
WordNet?s synset relations to determine the affec-
tive meaning of words. They assign multi-
dimensional scores to individual words based on 
the minimum path length between them and a pair 
of polar words (such as ?good? and ?bad?) in 
WordNet?s structure. 
There is also a corpus-driven method of deter-
mining the emotional affinity of words: learn prob-
abilistic affective scores of words from large cor-
pora. Mihalcea and Liu (2006) have used this 
method to assign a happiness factor to words de-
pending on the frequency of their occurrences in 
happy-labeled blogposts compared to their total 
frequency in the corpus. 
In this paper, we study a new approach to auto-
matically acquiring a wide variety of words that 
express emotions or emotion-related concepts, us-
ing Roget?s Thesaurus (1852). 
3 Emotion-Labeled Data 
We have based our study on data collected from 
blogs. We chose blogs as data source because they 
are potentially rich in emotion content, and contain 
good examples of real-world instances of emotions 
expressed in text. Additionally, text in blogs does 
not conform to the style of any particular genre per 
se, and thus offers a variety in writing styles, 
choice and combination of words, as well as topics. 
So, the methods learned for discerning emotion 
using blog data are quite general and therefore 
applicable to a variety of genres rather than to 
blogs only. 
We retrieved blogs using seed words for all 
emotion categories. Four human judges manually 
annotated the blog posts with emotion-related 
information - every sentence received two 
judgments. The annotators were required to mark 
each sentence with one of the eight labels: 
happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, surprise, fear, 
mixed-emotion, and no-emotion. The mixed-
emotion label was included to handle those 
sentences that had more than one type of emotion 
or whose emotion content could not fit into any of 
the given emotion categories. Sample sentences 
from the annotated corpus are shown in Fig. 1. 
We measured the inter-annotator agreement us-
ing Cohen?s (1960) kappa. The average pair-wise 
agreement for different emotion categories ranged 
from 0.6 to 0.79. In the experiments reported in 
this paper, we use only those sentences for which 
there was agreement between both judgments (to 
form a benchmark for the evaluation of the results 
of automatic classification). The distribution of 
emotion categories in the corpus used in our ex-
periments is shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Distribution of emotion classes 
4 A Baseline Approach 
We are interested in investigating if emotion in text 
can be discerned on the basis of its lexical content. 
A na?ve approach to determining the emotional 
orientation of text is to look for obvious emotion 
words, such as ?happy?, ?afraid? or ?astonished?. 
The presence of one or more words of a particular 
emotion category in a sentence provides a good 
premise for interpreting the overall emotion of the 
sentence. This approach relies on a list of words 
with prior information about their emotion type, 
and uses it for sentence-level classification. The 
obvious advantage is that no training data are re-
quired. 
For evaluation purposes, we took this approach 
to develop a baseline system that counts the num-
ber of emotion words of each category in a sen-
tence, and then assigns this sentence the category 
with the largest number of words. Ties were re-
solved by choosing the emotion label according to 
an arbitrarily predefined ordering of emotion 
classes. A sentence containing no emotion word of 
any type was assigned the no emotion category. 
This system worked with word lists 2  extracted 
                                                
2  Emotion words from WordNet-Affect 
(http://www.cse.unt.edu/~rada/affectivetext/data/WordNet
AffectEmotionLists.tar.gz)  
from WordNet-Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 
2004) for six basic emotion categories. 
Table 2 shows the precision, recall, and F-
measure values for the baseline system. As we 
have seven classes in our experiments, the class 
imbalance makes accuracy values less relevant 
than precision, recall and F-measure. That is why 
we do not report accuracy values in our results. 
The baseline system shows precision values 
above 50% for all but two classes. This shows the 
usefulness of this approach. This method, however, 
fails in the absence of obvious emotion words in 
the sentence, as indicated by low recall values. 
Thus, in order to improve recall, we need to in-
crease the ambit of words that are considered emo-
tion-related. An alternative approach is to use ML 
to learn automatically rules that classify emotion in 
text.

Happiness 0.589 0.390 0.469

No-emotion 0.434 0.867 0.579

line system 
5 Approach Based on Machine Learning  
We study two types of features: corpus-based fea-
tures and features based on emotion lexicons. 
5.1 Corpus-based features 
The corpus-based features exploit the statistical 
characteristics of the data on the basis of the n-
gram distribution. In our experiments, we take uni-
grams (n=1) as features. Unigram models have 
been previously shown to give good results in sen-
timent classification tasks (Kennedy and Inkpen, 
2006; Pang et al, 2002): unigram representations 
can capture a variety of lexical combinations and 
distributions, including those of emotion words. 
This is particularly important in the case of blogs, 
whose language is often characterized by frequent 
use of new words, acronyms (such as ?lol?), ono-
matopoeic words (?haha?, ?grrr?), and slang, most 
of which can be captured in a unigram representa-
This was the best summer I have 
ever experienced.  (happiness) 
I don?t feel like I ever have that 
kind of privacy where I can talk 
to God and cry and figure things 
out. (sadness) 
Finally, I got fed up. (disgust) 
I can?t believe she is finally here! (surprise) 
Fig 1. Sample sentences from the corpus

tion. Another advantage of a unigram representa-
tion is that it does not require any prior knowledge 
about the data under investigation or the classes to 
be identified. 
For our experiments, we selected all unigrams 
that occur more than three times in the corpus. This 
eliminates rare words, as well as foreign-language 
words and spelling mistakes, which are quite 
common in blogs. We also excluded words that 
occur in a list of stopwords - primarily function 
words that do not generally have emotional conno-
tations. We used the SMART list of stopword3, 
with minor modifications. For instance, we re-
moved from the stop list words such as ?what? and 
?why?, which may be used in the context of ex-
pressing surprise. 
5.2 Features derived from Roget?s Thesaurus 
We utilized Roget?s Thesaurus (Jarmasz and 
Szpakowicz, 2001) to automatically build a lexicon 
                                                
3 SMART stopwords list. Used with the SMART information 
retrieval system at Cornell University 
(ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/smart/english.stop) 
of emotion-related words. The features based on an 
emotion lexiconrequire prior knowledge about 
emotion relatedness of words. We extracted this 
knowledge from the classification system in 
Roget?s, which groups related concepts into vari-
ous levels of a hierarchy. For a detailed account of 
this classification structure, see Jarmasz and 
Szpakowicz (2001). 
Roget?s structure allows the calculation of se-
mantic relatedness between words, based on the 
path length between the nodes in the structure that 
represent those words. In case of multiple paths, 
the shortest path is considered. Jarmasz and Szpak-
owicz (2004) have introduced a similarity measure 
derived from path length, which assigns scores 
ranging from a maximum of 16 to most semanti-
cally related words to a minimum of 0 to least 
related words. They have shown that on semantic 
similarity tests this measure outperforms several 
other methods. 
To build a lexicon of emotion-related words utiliz-
ing Roget?s structure, we need first to make two 
decisions: select a primary set of emotion words 
starting with which we can extract other similar

words, and choose an appropriate similarity score 
to serve as cutoff for determining semantic relat-
edness between words. 
The primary set of words that we selected con-
sists of one word for each emotion category, repre-
senting the base form of the name of the category: 
{happy, sad, anger, disgust, surprise, fear}. 
Experiments performed on Miller and Charles 
similarity data (1991), reported in Jarmasz and 
Szpakowicz (2004), have shown that pairs of 
words with a semantic similarity value of 16 have 
high similarity, while those with a score of 12 to 
14 have intermediate similarity. Therefore, we se-
lect the score of 12 as cutoff, and include in the 
lexicon all words that have similarity scores of 12 
or higher with respect to the words in the primary 
set. This selection of cutoff therefore serves as a 
form of feature selection. In Table 3, we present 
sample words from the lexicon with similarity 
scores of 16, 14, and 12 for each emotion category. 
These words represent three different levels of re-
latedness to each emotion category. We are able to 
identify a large variety of emotion-related words 
belonging to different parts of speech that go well 
beyond the stereotypical words associated with 
different emotions. We particularly note some ge-
neric neutral words, such as ?feel?, ?life?, and 
?times? associated with many emotion categories, 
indicating their conceptual relevance to emotions.

We used lists of words extracted from it for each of 
the six emotion categories. 
6 Experiments and Results 
We train classifiers with unigram features for each 
emotion class using Support Vector Machine 
(SVM) for predicting the emotion category of the 
sentences in our corpus. SVM has been shown to 
be useful for text classification tasks (Joachims, 
1998), and has previously given good performance 
in sentiment classification experiments (Kennedy 
and Inkpen, 2006; Mullen and Collier, 2004; Pang 
and Lee, 2004; Pang et al, 2002). In Table 4, we 
report results from ten-fold cross-validation ex-
periments conducted using the SMO implementa-
tion of SVM in Weka (Witten and Frank, 2005). In 
each experiment, we represent a sentence by a vec-
tor indicating the number of times each feature oc-
curs. 
In the first experiment, we use only corpus-
based unigram features. We obtain high precision 
values for all emotion classes (as shown in Table 
4), and the recall and F-measure values surpass 
baseline values for all classes except no-emotion. 
This validates our premise that unigrams can help 
learn lexical distributions well to accurately predict 
emotion categories. 
Next, we use as features all words in the emo-
tion lexicon acquired from Roget?s Thesaurus 
(RT). The F-measure scores beat the baseline for 
four out of seven classes. When we combine both 
corpus-based unigrams with RT features, we can 
increase recall values across all seven classes. 
Finally, we add features from WordNet-Affect 
to the feature set containing corpus unigrams and 
RT features. This leads to further improvement in 
overall performance. Combining all features, we 
achieve highest recall values across all but one 
class. The resulting F-measure values (ranging 
from 0.493 to 0.751) surpass the baseline values 
across all seven classes. This increase was found to 
be statistically significant (paired t-test, p=0.05). 
7 Discussion 
We observe that corpus-based features and emo-
tion-related features together contribute to im-
proved performance, better than given by any one 
type of feature group alone. 
Any automatic way of recognizing emotion 
should inevitably take into account a wide variety 
of words that are semantically connected to emo-
tions. While some words are obviously affective, 
many more are only potentially affective. The lat-
ter derive their affective property from their asso-
ciations with emotional concepts. For instance, 
words like ?family?, ?friends?, ?home? are not in-
herently emotional, but because of their well-
known semantic association with emotion con-
cepts, their presence in a sentence can be taken as 
an indicator of emotion expression in the sentence. 
We can interpret the results as indicators of how 
much correlation the classifiers can find between 
the features and the predicted class. Considering 
our best results using all features, we find that this 
correlation is highest for the ?happy? class, indi-
cated by a precision of 0.813 and recall of 0.698, 
the highest among all classes. We can therefore 
conclude that it is easier to discern happiness in 
text than Ekman?s other basic emotions.  
8 Conclusions 
Working on a corpus of blog sentences anno-
tated with emotion labels, we were able to demon-
strate that a combination of corpus-based unigram 
features and features derived from emotion lexi-
cons can help automatically distinguish basic emo-
tion categories in written text. When used together 
in an SVM-based learning environment, these fea-
tures increased recall in all cases and the resulting 
F-measure values significantly surpassed the base-
line scores for all emotion categories. 
In addition, we described a method of building 
an emotion lexicon derived from Roget?s Thesau-
rus on the basis of semantic relatedness of words 
to a set of basic emotion words for each emotion 
category. The effectiveness of this emotion lexicon 
was demonstrated in the emotion classification 
tasks.
