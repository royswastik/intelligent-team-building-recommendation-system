Abstract
The problem of identifying good features
for improving conventional language mod-
els like trigrams is presented as a classifica-
tion task in this paper. The idea is to use
various syntactic and semantic features ex-
tracted from a language for classifying be-
tween real-world articles and articles gener-
ated by sampling a trigram language model.
In doing so, a good accuracy obtained on the
classification task implies that the extracted
features capture those aspects of the lan-
guage that a trigram model may not. Such
features can be used to improve the exist-
ing trigram language models. We describe
the results of our experiments on the classi-
fication task performed on a Broadcast News
Corpus and discuss their effects on language
modeling in general.
1 Introduction
Statistical Language Modeling techniques attempt
to model language as a probability distribution
of its components like words, phrases and topics.
Language models find applications in classification
tasks like Speech Recognition, Handwriting Recog-
nition and Text Categorization among others. Con-
ventional language models based on n-grams ap-
proximate the probability distribution of a language
by computing probabilities of words conditioned on
previous n words as follows
P (s) ?
m?
i=1
p(wi|wi?n+1, . . . , wi?1) (1)
In most applications, lower order n-grams (such as
bigram or trigram) are used but they are an unre-
alistic approximation of the underlying language.
Higher order n-grams are desirable but they present
problems concerning data sparsity. On the other
hand, low order n-grams are incapable of represent-
ing other aspects of the language like the underlying
topics, topical redundancy etc. In order to build a
better language model, additional features have to
be augmented to the existing language model (e.g.
a trigram model) which capture those aspects of the
language that the trigram model does not. Now, one
way to test the goodness of a feature under consider-
ation is to use it in a framework like an exponential
model (Rosenfeld, 1997; Cai et al, 2000) and note
the improvement in perplexity. An alternative way
(Eneva et al, 2001) is as follows: Let L be the lan-
guage and L? be an approximation of the language
obtained by sampling the trigram language model.
Also, let X be a piece of text obtained from either L
or L?. Let y = h(f(X)) such that y = 1 if X ? L
and y = 0 if X ? L? where f(.) is the computed fea-
ture and h(.) is the hypothesis function (a classifier
like AdaBoost, SVM etc). If Pr[y = h(f(x))] is
found to be sufficiently high, it means that the fea-
ture f(x) is able to distinguish effectively between
the actual language L and the approximate language
L?. In other words, f(x) captures those features of
the language that are complementary to the ones
captured by the trigram model and therefore f(x)
is a good feature to augment the trigram language
model with.
The formalism explained previously can be inter-
preted as a classification task in-order to distinguish
817
between Real articles and Fake articles. Articles of
different lengths drawn at random from the Broad-
cast News Corpus (BNC)1 are termed as Real arti-
cles (from language L). Articles generated by sam-
pling the trigram model trained on the same corpus
are termed as Fake articles (language L?). These arti-
cles together form the training data for the classifier
to associate the features with the classification labels
(real or fake) where the features are computed from
the text. The features that give high classification ac-
curacy on the test set of articles are considered good
candidates for adding to the trigram model. Further-
more, the confidence that the classifier attaches to
a classification decision can be used to compute the
perplexity.
In this paper, a classification-task based formal-
ism is used to investigate the goodness of some new
features for language modeling. At the same time
features proposed in the previous literature on lan-
guage modeling are also revisited (Cai et al, 2000)
Section 2 discusses various syntactic and semantic
features used for the classification task, Section 3
gives details about the experiments conducted and
the classification results obtained and finally, Sec-
tion 4 concludes the paper by discussing the implica-
tions of the classification results on language model-
ing with pointers to improvements and future work.
2 Feature Engineering
To differentiate a real article from a fake one, the
empirical, syntactic and semantic characteristics of
a given article are used to compute the features for
the classification task. The various types of features
that were experimented are as follows:
2.1 Empirical Features
Empirical features are based on the statistical anal-
ysis of both the real and fake articles. They include
the count of uncommon pairs of words within an ar-
ticle, the ratio of perplexity of trigram and quadgram
models for a given article and the nature of the POS
tags that occur at the start and end of sentences in an
article.

100MW.txt.gz
Ratio of Perplexity of trigram and quad-gram
models
Given an article, the ratio of its perplexity for a tri-
gram model to a quad-gram model is computed. The
trigram and quad-gram models are both trained on
the same BNC corpus. Both real and fake articles
would give a low perplexity score for the tri-gram
model but for the quad-gram model, real articles
would have significantly lower perplexity than the
fake articles. This implies that the ratio of trigram
to quad-gram perplexities would be lower for a fake
article than for a real article. In other words, this ra-
tio is similar to computing the likelihood ratio of an
article w.r.t the trigram and quad-gram models. The
histogram in Figure 1 shows a good separation in
the distribution of values of this feature for the real
and fake articles which indicates the effectiveness of
this feature. A quadgram language model is a better
approximation of real text than a trigram model and
by using this as a feature, we are able to demonstrate
the usefulness of the classification task as a method
for identifying good features for language modeling.
In the subsequent sections, we investigate other fea-
tures using this classification framework.

respect to Trigram and Quadgram Language models
over the training set
Count of uncommon pairs of words
Content words are the frequently occurring words in
the corpus excluding the stop-words. All the words
in corpus are ranked according to frequency of their
occurrence and content words are defined to be the
words with rank between 150 and 6500. A list of
common content word pairs (pairs of content words
818
atleast 5 words apart) is prepared from the real cor-
pus by sorting the list of content word pairs by their
frequency of occurrence and retaining those above a
certain threshold. For a given article, a list of content
word pairs is compared against this list and word
pairs not in this list form the set of uncommon word
pairs.
A real article is expected to have lesser num-
ber of uncommon content-word pairs than fake arti-
cles. When normalized by the total number of word
pairs, we get the probability of finding an uncom-
mon content-word pair in an article. This probabil-
ity is greater for fake articles than the real articles
and we use this probability as a feature for the clas-
sification task.
Start and End POS Tags
Certain POS tags are more probable than others to
appear at the beginning or end of a real sentence.
This characteristic of real text could be used as a
feature to distinguish real articles from fake. The
distribution of POS tags of the first and last words of
the sentences in an article is used as a feature. Our
experiments show that this feature had very little ef-
fect in the overall contribution to the classification
accuracy over the development set.
2.2 Syntactic Features
These features are derived from the parse struc-
ture of the sentence. It is hypothesized that real
sentences tend to be grammatical while the same
may not be the case for fake sentences. An objec-
tive measure of the grammaticality of a sentence
can be obtained by running it through a statisti-
cal parser. The log-likelihood score returned by
the parser can be used to judge the grammatical-
ity of a sentence and thus determine whether it
is fake or real. The Charniak Parser (Charniak,
2001; Charniak, 2005) was used for assessing the
grammaticality of the articles under test. Given
an article containing sentences S1, S2, . . . , SN with
lengths L1, L2, . . . , LN , we compute the parser log-
likelihood scores P (S1), P (S2), . . . , P (SN ). The
overall grammaticality score for an article is given
by
PGram =
?N
i=1 LiP (Si)?N
i=1 Li
(2)
The grammaticality score was normalized using the
average and standard deviation over the entire train-
ing set. This feature gave small improvement in
terms of classification accuracy. There may be sev-
eral reasons for this: (1) Our training data consisted
of spoken transcripts from a broadcast news corpus
whereas the Charniak Parser was trained on a differ-
ent domain (Wall Street Journal) and (2) The parser
was trained on mixed case text where as the data we
used was all upper case.
2.3 Semantic Features
Real articles contain sentences with correlated pairs
of content-words and sentences that are correlated
with each other. An article with such sentence/word
correlations is said to be semantically coherent. Ow-
ing to the use of only the short term word history for
computing the probability distribution of a language,
a trigram model fails to model semantic coherence
and we exploit this fact for the classification task.
Specifically, we intend to model both intra-sentence
and inter-sentence semantic coherence and use them
as features for classification.
Intra-sentence Coherence
To model the intra-sentence word correlations, we
use Yule?s Q-statistic (Eneva et al, 2001). The word
correlations are learned from the BNC corpus as
well as the fake corpus. The coherence score for
an article is defined as the sum of the correlations
between pairs of content words present in the arti-
cle. The coherence score for an article is normalized
by the total number of content-word pairs found in
the article. Since the trigram and quad-gram lan-
guage model can capture short distance coherences
well, coherences between distant words can be used
to differentiate between real and fake articles. The
Yule Q-statistic is calculated for every pair of con-
tent words, which are atleast 5 words apart within a
sentence, both in the real and fake corpus.
The articles are scored according to content word-
pair correlations learned from the real as well as
fake corpus. Each article is given two scores, one
for the word-pair correlations from real articles and
other for the word-pair correlations from fake arti-
cles. For a real article, the real word-pair correla-
tion score would be relatively higher compared to
the fake word-pair correlation score (and vice-versa
819
for a fake article).
Modeling Topical Redundancy (Inter-sentence
Coherence)
A characteristic of real articles is that they tend to
be cohesive in terms of the topic under discussion.
For example, a news-article about a particular event
(topic) would have several direct or indirect refer-
ences to the event. We interpret this as some sort
of a redundancy in terms of the information con-
tent which we term as Topical Redundancy. The
fake articles would not exhibit such a redundancy.
If a real article is transformed to another represen-
tation space where some form of truncation is ap-
plied, on transformation back to the original space,
the amount of information-loss may not be signif-
icant due to information redundancy. However, if
the same process is applied on a fake article, the
information-loss would be significant when trans-
formed back to the original space. We intend to ex-
ploit this fact for our classification task.
Let DW?N be an article represented in the form
of a matrix, where W is the article vocabulary and N
is the number of sentences in that article. Every term
of this matrix represents the frequency of occurrence
of a vocabulary word in a particular sentence. We
construct a sentence-sentence matrix as follows:
A = DTD (3)
We now transform A into the Eigen-space using Sin-
gular Value Decomposition (SVD) which gives
A = USUT (4)
Here, UN?N is the eigen-vector matrix and SN?N
is the diagonal eigen-value matrix. If we retain only
the top K eigen-values from S , we get the truncated
(lossy) form S?K?K . Thus the truncated form of A
i.e. A? is
A? = US?UT (5)
We believe that the information loss ? A?A? ?2
will not be significant in the case of real articles
since the topical redundancy is captured in a very
compact manner by the eigen-representation. How-
ever, in the case of a fake article, the loss is con-
siderable. For a real article, the matrix would be
less sparse than a fake article and so is the case for
the reconstructed matrix. Therefore, the statistics -
mean, median, minimum and maximum computed
from the reconstructed matrix have higher values for
real articles than a fake articles. We use these statis-
tics as features for classifying the article. Figure 2
show the histograms of the statistics computed from
the reconstructed matrix for the training set. As can
be seen, there is a good separation between the two
classes fake and real in all the cases. Using these
features increased the classification accuracy by a
significant amount as shown later. From another per-
spective, these features model the inter-sentence se-
mantic coherence (Deerwester et al, 1990) within an
article and this is consistent with our notion of topi-
cal redundancy as explained previously. The matrix
package developed by NIST (Hicklin et al, 2005)
was used for SVD.
3 Experimental Results
3.1 Data Distribution
The training data consisted of 1000 articles (500 real
and 500 fake) obtained from Broadcast News Cor-
pus (BNC) and the test set consisted of 200 articles
(100 real and 100 fake). Additionally, a develop-
ment dataset consisting of 200 articles and having
the same distribution as that of the test dataset was
used for tuning the parameters of the classifiers. To
ensure that the training and test data come from the
same article length distribution, the training data was
resampled to have the same percentage of articles of
a given length as in the test set. The article length
distribution for both the training(resampled) and test
datasets is shown in Tables 1 and 2.
3.2 Classifier
Classifiers like AdaBoost (Freund et al, 1999) and
Max-Entropy (Rosenfeld, 1997) models were used
for the classification task.
The number of iterations for AdaBoost was esti-
mated using 5-fold cross-validation. Given a sub-
set of features, Maxent classified 74.5% of the doc-
uments correctly compared to 82% for AdaBoost.
Therefore, Adaboost was chosen as the classifier for
further experiments.

values for the fake articles are close to zero and hence cannot be seen clearly.
3.3 Results and Discussion
We used two performance measures to evaluate our
model. First is the accuracy which measures the
number of articles correctly classified as real or fake
and the second measure is the log-probability that
the model assigns to the classification decision i.e. it
measures the confidence the model has in its classi-
fication. Table 3 shows our experimental results on
the syntactic, semantic and empirical features.
The combination of syntactic, semantic and em-
pirical features gave an accuracy of 91.5% with an
average log-likelihood of -0.22 on development data
set. The accuracy on the test dataset was 87% with
an average log-likelihood of -0.328.
4 Conclusions and Future Work
In this work, we have used a classification-task
based formalism for evaluating various syntactic,
semantic and empirical features with the objective
of improving conventional language models. Fea-
tures that perform well in the task of classifying
real and trigram-generated fake articles are useful
for augmenting the trigram model. Semantic fea-
tures, such as topical redundancy, model long-range
dependencies which are not captured by a trigram
language model. Therefore, the semantic features
contribute significantly to the classification task ac-
curacy. Additionally, linguistic resources such as
WordNet (WordNet, 1998) can be used to model
