Abstract. Temporal information is useful in many NLP applications, such as 
information extraction, question answering and summarization. In this paper, 
we present a temporal parser for extracting and normalizing temporal expres-
sions from Chinese texts. An integrated temporal framework is proposed, which 
includes basic temporal concepts and the classification of temporal expressions. 
The identification of temporal expressions is fulfilled by powerful chart-parsing 
based on grammar rules and constraint rules. We evaluated the system on a sub-
stantial corpus and obtained promising results.  
1   Introduction 
Temporal information processing is valuable in many NLP applications, such as in-
formation extraction, machine translation, question-answering and multi-document 
summarization. However, a wide scope of linguistic means, from lexical to syntactic 
phenomena, can represent this information. It is hard to catch the internal temporal 
meanings which are behind surface texts. The potential applications and the flexibil-
ities of temporal representations motivate our research in this direction. 
In this paper, temporal information is defined as the knowledge about time or dura-
tion. This information is crucial for both temporal reasoning and anchoring events on 
the time line. Temporal expressions are defined as chunks of text which convey direct 
or indirect temporal information. TIMEX2 annotating guidelines [4, 6] give good 
descriptions about temporal expressions. According to the guidelines, temporal ex-
pressions include dates, times of day, durations, set-denoting expressions, event-
anchored expressions, and so on. To retrieve the useful temporal information con-
tained in these temporal expressions, we need to identify the extents of temporal ex-
pressions in raw text and then represent temporal information according to some stan-
dard. The two tasks are called temporal extraction and temporal normalization, re-
spectively. We have implemented a full system CTEMP, which consists of two mod-
ules: extractor and normalizer. The two modules fulfill temporal extraction and tem-
poral normalization, respectively. 
A comprehensive temporal framework is investigated to analyze the elements in-
volved in the mapping procedure, from surface text to internal temporal information. 
This framework includes basic temporal objects and relations, the measurement of 
time, and the classification of temporal expressions from Chinese texts. To cope with 
 CTEMP: A Chinese Temporal Parser 695 
 
the flexibilities of the temporal expressions, we have built the temporal parser based 
on chart-parsing and effective constraints. Experiments with respect to a substantial 
corpus show that the temporal parser achieves promising results. We took part in 
TERN 2004 Chinese temporal expression extraction with this temporal parser and our 
performance is the highest in that track.  
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we give a brief discus-
sion on related works; Section 3 describes the temporal framework, which is the basis 
of the whole temporal parser; extractor and normalizer of the temporal parser are 
discussed in Section 4 and Section 5, respectively; Section 6 gives the description 
about experiments and evaluations. Finally, conclusion and future work are presented 
in Section 7. 
2   Related Work 
Motivated by the potential applications, temporal information processing has ab-
sorbed more attention recently than ever, such as ACL 2001 workshop on temporal 
and spatial information processing, LREC 2002 and TERN 2004 [14]. Mani [10] 
gives a good review about the recent trend. Research works in this area can be classi-
fied into four types: designing annotation scheme for temporal information represen-
tation [4, 6, 12]; developing temporal ontology which covers temporal objects and 
their relationships between each other [2, 7]; Identifying time-stamps of events or 
temporal relationships between events [5, 9]; Identifying and normalizing temporal 
expressions from different languages [1, 3, 8, 11, 13, 15].  
Temporal annotation, temporal ontology and temporal reasoning are not the fo-
cuses in this paper. Among the research works on temporal expression extraction and 
normalization, most of them are based on hand-written rules or machine-learnt rules. 
Mani and Wilson [11] resolve temporal expressions by hand-crafted and machine-
learnt rules. Their focus is resolving temporal expressions, especially indexical ex-
pressions, which designate times that are dependent on the speaker and some refer-
ence time. We concentrate on the procedure of extraction and normalization, and try 
to cover more temporal expressions. Schilder and Habel [13] employ several finite 
state transducers based on hand-written rules to extract and normalize time-denoting 
and event-denoting temporal expressions. Evaluation of the system is presented on a 
small corpus. 
 Vazov [15] identifies temporal expressions based on context constraints and regu-
lar expressions, but temporal expression normalization is not investigated. Estela et al 
[3] present a temporal parser on Spanish based on grammar rules and evaluate the 
tagger on a small corpus. Jang [8] reports a time tagger for Korean based on a human-
edited, automatically-derived dictionary of patterns. The dictionary is induced from 
training data and is used to extract and normalize temporal expressions in texts. Ahn 
et al [1] adopt the task of TERN 2004 evaluation and investigate machine learning 
methods for extraction of temporal expression and rule based methods for normaliza-
tion. However, they focus on Korean and English text respectively and may not con-
sider some characteristics of Chinese language.

3   Temporal Framework 
The goal of the temporal parser is to extract and normalize temporal expressions. First 
we should realize the elements involved in this procedure. We propose a temporal 
framework to describe temporal concepts, the measurement and all kinds of temporal 
expressions in the surface text. Our temporal parser is based on this comprehensive 
framework. 
3.1   Basic Objects and Relations 
In the field of time, basic objects are just time and durations. Time is a point or inter-
val on the time line. Given the origin and a measurement, it can be evaluated with a 
real number. If there is no extra specification in Chinese text, the calendar is the Gre-
gorian calendar. Duration is the distance between some two times. We can anchor 
duration by the start time and the end time, or by one of them and the length of the 
duration. However, if duration is referred to just length, it cannot be anchored on the 
time line. In temporal field, relations between objects are also defined. Between two 
times, relations are ?before?, ?same?, ?include?, ?after?. These objects and relation-
ships are internal concepts behind surface text and we hope to fetch them.   
3.2 The Measurement  
To represent lengths on the time line, a measurement should be given. The temporal 
units consist of two types, macro units and micro units, shown in Fig. 1. To represent 
a time, the scope of the numbers which can be combined with temporal units is lim-
ited. ?Century? and ?Year? are two special time units, because only these two time 
units can help to anchor a time concept on the time line. If there is no help from con-
texts, other time units can not anchor a time concept on the time line. These limita-
tions are valuable in normalization of temporal expression.

3.3   Representation in Chinese Text  
According to our observation on Chinese texts and the annotation standards of 
TIMEX2 [4, 6] and TIMEX3 [12], temporal expressions can be classified into differ-
ent classes. They are shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2. The classification of temporal expression 
In Chinese, if people do not know the exact number at an inferior time level, they 
may append an imprecise description to denote a position in a larger scope, such as 
?????/the spring of last year?. We named these temporal expressions ?PosDate?. 
These expressions consist of date expressions and imprecise appendix.  
?TempWord? expressions are some Chinese words which contained temporal 
meanings, such as ???/the lunar new year?, ???/now?. ?Composite? expressions 
include basic temporal expressions, calculated expressions and special expressions, 
such as ?1999?4?28?/April 28, 1999?, and ????/after two years? and ?1999 
?? / the fiscal year 1999?. ?Set? expressions denote a set of time and most of them 
are about frequency, such as ???/every year? and ????/every two days?. ?Even-
tAn? expressions are relevant to the times of events, such as ??????/when he 
was speaking?. ?EventAn? expressions can be anchored on the time line only after the 
times of the events are resolved.  
4   Extractor Based on Grammar and Constraints 
The task of extractor is to identify the extents of temporal expressions in the surface 
text. A set of context free grammar rules is designed to describe the basic form of all 
kinds of temporal expressions and a bottom-up chart parser is employed to parse tem-
poral expressions. Word segmentation is a preliminary step in many Chinese NLP 
applications. However, the performance of word segmentation is not perfect and it 
may introduce some extra errors. In our system, each possible combination of Chinese 
characters in a sentence will be looked up, and then all of the constituents are fed into 
the char parser. If the dictionaries are comprehensive enough, then all the possible 
explanations of all the possible combinations of characters can be gotten. Ambiguities 
and overlaps between multiple temporal expressions are left to constraint rules and 
combination rules. 
4.1   Temporal Grammar Rules 
A set of grammar rules is designed for each type of temporal expressions. In order to 
catch more temporal expressions, the grammar rules are given loosely. Some pseudo 
temporal expressions may be introduced and this problem is addressed in the next 
698 M. Wu et al 
 
section.Given these grammar rules, ?15?24?/15:24? and ?15?24?39?/15:24:39? 
can be recognized. In these examples, ??/o?clock?, ??/minute?, ??/second? are all 
constituents of the type ?Time_Unit?. 
Table 1. Grammar rules for DayTime expressions 
No.1.   Exp -> Time_Of_Day 
No.2.   Time_Of_Day -> Time_Base 
No.3.   Time_Base -> Time_Temp + 
No.4.   Time_Temp -> Integer Time_Unit 
     No.5.    Integer -> Digit + 
4.2   Constraint Rules 
There are many complex and variable phenomena in natural language. Even the domain 
is narrowed down to the temporal field, grammar rules are not enough to extract exact 
temporal expressions. There are some pseudo expressions which satisfy grammar rules, 
so constraint rules are designed to specify the true temporal expressions according to the 
context. These constraint rules are developed by analyzing thedata set. 
A constraint rule will be triggered after the right part of the corresponding grammar 
rule is satisfied. If the constraint rule is satisfied, then the grammar rule can be applied; 
otherwise, it cannot be applied. Examples of constraint rules are shown in Table 2 and 
the following two examples show the constraint checking procedure step by step. 
Table 2.  Examples of constraint rules 
Grammar   rule 3:   Time_Base -> Time_Temp + 
Constraint  rule 3:   IF There is only one constituent of the type ?Time_Temp?,  
                                THEN the constituent ?Time_Unit? which is contained in  
                                ?Time_Temp?, should not be ??/ minute?.   
 
Grammar  rule 4:    Time_Temp -> Integer Time_Unit 
Constraint rule 4:    The constituent ?Integer? can not end up with ??/ (a quanti 
                                fier)?.

            Fail and then terminate parsing.

Step 1. Look up dictionary.

            [7/Integer] [?/Time_Unit] [30/Integer][?/Time_Unit] 
Step  3. Check constraint rule No.4. 
             Pass. 
Step  4. Apply grammar rule No.4. 
        [7?/Time_Temp] [30?/Time_Temp] 
Step  5. Check constraint rule No.3. 
             Pass. 
Step  6. Apply grammar rule No.3. 
             [7?30?/Time_Base] 
Step  7. Apply grammar rule No.2. 
             [7?30?/Time_Of_Day] 
Step  8. Apply grammar rule No.1. 
             [7?30?/Exp] 
Step  9. Recognize the temporal expression successfully. 
In the first example ???/very? is an adverb and has no temporal meaning. How-
ever the character ??/ten? and ??/minute? can be looked up and satisfy the grammar 
rule. Constraint rules are necessary to filter the pseudo expression. 
4.3   Combination of Temporal Expressions 
Because each possible substring in a sentence is tried, multiple nested, overlap or 
adjacent temporal expressions may exist in the sentence. However, some of these 
expressions are just parts of the optimal answers. So combination is necessary to get 
the integrated temporal expression. After applying grammar rules, if any two temporal 
expressions are nested, overlapped or adjacent, our system will combine them and 
keep the final result. This procedure is shown by the following examples. 
(3) ??????????????? 
     (This train will arrive at Nan Chang next morning.) 
First recognized temporal expressions are [??/tomorrow] and [??/morning]. 
After the combination, the correct answer [????/next morning] will appear. 
(4) ??8???????? 
     (The basketball game starts at 8:00 p.m.) 
First recognized expressions are [??/night], [8?/8:00], [??8?/8:00 p.m.]. 
The final result is [??8?/ 8:00 p.m.]. 
4.4   Temporal/Non-temporal Disambiguation 
Some strings of characters are temporal expressions in given contexts, but in other 
contexts they are not. The context should be browsed to extract the true temporal 
expressions. Some constraint rules are designed to check the context and fulfill dis-
ambiguation. Three kinds of ambiguities are founded. The first kind is the ambiguities 
700 M. Wu et al 
 
caused by numbers, such as example 5. In this case, the expression ?15?10? contains 
temporal information, but in sports news messages it may be a score of a game. The 
second kind is the ambiguities caused by the combination of numbers and time units, 
such as ????. In example 6, the expression ???? just refers to a football team 
member. However, in many news messages it is a date. The third kind is the ambigui-
ties caused by Chinese words, such as ???. In example 7, the expression means ?for-
mer? and its explanations in other contexts may be ?in front of?. 
(5) ??????15?10?????? 
(6) ??6????10????????????? 
(7) ???????????????????????? 
There are multiple explanations for the same one phrase or word, so ambiguities 
may be caused. To discriminate these expressions, heuristics for disambiguation are 
embedded in corresponding constraint rules.  
5   Normalizer Based on Mapping Procedure 
The goal of normalizer is to represent the temporal information of contained in tem-
poral expressions, according to some standard. The normalizer is based on the map-
ping procedure, in which temporal expressions are explained and represented by val-
ues of temporal attributes. In this procedure, the objects number, unit, time and dura-
tion are employed to store and represent temporal information.  
5.1   Introduction to Normalization 
TERN 2004 evaluation [14] is a public evaluation on the extraction and normalization 
of temporal expressions. To evaluate our temporal parser in a real task, we express 
temporal information according to the standard of TERN 2004 evaluation. Any tem-
poral expression will be explained by a possible combination of the values of the six 
attributes. These attributes are described in table 3. 
Table 3. Temporal attributes 
Attribute Function 
VAL Contains the value of a time or duration 
MOD Captures temporal modifications 
SET Designates set-denoting expressions 
ANCHOR_VAL Contains a normalized form of the reference time 
ANCHOR_DIR Capture the relative direction/orientation between VAL 
and ANCHOR_VAL 
NON_SPECIFIC Designates a generic, essensially nonreferencial expression 
5.2   Normalization of Temporal Expressions 
After the procedure of extraction, the chart parser keeps all the applied grammar rules 
and recognized intermediate constituents. Semantic meanings of temporal expressions 
 CTEMP: A Chinese Temporal Parser 701 
 
can be achieved by the explanation of these grammar rules. In this procedure, some 
basic objects, such as ?number?, ?unit?, ?time? and ?duration?, can be employed to 
store and convey temporal information. Applying grammar rules means creations or 
updates of basic temporal objects. Based on our temporal framework, we explain how 
to normalize the temporal expression extracted, i.e. mapping the expressions to the 
values of six attributes. The mapping procedure is different for different kinds of 
temporal expressions. A general description about the mapping procedure is shown in   
Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. Mapping temporal expressions to attributes 
According to the classification scheme in Section 3.3, all temporal expressions can 
be mapped to the six attributes. The mapping procedures are complicated and selected 
examples are shown in Table 4. It is difficult to tell whether a temporal expression is 
?specific? or not, and few expressions are set a value at this attribute, we do not map 
expression to the attribute ?NON_SPECIFIC?. 
Table 4. Examples of normalization 
Expressions Attributes 
??/now 
val="PRESENT_REF"  
anchor_val="2000-10-05" anchor_dir="AS_OF" 
??8?20?/20: 20 p.m. val="1999-04-26 T20:20" 
???/the next two years val="P2Y"  
anchor_val="2000" anchor_dir="STARTING" 
???/every two days val="P2D" set="YES" 
????/ next afternoon val="2000-10-07TAF" 
?MOD? attribute of temporal expressions may be set as ?YES? if there are some 
modifying descriptions about the expressions, such as ???/about?, ???/before? 
and so on. So any kind of temporal expressions may be mapped on this attribute. 
?Set? expressions can be explained as set of times, such as ???/each year?, or set of 
durations, such as ????/every two years?, so the attributes ?VAL? and ?SET? will 
be filled. ?ANCHOR_VAL? and ?ANCHOR_DIR? refer to reference times and we 
702 M. Wu et al 
 
adopt the publishing times of news articles as the default reference times. Event ex-
pressions are relevant with a specific event and it is hard to represent the exact mean-
ing of them. In our system event expressions are not normalized.  
5.3   Time/Duration Disambiguation 
Sometimes people omit a part of a full temporal expression for convenience in Chi-
nese texts. For example, ?4?/April? and ?97?/ ?97? are used to instead ?2000?4?
/April, 2000? and ?1997?/the year 1997?. However, ?4?/four months? and ?97?
/97 years? are also legal temporal expressions. These temporal expressions are com-
binations of numbers and common time units. The first kind of explanations means 
these expressions are times and the second kind of explanations means they are dura-
tions. To get the correct values of temporal attributes for these temporal expressions, 
disambiguation is necessary. Heuristic rules are employed for disambiguation, which 
are shown in Table 5.   
Table 5.  Some heuristic rules for disambiguation 
IF a 3-digit or four-digit number is combined with the unit ??/year?, THEN this 
expression is time;  
IF a 2-digit number is combined with the unit ??/year? and the number is bigger 
that 70, THEN this expression is time. 
IF a 1-digit number is combined with the unit ??/year?,  THEN this expression is 
duration. 
6   Evaluation and Analysis 
In this section we report the results about evaluating our temporal parser on a manu-
ally annotated corpus, which consist of 457 Chinese news articles. The data collection 
contains 285,746 characters/142,872 words and 4,290 manually annotated temporal 
expressions. We will evaluate the boundaries of expressions and the values of the six 
temporal attributes.  
Table 6. Experiment configuration 
Experiment No. Conditions 
1 No constraints, combination of nested expressions 
2 No constraints, combination of nested, overlapped and 
adjacent expressions 
3 Constraints, combination of nested expressions 
4 Constraints, combination of nested, overlapped and adja-
cent expressions 
In our temporal parser, we embedded constraints to restrict grammar rules. In addi-
tion, we combine the nested, overlapped and adjacent temporal expressions. In Chi-
nese, many temporal expressions contain nested temporal expressions. If we do not 
 CTEMP: A Chinese Temporal Parser 703 
 
combine these nested components into the optimal answer, there will be so many 
mismatched expressions. So the combination of nested temporal expressions is neces-
sary. In the experiments, we try to evaluate two factors: the constraint rules, and the 
combination of overlapped and adjacent temporal expressions. Four experiments are 
set up, which are described in Table 6. Given these conditions, the results of the ex-
periments are shown in Table 7.

Several related works are designed to extract and normalize temporal expressions, 
however they are about English, Spanish, French, Korea and so on. We take part in 
TERN 2004 evaluation on Chinese temporal expression extraction and achieve the 
highest performance in this task. There is no public result on Chinese temporal ex-
pression normalization, for reference we compare our normalization result of Experi-
ment NO. 4 with the English normalization result in TERN 2004. Our performance is 
medium among their results.  
Table 7 compares the Precision, Recall and F-measure for different attributes in 
different experiments. ?TEXT? means the performance of exact boundaries of tempo-
ral expressions and other attributes are explained in Section 5.1. For attributes 
?TEXT? and ?VAL?, we achieve the highest performance in Experiment 4. The F-
scores are 0.849 and 0.768, respectively. For other attributes, we also achieved nearly 
highest score in Experiment 4. From the trend of performance on these two attributes, 
we can see the constraints and the procedure of combination have positive effects to 
performance of the temporal parser, especially on ?TEXT? and ?VAL?. At the same 
time, the procedure of combination is not significant to other attributes. Based on the 
assumption that two adjacent or overlapped temporal expressions refer to the same 
temporal concept, we combined them. However, the procedure of combination can 
not help to explain the meaning of the expressions.    
704 M. Wu et al 
 
After the evaluation we collect the errors of Experiment NO. 4 and try to summary 
the reasons. Wrong attribute values include missed, incorrect and spurious cases. The 
reason for errors on the attributes ?ANCHOR_VAL? and ?ANCHOR_DIR? is that 
the system did not give correct reference times. Table 8 gives the error distributions 
according to different attributes. From this table, it can be seen that temporal Chinese 
words and events are difficult to extract and normalize.

7   Conclusion 
In this paper, we present the temporal parser that extract and normalize comprehen-
sive temporal expressions from Chinese texts. We also propose a temporal frame-
work, which include basic temporal objects and relations, the measurement and classi-
fication of temporal expressions. To cope with kinds of temporal expressions, con-
straint rules are employed to retrieve genuine expressions and resolve ambiguities. 
The temporal parser CTEMP is fully implemented, which is based on the chart pars-
ing and constraint checking scheme. We have evaluated the temporal parser on a 
manually annotated corpus and achieved promising results of F-measures of 85.6% on 
extent and 76.8% on value. We took part in TERN-2004 Chinese temporal expression 
extraction with this parser and achieved the highest performance in that track.  
 CTEMP: A Chinese Temporal Parser 705 
 
In our experiments the temporal parser is also evaluated with/without constraints, 
combination of nested and overlapped temporal expressions. We find that constraints 
are significant to the task extraction and normalization. At the same time, combina-
tion has positive influence on the task extraction. Error analysis shows that temporal 
Chinese words and events are more difficult to extract and normalize. To improve the 
performance of extraction, we plan to decide whether to keep any temporal Chinese 
words as a genuine temporal expression automatically according to the contribution of 
the word. We also plan to improve the performance of normalization by more precise 
semantic explanation.
