Abstract 
Since its inception, the World Wide Web 
(WWW) has exponentially grown to shelter 
billions of monolingual and multilingual 
web pages that can be navigated through 
hyperlinks. Its structural properties provide 
useful information in presenting the socio-
linguistic properties of the web. In this 
study, about 26 million web pages under 
the South East Asian country code top-
level-domains (ccTLDs) are analyzed, sev-
eral language communities are identified, 
and the graph structure of these communi-
ties are analyzed. The distance between 
language communities are calculated by a 
distance metrics based on the number of 
outgoing links between web pages. Inter-
mediary languages are identified by graph 
analysis. By creating a language subgraph, 
the size and diameter of its strongly-
connected components are derived, as these 
values are useful parameters for language-
specific crawling. Performing a link struc-
ture analysis of the web pages can be a use-
ful tool for socio-linguistic and technical 
research purposes. 
1 Introduction 
The World Wide Web contains interlinked docu-
ments, called web pages, navigable by hyperlinks. 
Since its creation, it has grown to contain billions 
of web pages and several billion hyperlinks. These 
web pages are created by millions of people from 
all parts of the world. Each web page contains a 
large amount of information that can be shared and 
disseminated to people with Internet access. Au-
thors and creators of a web page come from differ-
ent backgrounds, different cultures, and different 
languages. Thus, a web page is a resource of multi-
lingual content, and a fertile source for socio-
linguistic analysis.  
1.1 Web Crawling 
While search-engines are important means of ac-
cessing the web for most users, automated systems 
of retrieving information from the web have been 
developed. These systems are called web crawlers, 
where a software agent is given a list of pages to 
visit. As the crawler visits these pages, it follows 
their outgoing links and adds these to the list of 
pages to visit. Each page is visited recursively ac-
cording to some sets of policies (e.g. the type of 
pages to retrieve, direction, the maximum depth 
from the URL (uniform resource locator), etc.). 
The result of this crawl is a vast amount of data, 
most of which may be irrelevant to certain indi-
viduals. Thus, a focused-crawling approach was 
implemented by some systems to limit the search 
to only a subset of the web. 
Focused crawlers rely on classifiers to work ef-
fectively. Language-specific crawlers, for example, 
need a very good language identification module 
that properly identifies the language of the web 
pages. General crawlers can be extended to include 
focused-crawling capabilities by incorporating the 
classifiers. Another important requirement to effi-
ciently crawl the desired domain is the list of initial 
web pages, called seed URLs. Each of these URLs 
will be enqueued into a list. The agent visits each 
URL in the list. Since the crawler recursively visits 
The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008
49
the outgoing links of each URL, it is possible that 
the seed URL is an outgoing link of another seed 
URL, or an outgoing link of an outgoing link of 
another seed URL. Listing these URLs as seed 
URLs will just waste the crawler?s time in visiting 
them, when they have already been visited. If sev-
eral URLs can be reached from just one URL, the 
seed URL list size will decrease and the crawler 
will be more efficient. However, the maximum 
distance between these web pages must also be 
considered, since the crawler can have a policy to 
stop the crawling after reaching a certain depth.  
1.2 The Web as Graph 
A graph consists of a set of nodes, denoted by V 
and a set of edges, denoted by E. Each edge is a 
pair of nodes (u, v) representing a connection be-
tween u and v. A path between two nodes is a se-
quence of edges that is passed through from one 
node to reach the other node. 
In a directed graph, each edge is an ordered pair 
of nodes. A path from u to v does not imply a path 
from v to u. The distance between any two nodes is 
the number of edges in a shortest path connecting 
them. The diameter of the graph is the maximum 
distance between any two nodes. 
In an undirected graph, each edge is an unor-
dered pair of nodes. There is an edge between u 
and v if there is a link between u and v, regardless 
of which node is the source of the link. 
A strongly-connected component (SCC) of a di-
rected graph is a set of nodes such that for any pair 
of nodes u and v in the set, there is a path from u to 
v. The strongly-connected components of a graph 
consist of disjoint sets of nodes. A subgraph is a 
graph whose nodes and edges are subsets of an-
other graph. 
With the interlinked nature of the web, it can be 
represented as a graph, with the web pages as the 
nodes and the edges as the hyperlinks between the 
pages.  
1.3 Languages 
Languages are expressions of individuals and 
groups of individuals, essential to all form of 
communication. It is a fundamental medium of 
expressing one?s self whether in spoken or written 
form. Ehtnologue (2005) lists 6,912 known living 
languages in the world. Only a small portion of 
these languages can be found in the web today. 
A language community in the web is the group 
of web pages written in a language. Major lan-
guage communities discovered in each country 
indicates the dominant language of the country?s 
web space. How one language community is re-
lated to another language community can be shown 
by analyzing the hyperlinks between them. Thus, a 
language graph can be created with the language 
communities as nodes, and the links between the 
language communities as edges.  
2 Previous Studies 
One of the earliest web survey in Asia (Ciolek, 
1998) presented statistical data of the Asian web 
space by using the Altavista WWW search engine 
in gathering its data. In 2001, he wrote a paper pre-
senting the trends in the volume of hyperlinks con-
necting websites in 10 Eash Asian countries. 
Several studies have also been done regarding 
the representation of the web as a graph. Kumar et 
al. (2000) showed that a graph can be induced by 
the hyperlinks between pages. Measures on the 
connected component sizes and diameter were pre-
sented to show the high-level structure of the web. 
Broder et al (2000) did experiments on the web on 
a larger scale and showed the web?s macroscopic 
structure consisting of the SCC, IN, OUT, and 
TENDRILS. Balakrishnan and Deo (2006) ob-
served that the number of edges grow superlinearly 
with the number of nodes, showing the degree dis-
tributions and diameter. Petricek et al (2006) used 
web graph structural metrics to measure properties 
such as the distance between two random pages 
and interconnectedness of e-government websites. 
Bharat et al (2001) studied the macro-structure of 
the web, showing the linkage between web sites by 
creating the ?hostgraph?, with the nodes represent-
ing the hosts and the edges as the count of hyper-
links between pages on the corresponding hosts. 
Chakrabarti et al (1999) proposed a new ap-
proach to topic-specific web resource discovery by 
creating a focused crawler that selectively retrieves 
web pages relevant to a pre-defined set of topics. 
Stamatakis et al (2003) created CROSSMARC, a 
focused web crawler that collects domain-specific 
web pages. Deligenti et al (2000) presented a fo-
cused crawling algorithm that builds a model for 
the context within which relevant pages to a topic 
occur on the web. Pingali et al (2006) created an 
Indian search engine with a language identification 
The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008
50
module that returns a language only if the number 
of words in a web page are above a given threshold 
value. The web pages were transliterated first into 
UTF-8 encoding. Tamura et al (2007) presented a 
simulation study of language specific crawling and 
proposed a method for selectively collecting web 
pages written in a specific language by doing a 
linguistic graph analysis of real web data, and then 
transforming them into variation of link selection 
strategies.  
Despite several studies on web graph and lan-
guage-specific crawling, no study has been done 
showing the ?language graph?. Herring et al 
(2007) showed a study on language networks of a 
selected web community, LiveJournal, but not on 
the web as a whole.  
3 Scope and Objectives of the Study 
This research was conducted on the 10 ccTLDs of 
the South East Asian countries. This paper, how-
ever, will only show the results for the Indonesian 
domain (.id). 
This research aims to show the socio-linguistic 
properties of the language communities in each 
country at the macroscopic level. The web page 
distribution for each language community in a 
given ccTLD and its most frequently linked to lan-
guages are shown. The distance is also computed 
and the language graph is illustrated. 
This research also aims to show the graph prop-
erties of some Filipino language communities and 
its implication for crawling. Graph properties like 
the SCC size and the diameter will be presented to 
show these characteristics in a subset of the web. 
Finally, this research demonstrates the useful-
ness of graph analysis approaches.  
4 Methodology 
This study was conducted by performing a series 
of steps from the collection of data to the presenta-
tion of the results through images.  
4.1 UbiCrawler 
UbiCrawler (Boldi et al, 2004) was used to 
download the web pages under the Asian ccTLDs. 
These pages were downloaded primarily for the 
purpose of assessing the usage level of each 
language in cyberspace, one of the objectives of 
the Language Observatory Project (LOP) 1 . The 
crawl was started on July 5, 2006, running for 14 
days. 107,168,733 web pages were collected from 
43 ccTLDs in Asia. Each page contains several 
information such as the character set and outgoing 
links. For this study, the URL of a web page and 
the URL of its outgoing links were used. Although 
there are many web pages of Asia that can be 
found in generic domains, they were not included 
in this survey to limit the volume of the crawl data.  
4.2 Language Identification 
A language identification module (LIM) developed 
for LOP based on the n-gram method (Suzuki et al, 
2002) was used to identify on what language a 
page is written in. This method first creates byte 
sequences for each training text of a language. It 
then checks the byte sequences of the web pages 
that match the byte sequences of the training texts. 
The language having the highest matching rate is 
considered as the language of the web page. The 
language identification module used the parallel 
corpus of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights (UDHR), translated into several languages. 
After crawling, LIM was executed to identify the 
languages of each downloaded web page. The 
identification result was stored in a LIM result file 
that contains the URL, the language, and matching 
rate, among others. In this study, the issues 
regarding the accuracy of LIM will not be 
discussed.  
4.3 Web Page Analysis 
For this study, the web pages of the 10 South East 
Asian ccTLDs were selected for analysis. There 
were 26,196,823 web pages downloaded under 
these ccTLDs. The web pages for each country 
were grouped by languages. The list of languages 
was narrowed down to 20 based on the number of 
pages, arranged from highest to lowest. 
The link structure can be analyzed by traversing 
the outgoing links of each web page. For each web 
page, its outgoing links are retrieved. For each out-
going link, the LIM result file is checked for its 
language. The number of outgoing links in each 
language is counted. If the URL of the outgoing 
link is not on the file, it wasn?t downloaded. There-
fore, the language of the ougoing link is unidenti-
fied. This is usually the case of outgoing links un-

der the generic TLDs (e.g., .com, .org, .gov, etc.) 
and non-Asian ccTLDs.  
4.4 Language Graph 
There is a link between two languages if there is at 
least one outgoing link from a web page in one 
language to the other language. The language 
graph is created through contraction procedure, 
where all edges linking the same language page are 
contracted.  
4.5 Language Adjacency Matrix 
Based on the number of web pages in a language 
and the number of outgoing links from one lan-
guage to another, the language adjacency table N 
for each country is created. The row and column 
headers are the same ? the top 20 languages based 
on the number of web pages. The value Nij is the 
number of outgoing links from language i to lan-
guage j. 
The language adjacency matrix P contains the 
ratio of the number of outgoing links and the total 
number of outgoing links as can be found in the 
language adjacency table. Each cell value, Pij is the 
probability that a web page in a language i has an 
outgoing link to language j. 
?=
k
ikijij NNP /  
A link from language i to language j is not nec-
essarily accompanied by a link from language j to i. 
Even if there is a link, the number of outgoing 
links is not equal. To show the relationship be-
tween two languages based on the link structure, 
the language distance is computed.  
4.6 Distance between Languages 
The distance between two languages measures 
their level of connectedness. It is the relationship 
between the number of outgoing links from lan-
guage i to language j and vice versa. The distance 
is computed as the ratio of the number of outgoing 
links between two languages and the total number 
of outgoing links of the two languages. 
The distance between language i and language j, 
Dij is, ( ) ?? ?+= ijij R1/D  where Rij is the lan-
guage link ratio is defined as,  
( ) ?
?
??
?
? ++= ??
k
jkik
k
jiijij NNNNR /   for (i ? j) 
1=ijR     for (i = j) 
where ? is an adjusting parameter introduced to 
avoid division-by-zero, which may happen when 
Rij=0, i.e. no links between two languages. We set 
?=0.0001. Thus, the maximum distance between 
languages becomes 99. ? is another adjusting pa-
rameter to make Dij as a distance metrics, and we 
set ?=1. Assumption behind this definition is based 
on commonly-observed rules in our world. It is 
widely observed that interaction between two ob-
jects is proportional to the inverse square of dis-
tance between two objects. The number of web 
links between two language communities is con-
sidered as a kind of interaction. Languages with no 
links between them have a distance of 99, and the 
distance of a language to itself is 0. 
Based on this distance metrics, the macroscopic 
language graph is created. A distance limit of 15 is 
used to clearly show which languages are closely-
related by their link structure.  
4.7 Intermediary Languages 
Considering the direction of the outgoing links, the 
possibility that language i will link to language j 
may be lesser than the possibility that language i 
will link to language j by passing through an in-
termediary language k, such that PikPkj > Pij. The 
intermediary language is identified, as this would 
mean that there are better ways to reach another 
language from one language.  
4.8 Graph Analysis using JGraphT 
JGraphT is a free Java graph library that provides 
graph objects and algorithms. The library provides 
classes that calculates and returns the strongly-
connected components subgraphs. To compute the 
distance between nodes, several graph searching 
algorithms are available, one of which is the Dijik-
stra algorithm that computes for the shortest path. 
A utility to export the graph into a format readable 
by most graph visualization tools is also available. 
A graph file, written in the DOT language (a plain 
text graph description language) was created, con-
taining the nodes and edges of language pages. 
From this, the strongly-connected components and 
its properties (i.e. size, diameter) were determined.  
4.9 GraphVis: Visualization Tool 
GraphViz is open-source graph visualization 
software that takes descriptions of graphs in a 
simple text language and makes diagrams in 
The 6th Workshop on Asian Languae Resources, 2008
52
several formats, including images. The neato 
layout, which makes ?spring model? layouts, was 
used to visualize the distance between languages. 
However, the calculated distance cannot be drawn 
exactly, and this visualization is only two-
dimensional. So, the images are distorted and do 
not illustrate the exact distance, only an 
approximation.  
5 Results 
This section shows some results on the Indonesian 
domain.  
5.1 Link Structure 
Indonesia is a country with one of the biggest lan-
guage diversity in the world. According to Eth-
nologue2, 742 languages are spoken in the country. 
But, the LIM results show that only five of these 
languages are listed in the top 10 languages in the 
country, i.e., Javanese, Indonesian, Malay, Sun-
danese, and Madurese.

5.3 Graph Properties 
This section discusses the size distribution of the 
SCCs and the diameter of the Filipino language 
community in Indonesia. 
 
SCC size 
The SCCs of a graph are those sets of nodes such 
that for every node, there is a path to all the other 
nodes. The size of each SCC refers to the number 
of nodes it contains. Distribution of the sizes of 
SCCs gives a good understanding of the graph 
structure of the web, and has important implica-
tions for crawling. If most components have large 
sizes, only a few nodes are needed as seed URLs (a 
list of starting pages for a crawler) to be able to 
reach all the other nodes. If all nodes are members 
of a single SCC, one URL is enough to crawl all 
pages.

calculated and plotted in the chart. Their corre-
sponding SCC graph is also shown. 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Diameter distribution of the Filipino 
language community in Indonesia 
 
For the Filipino language subgraph of Indonesia, 
the component with the largest node size also has 
the largest diameter. However, the largest diameter 
size is only 3, which is a very small number. Most 
of the components have a diameter of 4.  
6 Implications 
For the Filipino language community, many SCCs 
can be found in the Philippines, since Filipino is 
one of its national languages. However, for some 
countries, there are not many SCCs. For example, 
Indonesia only has 18 SCCs, half of which consist 
only of one node. However, the largest component 
size is 45, and there are 4 more large components. 
By picking out just one node from each SCC with 
a large size and using it as a seed URL, many web 
pages can already be downloaded. Add to it the 
depth parameter of 3, which is the largest diameter, 
these web pages can be downloaded within a short 
period of time. 
The choice of seed URL and the crawly depth 
are useful parameters for crawling. The analysis is 
done for each language community to get these 
parameters for language-specific crawling pur-
poses. These parameters are different for each lan-
guage community. This paper shows only shows 
the case of the Filipino language community of 
Indonesia as a sample illustration of the diameter 
metric.  
7 Conclusion 
The vastness and multilingual content of the web 
makes it a rich source of culturally-diversified in-
formation. Since web pages are connected by hy-
perlinks, information can be readily accesses by 
jumping from one page to another via the hyper-
links. 
For each country domain, the web pages written 
in the same language form a language community. 
The link structure between language communities 
shows how connected a language community is 
with another language community. It can be as-
sumed that the close links between two language 
communities on the web imply the existence of 
multilingual speakers of the two languages. Oth-
erwise linked pages will not be visited. In this con-
text, the language graph analysis demonstrated in 
this study gives an effective tool to understand the 
linguistic scenes of the country. If the same analy-
sis is performed for the secondary level domain 
data, further insight into the socio-linguistic status 
of each language can be drawn. Secondary domain 
corresponds to different social area of language 
activities, such as ?ac? or ?edu? for academic and 
education arena, ?go? or ?gov? for government or 
public arena, and ?co? or ?com? for commercial 
business and occupational arena. Although this 
study does not extend its scope to the secondary 
level domain analysis, the effectiveness of the ap-
proach was demonstrated. 
Another implication drawn from this study is 
that the language graph analysis can identify in-
termediary languages in the multilingual communi-
ties. In the real world, some languages are acting 
as a medium of communications among the differ-
ent language speakers. In most cases, such lingua 
franca are international languages such as English, 
French, Arabic, etc. But it?s difficult to identify 
which language is acting as such in detail. But on 
the web link structure among languages, the lan-
guage graph can give us a clue to identify this. As 
shown in this paper, there are a number of lan-
guages acting as intermediary between two lan-
guages having only a few hyperlinks between them. 
Although the result of this category is doubtful 
because of misidentification of language, some 
cases show the expected result. 
The second objective of the study is to give a 
microscopic level structure of the web communi-
ties for much more practical and technical reasons, 
such as how to design more effective crawling 
strategy, and how to prepare starting URLs with 
minimal efforts. The key issue in this context is to 
reveal the connectedness of the web. To show the 
connectedness of language communities, several

graph theory metrics, the size and numbers of 
strongly-connected components and the diameters 
are calculated and visual presentations of language 
communities are also given. This information can 
aid in defining parameters used for crawling, par-
ticularly language-specific crawling. 
As a summary, the link structure analysis of lan-
guage graphs can be a useful tool for various spec-
trums of socio-linguistic and technical research 
purposes.  
8 Limitations and Future Work  
The results of this research are highly dependent 
on the language identification module (LIM). With 
a more improved LIM, more accurate results can 
be presented. Currently, there is an ongoing ex-
periment that uses a new LIM. 
This analysis will also be done to the secondary-
level-domains to show the language distribution 
for different social areas. 
Future work also includes the creation of a lan-
guage-specific crawler that will incorporate the 
results derived from the analysis of the SCC size 
and diameter of the language subgraphs.
