Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach for ex-
ploiting the global context for the task of
word sense disambiguation (WSD). This is
done by using topic features constructed us-
ing the latent dirichlet alocation (LDA) al-
gorithm on unlabeled data. The features are
incorporated into a modified na??ve Bayes
network alongside other features such as
part-of-speech of neighboring words, single
words in the surrounding context, local col-
locations, and syntactic patterns. In both the
English all-words task and the English lex-
ical sample task, the method achieved sig-
nificant improvement over the simple na??ve
Bayes classifier and higher accuracy than the
best official scores on Senseval-3 for both
task.
1 Introduction
Natural language tends to be ambiguous. A word
often has more than one meanings depending on the
context. Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a nat-
ural language processing (NLP) task in which the
correct meaning (sense) of a word in a given context
is to be determined.
Supervised corpus-based approach has been the
most successful in WSD to date. In such an ap-
proach, a corpus in which ambiguous words have
been annotated with correct senses is first collected.
Knowledge sources, or features, from the context of
the annotated word are extracted to form the training
data. A learning algorithm, like the support vector
machine (SVM) or na??ve Bayes, is then applied on
the training data to learn the model. Finally, in test-
ing, the learnt model is applied on the test data to
assign the correct sense to any ambiguous word.
The features used in these systems usually in-
clude local features, such as part-of-speech (POS)
of neighboring words, local collocations , syntac-
tic patterns and global features such as single words
in the surrounding context (bag-of-words) (Lee and
Ng, 2002). However, due to the data scarcity prob-
lem, these features are usually very sparse in the
training data. There are, on average, 11 and 28
training cases per sense in Senseval 2 and 3 lexi-
cal sample task respectively, and 6.5 training cases
per sense in the SemCor corpus. This problem is
especially prominent for the bag-of-words feature;
more than hundreds of bag-of-words are usually ex-
tracted for each training instance and each feature
could be drawn from any English word. A direct
consequence is that the global context information,
which the bag-of-words feature is supposed to cap-
ture, may be poorly represented.
Our approach tries to address this problem by
clustering features to relieve the scarcity problem,
specifically on the bag-of-words feature. In the pro-
cess, we construct topic features, trained using the
latent dirichlet alocation (LDA) algorithm. We train
the topic model (Blei et al, 2003) on unlabeled data,
clustering the words occurring in the corpus to a pre-
defined number of topics. We then use the resulting
topic model to tag the bag-of-words in the labeled
corpus with topic distributions. We incorporate the
distributions, called the topic features, using a sim-
ple Bayesian network, modified from na??ve Bayes
1015
model, alongside other features and train the model
on the labeled corpus. The approach gives good per-
formance on both the lexical sample and all-words
tasks on Senseval data.
The paper makes mainly two contributions. First,
we are able to show that a feature that efficiently
captures the global context information using LDA
algorithm can significantly improve the WSD ac-
curacy. Second, we are able to obtain this feature
from unlabeled data, which spares us from any man-
ual labeling work. We also showcase the potential
strength of Bayesian network in the WSD task, ob-
taining performance that rivals state-of-arts meth-
ods.
2 Related Work
Many WSD systems try to tackle the data scarcity
problem. Unsupervised learning is introduced pri-
marily to deal with the problem, but with limited
success (Snyder and Palmer, 2004). In another ap-
proach, the learning algorithm borrows training in-
stances from other senses and effectively increases
the training data size. In (Kohomban and Lee,
2005), the classifier is trained using grouped senses
for verbs and nouns according to WordNet top-level
synsets and thus effectively pooling training cases
across senses within the same synset. Similarly,
(Ando, 2006) exploits data from related tasks, using
all labeled examples irrespective of target words for
learning each sense using the Alternating Structure
Optimization (ASO) algorithm (Ando and Zhang,
2005a; Ando and Zhang, 2005b). Parallel texts is
proposed in (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997) as po-
tential training data and (Chan and Ng, 2005) has
shown that using automatically gathered parallel
texts for nouns could significantly increase WSD ac-
curacy, when tested on Senseval-2 English all-words
task.
Our approach is somewhat similar to that of us-
ing generic language features such as POS tags; the
words are tagged with its semantic topic that may be
trained from other corpuses.
3 Feature Construction
We first present the latent dirichlet alocation algo-
rithm and its inference procedures, adapted from the
original paper (Blei et al, 2003).
3.1 Latent Dirichlet Allocation
LDA is a probabilistic model for collections of dis-
crete data and has been used in document model-
ing and text classification. It can be represented
as a three level hierarchical Bayesian model, shown
graphically in Figure 1. Given a corpus consisting of
M documents, LDA models each document using a
mixture over K topics, which are in turn character-
ized as distributions over words.
?
wz??
N
M
Figure 1: Graphical Model for LDA
In the generative process of LDA, for each doc-
ument d we first draw the mixing proportion over
topics ?d from a Dirichlet prior with parameters ?.
Next, for each of the Nd words wdn in document d, a
topic zdn is first drawn from a multinomial distribu-
tion with parameters ?d. Finally wdn is drawn from
the topic specific distribution over words. The prob-
ability of a word token w taking on value i given
that topic z = j was chosen is parameterized using
a matrix ? with ?ij = p(w = i|z = j). Integrating
out ?d?s and zdn?s, the probability p(D|?, ?) of the
corpus is thus:
M?
d=1
?
p(?d|?)
(
Nd?
n=1
?
zdn
p(zdn|?d)p(wdn|zdn, ?)
)
d?d
3.1.1 Inference
Unfortunately, it is intractable to directly solve the
posterior distribution of the hidden variables given a
document, namely p(?, z|w, ?, ?). However, (Blei
et al, 2003) has shown that by introducing a set of
variational parameters, ? and ?, a tight lower bound
on the log likelihood of the probability can be found
using the following optimization procedure:
(??, ??) = argmin
?,?
D(q(?, z|?, ?)?p(?, z|w, ?, ?))
1016
where
q(?, z|?, ?) = q(?|?)
N?
n=1
q(zn|?n),
? is the Dirichlet parameter for ? and the multino-
mial parameters (?1 ? ? ??N ) are the free variational
parameters. Note here ? is document specific in-
stead of corpus specific like ?. Graphically, it is rep-
resented as Figure 2. The optimizing values of ? and
? can be found by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence between the variational distribution
and the true posterior.

3.2 Baseline Features
For both the lexical sample and all-words tasks,
we use the following standard baseline features for
comparison.
POS Tags For each training or testing word, w,
we include POS tags for P words prior to as well as
after w within the same sentence boundary. We also
include the POS tag of w. If there are fewer than
P words prior or after w in the same sentence, we
denote the corresponding feature as NIL.
Local Collocations Collocation Ci,j refers to the
ordered sequence of tokens (words or punctuations)
surrounding w. The starting and ending position of
the sequence are denoted i and j respectively, where
a negative value refers to the token position prior to
w. We adopt the same 11 collocation features as
(Lee and Ng, 2002), namely C?1,?1, C1,1, C?2,?2,
C2,2, C?2,?1, C?1,1, C1,2, C?3,?1, C?2,1, C?1,2,
and C1,3.
Bag-of-Words For each training or testing word,
w, we get G words prior to as well as after w, within
the same document. These features are position in-
sensitive. The words we extract are converted back
to their morphological root forms.
Syntactic Relations We adopt the same syntactic
relations as (Lee and Ng, 2002). For easy reference,
we summarize the features into Table 1.

Noun Parent headword h
POS of h
Relative position of h to w
Verb Left nearest child word of w, l
Right nearest child word of w, r
POS of l

POS of w
Voice of w
Adjective Parent headword h
POS of h
Table 1: Syntactic Relations Features
The exact values of P and G for each task are set
according to cross validation result.
3.3 Topic Features
We first select an unlabeled corpus, such as 20
Newsgroups, and extract individual words from it
(excluding stopwords). We choose the number of
topics, K, for the unlabeled corpus and we apply the
LDA algorithm to obtain the ? parameters, where
? represents the probability of a word wi given a
topic zj , p(wi|zj) = ?ij . The model essentially
clusters words that occurred in the unlabeled cor-
pus according to K topics. The conditional prob-
ability p(wi|zj) = ?ij is later used to tag the words
in the unseen test example with the probability of
each topic.
For some variants of the classifiers that we con-
struct, we also use the ? parameter, which is doc-
ument specific. For these classifiers, we may need
to run the inference algorithm on the labeled corpus
and possibly on the test documents. The ? param-
eter provides an approximation to the probability of
1017
selecting topic i in the document:
p(zi|?) =
?i
?
K ?k
. (1)
4 Classifier Construction
4.1 Bayesian Network
We construct a variant of the na??ve Bayes network
as shown in Figure 3. Here, w refers to the word.
s refers to the sense of the word. In training, s is
observed while in testing, it is not. The features f1
to fn are baseline features mentioned in Section 3.2
(including bag-of-words) while z refers to the la-
tent topic that we set for clustering unlabeled corpus.
The bag-of-words b are extracted from the neigh-
bours of w and there are L of them. Note that L can
be different from G, which is the number of bag-of-
words in baseline features. Both will be determined
by the validation result.

Figure 3: Graphical Model with LDA feature
The log-likelihood of an instance, `(w, s, F, b)
where F denotes the set of baseline features, can be
written as
= logp(w) + logp(s|w) +
?
F
log(p(f |s))
+
?
L
log
(
?
K
p(zk|s)p(bl|zk)
)
.
The log p(w) term is constant and thus can be ig-
nored. The first portion is normal na??ve Bayes. And
second portion represents the additional LDA plate.
We decouple the training process into three separate
stages. We first extract baseline features from the
task training data, and estimate, using normal na??ve
Bayes, p(s|w) and p(f |s) for all w, s and f . The
parameters associated with p(b|z) are estimated us-
ing LDA from unlabeled data. Finally we estimate
the parameters associated with p(z|s). We experi-
mented with three different ways of both doing the
estimation as well as using the resulting model and
chose one which performed best empirically.
4.1.1 Expectation Maximization Approach
For p(z|s), a reasonable estimation method is to
use maximum likelihood estimation. This can be
done using the expectation maximization (EM) algo-
rithm. In classification, we just choose s? that maxi-
mizes the log-likelihood of the test instance, where:
s? = argmax
s
`(w, s, F, b)
In this approach, ? is never used which means the
LDA inference procedure is not used on any labeled
data at all.
4.1.2 Soft Tagging Approach
Classification in this approach is done using the
full Bayesian network just as in the EM approach.
However we do the estimation of p(z|s) differently.
Essentially, we perform LDA inference on the train-
ing corpus in order to obtain ? for each document.
We then use the ? and ? to obtain p(z|b) for each
word using
p(zi|bl, ?) =
p(bl|zi)p(zi|?)
?
K p(bl|zk)p(zk|?)
,
where equation [1] is used for estimation of p(zi|?).
This effectively transforms b to a topical distri-
bution which we call a soft tag where each soft
tag is probability distribution t1, . . . , tK on topics.
We then use this topical distribution for estimating
p(z|s). Let si be the observed sense of instance i
and tij1 , . . . , t
ij
K be the soft tag of the j-th bag-of-
word feature of instance i. We estimate p(z|s) as
p(zjk|s) =
?
si=s t
ij
k
?
si=s
?
k? t
ij
k?
(2)
This approach requires us to do LDA inference on
the corpus formed by the labeled training data, but
1018
not the testing data. This is because we need ? to
get transformed topical distribution in order to learn
p(z|s) in the training. In the testing, we only apply
the learnt parameters to the model.
4.1.3 Hard Tagging Approach
Hard tagging approach no longer assumes that z is
latent. After p(z|b) is obtained using the same pro-
cedure in Section 4.1.2, the topic zi with the high-
est p(zi|b) among all K topics is picked to represent
z. In this way, b is transformed into a single most
?prominent? topic. This topic label is used in the
same way as baseline features for both training and
testing in a simple na??ve Bayes model.
This approach requires us to perform the transfor-
mation both on the training as well as testing data,
since z becomes an observed variable. LDA infer-
ence is done on two corpora, one formed by the
training data and the other by testing data, in order
to get the respective values of ?.
4.2 Support Vector Machine Approach
In the SVM (Vapnik, 1995) approach, we first form a
training and a testing file using all standard features
for each sense following (Lee and Ng, 2002) (one
classifier per sense). To incorporate LDA feature,
we use the same approach as Section 4.1.2 to trans-
form b into soft tags, p(z|b). As SVM deals with
only observed features, we need to transform b both
in the training data and in the testing data. Compared
to (Lee and Ng, 2002), the only difference is that for
each training and testing case, we have additional
L ?K LDA features, since there are L bag-of-words
and each has a topic distribution represented by K
values.
5 Experimental Setup
We describe here the experimental setup on the En-
glish lexical sample task and all-words task.
We use MXPOST tagger (Adwait, 1996) for POS
tagging, Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) for ex-
tracting syntactic relations, SVMlight1 for SVM
classifier and David Blei?s version of LDA2 for LDA
training and inference. All default parameters are
used unless mentioned otherwise. For all standard
1http://svmlight.joachims.org
2http://www.cs.princeton.edu/?blei/lda-c/
baseline features, we use Laplace smoothing but for
the soft tag (equation [2]), we use a smoothing pa-
rameter value of 2.
5.1 Development Process
5.1.1 Lexical Sample Task
We use the Senseval-2 lexical sample task for
preliminary investigation of different algorithms,
datasets and other parameters. As the dataset is used
extensively for this purpose, only the Senseval-3 lex-
ical sample task is used for evaluation.
Selecting Bayesian Network The best achievable
result, using the three different Bayesian network
approaches, when validating on Senseval-2 test data
is shown in Table 2. The parameters that are used
are P = 3 and G = 3.
EM 68.0
Hard Tagging 65.6
Soft Tagging 68.9
Table 2: Results on Senseval-2 English lexical sam-
ple using different Bayesian network approaches.
From the results, it appears that both the EM and
the Hard Tagging approaches did not yield as good
results as the Soft Tagging approach did. The EM
approach ignores the LDA inference result, ?, which
we use to get our topic prior. This information is
document specific and can be regarded as global
context information. The Hard Tagging approach
also uses less information, as the original topic dis-
tribution is now represented only by the topic with
the highest probability of occurring. Therefore, both
methods have information loss and are disadvan-
taged against the Soft Tagging approach. We use
the Soft Tagging approach for the Senseval-3 lexical
sample and the all-words tasks.
Unlabeled Corpus Selection The unlabeled cor-
pus we choose to train LDA include 20 News-
groups, Reuters, SemCor, Senseval-2 lexical sam-
ple data and Senseval-3 lexical sample data. Al-
though the last three are labeled corpora, we only
need the words from these corpora and thus they can
be regarded as unlabeled too. For Senseval-2 and
Senseval-3 data, we define the whole passage for
each training and testing instance as one document.
1019
The relative effect using different corpus and com-
binations of them is shown in Table 3, when validat-
ing on Senseval-2 test data using the Soft Tagging
approach.

Senseval-3 0.6M 50 60 67.6
All 4.5M 60 40 68.9
Table 3: Effect of using different corpus for LDA
training, |w| represents the corpus size in terms of
the number of words in the corpus
The 20 Newsgroups corpus yields the best result
if used individually. It has a relatively larger corpus
size at 1.7 million words in total and also a well bal-
anced topic distribution among its documents, rang-
ing across politics, finance, science, computing, etc.
The Reuters corpus, on the other hand, focuses heav-
ily on finance related articles and has a rather skewed
topic distribution. This probably contributed to its
inferior result. However, we found that the best re-
sult comes from combining all the corpora together
with K = 60 and L = 40.
Results for Optimized Configuration As base-
line for the Bayesian network approaches, we use
na??ve Bayes with all baseline features. For the base-
line SVM approach, we choose P = 3 and include
all the words occurring in the training and testing
passage as bag-of-words feature.
The F-measure result we achieve on Senseval-2
test data is shown in Table 4. Our four systems
are listed as the top four entries in the table. Soft
Tag refers to the soft tagging Bayesian network ap-
proach. Note that we used the Senseval-2 test data
for optimizing the configuration (as is done in the
ASO result). Hence, the result should not be taken
as reliable. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the
improvement of Bayesian network approach over its
baseline is very significant (+5.5%). On the other
hand, SVM with topic features shows limited im-
provement over its baseline (+0.8%).

5.1.2 All-words Task
In the all-words task, no official training data is
provided with Senseval. We follow the common
practice of using the SemCor corpus as our training
data. However, we did not use SVM approach in this
task as there are too few training instances per sense
for SVM to achieve a reasonably good accuracy.
As there are more training instances in SemCor,
230, 000 in total, we obtain the optimal configura-
tion using 10 fold cross validation on the SemCor
training data. With the optimal configuration, we
test our system on both Senseval-2 and Senseval-3
official test data.
For baseline features, we set P = 3 and B = 1. We
choose a LDA training corpus comprising 20 News-
groups and SemCor data, with number of topics K
= 40 and number of LDA bag-of-words L = 14.
6 Results
We now present the results on both English lexical
sample task and all-words task.
6.1 Lexical Sample Task
With the optimal configurations from Senseval-2,
we tested the systems on Senseval-3 data. Table 5
shows our F-measure result compared to some of the
best reported systems. Although SVM with topic
features shows limited success with only a 0.6%
improvement, the Bayesian network approach has
again demonstrated a good improvement of 3.8%
over its baseline and is better than previous reported
best systems except ASO(Ando, 2006).

tems as well as previous best systems for Senseval-2
and Senseval-3 all-words task are shown in Table 6
and Table 7 respectively. Bayesian network with soft
tagging achieved 2.6% improvement over its base-
line in Senseval-2 and 1.7% in Senseval-3. The re-
sults also rival some previous best systems, except
for SMUaw (Mihalcea, 2002) which used additional
labeled data.

6.3 Significance of Results
We perform the ?2-test, using the Bayesian network
and its na??ve Bayes baseline (NB baseline) as pairs,
to verify the significance of these results. The result
is reported in Table 8. The results are significant at
90% confidence level, except for the Senseval-3 all-
words task.

Table 8: P value for ?2-test significance levels of
results.
6.4 SVM with Topic Features
The results on lexical sample task show that SVM
benefits less from the topic feature than the Bayesian
approach. One possible reason is that SVM base-
line is able to use all bag-of-words from surround-
ing context while na??ve Bayes baseline can only use
very few without decreasing its accuracy, due to the
sparse representation. In this sense, SVM baseline
already captures some of the topical information,
leaving a smaller room for improvement. In fact, if
we exclude the bag-of-words feature from the SVM
baseline and add in the topic features, we are able
to achieve almost the same accuracy as we did with
both features included, as shown in Table 9. This
further shows that the topic feature is a better rep-
resentation of global context than the bag-of-words
feature.

6.7 Results on SemEval-1
We participated in SemEval-1 English coarse-
grained all-words task (task 7), English fine-grained
all-words task (task 17, subtask 3) and English
coarse-grained lexical sample task (task 17, subtask
1), using the method described in this paper. For
all-words task, we use Senseval-2 and Senseval-3
all-words task data as our validation set to fine tune
the parameters. For lexical sample task, we use the
training data provided as the validation set.
We achieved 88.7%, 81.6% and 57.6% for coarse-
grained lexical sample task, coarse-grained all-
words task and fine-grained all-words task respec-
tively. The results ranked first, second and fourth in
the three tasks respectively.
7 Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we showed that by using LDA algo-
rithm on bag-of-words feature, one can utilise more
topical information and boost the classifiers accu-
racy on both English lexical sample and all-words
task. Only unlabeled data is needed for this improve-
ment. It would be interesting to see how the feature
can help on WSD of other languages and other nat-
ural language processing tasks such as named-entity
recognition.

Abstract
We participated in SemEval-1 English
coarse-grained all-words task (task 7), En-
glish fine-grained all-words task (task 17,
subtask 3) and English coarse-grained lex-
ical sample task (task 17, subtask 1). The
same method with different labeled data is
used for the tasks; SemCor is the labeled
corpus used to train our system for the all-
words tasks while the labeled corpus that
is provided is used for the lexical sam-
ple task. The knowledge sources include
part-of-speech of neighboring words, single
words in the surrounding context, local col-
locations, and syntactic patterns. In addi-
tion, we constructed a topic feature, targeted
to capture the global context information,
using the latent dirichlet alocation (LDA)
algorithm with unlabeled corpus. A modi-
fied na??ve Bayes classifier is constructed to
incorporate all the features. We achieved
81.6%, 57.6%, 88.7% for coarse-grained all-
words task, fine-grained all-words task and
coarse-grained lexical sample task respec-
tively.
1 Introduction
Supervised corpus-based approach has been the
most successful in WSD to date. However, this ap-
proach faces severe data scarcity problem, resulting
features being sparsely represented in the training
data. This problem is especially prominent for the
bag-of-words feature. A direct consequence is that
the global context information, which the bag-of-
words feature is supposed to capture, may be poorly
represented.
Our system tries to address this problem by
clustering features to relieve the scarcity problem,
specifically on the bag-of-words feature. In the pro-
cess, we construct topic features, trained using the
latent dirichlet alocation (LDA) algorithm. We train
the topic model (Blei et al, 2003) on unlabeled data,
clustering the words occurring in the corpus to a pre-
defined number of topics. We then use the resulting
topic model to tag the bag-of-words in the labeled
corpus with topic distributions.
We incorporate the distributions, called the topic
features, using a simple Bayesian network, modified
from na??ve Bayes model, alongside other features
and train the model on the labeled corpus.
2 Feature Construction
2.1 Baseline Features
For both the lexical sample and all-words tasks, we
use the following standard baseline features.
POS Tags For each word instance w, we include
POS tags for P words prior to as well as after w
within the same sentence boundary. We also include
the POS tag of w. If there are fewer than P words
prior or after w in the same sentence, we denote the
corresponding feature as NIL.
Local Collocations We adopt the same 11 col-
location features as (Lee and Ng, 2002), namely
C?1,?1, C1,1, C?2,?2, C2,2, C?2,?1, C?1,1, C1,2,
C?3,?1, C?2,1, C?1,2, and C1,3.
249
Bag-of-Words For each training or testing word,
w, we get G words prior to as well as after w, within
the same document. These features are position in-
sensitive. The words we extract are converted back
to their morphological root forms.
Syntactic Relations We adopt the same syntactic
relations as (Lee and Ng, 2002). For easy reference,
we summarize the features into Table 1.
POS of w Features
Noun Parent headword h
POS of h
Relative position of h to w
Verb Left nearest child word of w, l
Right nearest child word of w, r
POS of l
POS of r
POS of w
Voice of w
Adjective Parent headword h
POS of h
Table 1: Syntactic Relations Features
The exact values of P and G for each task are set
according to validation result.
2.2 Latent Dirichlet Allocation
We present here the latent dirichlet alocation algo-
rithm and its inference procedures, adapted from the
original paper (Blei et al, 2003).
LDA is a probabilistic model for collections of
discrete data and has been used in document mod-
eling and text classification. It can be represented
as a three level hierarchical Bayesian model, shown
graphically in Figure 1. Given a corpus consisting of
M documents, LDA models each document using a
mixture over K topics, which are in turn character-
ized as distributions over words.
In the generative process of LDA, for each doc-
ument d we first draw the mixing proportion over
topics ?d from a Dirichlet prior with parameters ?.
Next, for each of the Nd words wdn in document d, a
topic zdn is first drawn from a multinomial distribu-
tion with parameters ?d. Finally wdn is drawn from
the topic specific distribution over words. The prob-
ability of a word token w taking on value i given
that topic z = j was chosen is parameterized using
?
wz??
N
M
Figure 1: Graphical Model for LDA
a matrix ? with ?ij = p(w = i|z = j). Integrating
out ?d?s and zdn?s, the probability p(D|?, ?) of the
corpus is thus:
M?
d=1
?
p(?d|?)
(
Nd?
n=1
?
zdn
p(zdn|?d)p(wdn|zdn, ?)
)
d?d
In variational inference, the latent variables ?d
and zdn are assumed independent and updates to
the variational posteriors for ?d and zdn are derived
(Blei et al, 2003). It can be shown that the varia-
tional posterior for ?d is a Dirichlet distribution, say
with variational parameters ?d, which we shall use
in the following to construct topic features.
2.3 Topic Features
We first select an unlabeled corpus, such as 20
Newsgroups, and extract individual words from it
(excluding stopwords). We choose the number of
topics, K, for the unlabeled corpus and we apply the
LDA algorithm to obtain the ? parameters, where ?
represents the probability of a word w = i given a
topic z = j, p(w = i|z = j) = ?ij .
The model essentially clusters words that oc-
curred in the unlabeled corpus according to K top-
ics. The conditional probability p(w = i|z = j) =
?ij is later used to tag the words in the unseen test
example with the probability of each topic.
We also use the document-specific ?d parameters.
Specifically, we need to run the inference algorithm
on the labeled corpus to get ?d for each document d
in the corpus. The ?d parameter provides an approx-
imation to the probability of selecting topic i in the
document:
p(zi|?d) =
?di
?
K ?dk
. (1)

3 Classifier Construction
We construct a variant of the na??ve Bayes network
as shown in Figure 2. Here, w refers to the word.
s refers to the sense of the word. In training, s is
observed while in testing, it is not. The features f1
to fn are baseline features mentioned in Section 2.1
(including bag-of-words) while z refers to the la-
tent topic that we set for clustering unlabeled corpus.
The bag-of-words b are extracted from the neigh-
bours of w and there are L of them. Note that L can
be different from G, which is the number of bag-of-
words in baseline features. Both will be determined
by the validation result.
? ? ?
? ?? ?

Figure 2: Graphical Model with LDA feature
The log-likelihood of an instance, `(w, s, F, b)
where F denotes the set of baseline features, can be
written as
= logp(w) + logp(s|w) +
?
F
log(p(f |s))
+
?
L
log
(
?
K
p(zk|s)p(bl|zk)
)
.
The log p(w) term is constant and thus can be
ignored. The first portion is normal na??ve Bayes.
And second portion represents the additional LDA
plate. We decouple the training process into separate
stages. We first extract baseline features from the
task training data, and estimate, using normal na??ve
Bayes, p(s|w) and p(f |s) for all w, s and f .
Next, the parameters associated with p(b|z) are
estimated using LDA from unlabeled data, which is
?. To estimate p(z|s), we perform LDA inference
on the training corpus in order to obtain ?d for each
document d. We then use the ?d and ? to obtain
p(z|b) for each word using
p(zi|bl, ?d) =
p(bl|zi)p(zi|?d)
?
K p(bl|zk)p(zk|?d)
,
where equation (1) is used for estimation of p(zi|?d).
This effectively transforms b to a topical distri-
bution which we call a soft tag where each soft
tag is probability distribution t1, . . . , tK on topics.
We then use this topical distribution for estimating
p(z|s). Let si be the observed sense of instance i
and tij1 , . . . , t
ij
K be the soft tag of the j-th bag-of-
word feature of instance i. We estimate p(z|s) as
p(zjk|s) =
?
si=s t
ij
k
?
si=s
?
k? t
ij
k?
(2)
This approach requires us to do LDA inference on
the corpus formed by the labeled training data, but
not the testing data. This is because we need ? to
get transformed topical distribution in order to learn
p(z|s) in the training. In the testing, we only apply
the learnt parameters to the model.
4 Experimental Setup
We describe here the experimental setup on the En-
glish lexical sample task and all-words task. Note
that we do not distinguish the two all-words tasks as
the same parameters will be applied.
For lexical sample task, we use 5-fold cross val-
idation on the training data provided to determine
our parameters. For all-words task, we use SemCor
as our training data and validate on Senseval-2 and
Senseval-3 all-words test data.
We use MXPOST tagger (Adwait, 1996) for POS
tagging, Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) for ex-
tracting syntactic relations, and David Blei?s version
of LDA1 for LDA training and inference. All default
parameters are used unless mentioned otherwise.
For the all-word tasks, we use sense 1 as back-off
for words that have not appeared in SemCor. We use
the same fine-grained system for both the coarse and
fine-grained all-words tasks. We make predictions
1http://www.cs.princeton.edu/?blei/lda-c/
251
for all words for all the systems - precision, recall
and accuracy scores are all the same.
Baseline features For lexical sample task, we
choose P = 3 and G = 3. For all-words task, we
choose P = 3 and G = 1. (G = 1 means only the
nearest word prior and after the test word.)
Smoothing For all standard baseline features, we
use Laplace smoothing but for the soft tag (equation
(2)), we use a smoothing parameter value of 2 for
all-words task and 0.1 for lexical sample task.
Unlabeled Corpus Selection The unlabeled cor-
pus we select from for LDA training include 20
Newsgroups, Reuters, SemCor, Senseval-2 lexical
sample data, Senseval-3 lexical sample data and
SemEval-1 lexical sample data. Although the last
four are labeled corpora, we only need the words
from these corpora and thus they can be regarded as
unlabeled too. For lexical sample data, we define the
whole passage for each training and testing instance
as one document.
For lexical sample task, we use all the unlabeled
corpus mentioned with K = 60 and L = 18. For
all-words task, we use a corpora consisting only 20
Newsgroups and SemCor with K = 40 and L = 14.
Validation Result Table 2 shows the results we
get on the validation sets. We give both the system
accuracy (named as Soft Tag) and the na??ve Bayes
result with only standard features as baseline.
Validation Set Soft Tag NB baseline

5 Official Results
We now present the official results on all three tasks
we participated in, summarized in Table 3.
The system ranked first, fourth and second in
the lexical sample task, fine-grained all-words task
and coarse-grained all-words task respectively. For
coarse-grained all-words task, we obtained 86.1,
88.3, 81.4, 76.7 and 79.1 for each document, from
d001 to d005.

5.1 Analysis of Results
For the lexical sample task, we compare the re-
sults to that of our na??ve Bayes baseline and Sup-
port Vector Machine (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995) base-
line. Our SVM classifier (using SVMlight) follows
that of (Lee and Ng, 2002), which ranked the third
in Senseval-3 English lexical sample task. We also
analyse the result according to the test instance?s
part-of-speech and find that the improvements are
consistent for both noun and verb.
System Noun Verb Total
Soft Tag 92.7 84.2 88.7
NB baseline 91.7 83.5 87.8
SVM baseline 91.6 83.1 87.6
Table 4: Analysis on different POS on English lexi-
cal sample task
Our coarse-grained all-words task result outper-
formed the first sense baseline score of 0.7889 by
about 2.7%.
