Quantifying Ellipsis in Dialogue:  an index of mutual understanding   Marcus Colman, Arash Eshghi and Patrick G. T. Healey Interaction, Media and Communication Research Group Queen Mary, University of London E1 4NS UK {marcus, arash, ph}@dcs.qmul.ac.uk        Abstract 
This paper presents a coding protocol that al-lows na?ve users to annotate dialogue tran-scripts for anaphora and ellipsis. Cohen's kappa statistic demonstrates that the protocol is sufficiently robust in terms of reliability. It is proposed that quantitative ellipsis data may be used as an index of mutual-engagement. Current and potential uses of ellipsis coding are described. 
1. Introduction Spontaneously generated dialogue, whether natu-rally occurring or task-oriented, rarely sticks to accepted rules of grammar or even politeness. In-terruptions, ungrammatical utterances and grunts or other noises are found in the majority of contri-butions in dialogue corpora. One reason for this is the ubiquitous use of ellipsis; the omission of words or phrases from a contribution which can be inferred or extracted from previous contributions. Ellipsis is optional; the full constituent could serve communication as well as the elliptical version. Where ellipsis occurs across speakers i.e., one par-ticipant makes (elliptical) use of another?s contri-bution, it provides a direct index of the mutual-accessibility of the current conversational context (cf. Healey et. al. 2007; Eshghi and Healey, 2007).      In some cases elliptical contributions are obvi-ous, as in the polar response 'yeah', signifying that a question has been heard, understood and consid-
ered; however, there are degrees of complexity that would seem to require a close understanding of what another participant is referring to. It is this issue of mutual-accessibility or 'grounding' that we propose can be investigated through the quantifica-tion of elliptical phenomena. These phenomena are, we propose, also related to the way referring expressions can contract over repeated use.  (e.g.  Schober and Clark, 1989; Wilkes-Gibbs and Clark, 1992). The approach taken in Clark et al's 'col-laborative theory' is that as mutual understanding increases, dialogue contributions become shorter as referring terms become part of the common ground. Clark and Krych (2004) note that various elliptical phrases can be used to establish common ground, from continuers ('uh-huh', 'yeah') or as-sessments ('gosh') to establishing shared attention through deictic expressions such as 'this', 'that', 'here' and 'there'.    Healey et al (2007) demonstrated the basic con-cept and viability of quantifying ellipsis phenom-ena as a quantitative index of mutual-accessibility of context. They showed that the frequency of use of cross-speaker elliptical expressions in online chat varies systematically depending on whether communication is ?local? i.e. within a single chat room or ?remote?.  However, the coding of ellipsis in this study did not follow an explicit protocol. It relied mainly on the distinctions made by Fernan-dez et al (2004)  but specific measures of reliabil-ity and validity were not calculated.

 Figure 1. ?Anaphora? decision chart   In this paper we present an ellipsis coding protocol that provides a set of coding categories and we re-port the inter-rater reliability scores that have been obtained with it. In order to simplify coding and increase reliability, categories suggested by Fer-nandez et al have been collapsed into broader ones. It should be pointed out that we are not, in general, trying to produce an accurate or definitive analysis of ellipsis. The protocol is rather the prod-uct of contending with the compromise between robust coding categories and linguistic elegance. The categories presented here are generally or-dered in terms of occurrence in order to assist the coder. A contribution to dialogue may contain more than one type of elliptical utterance; contri-butions are not assigned to one mutually exclusive category. Rather, coders are able to use the proto-col to label any part of a dialogue that is elliptical. 2. The Ellipsis Protocol  The protocol is designed as a tool for coding one aspect of dialogue, developed with the intention    
 Figure 2. ?Answers? decision chart  that users with no specific knowledge of linguistics can use it. As can be seen from Figures 1-4, it con-sists of four binary branching decision trees that are applied to each contribution in an interaction. Full instructions for use of the protocol have also been written and are available from the authors. 3. Inter-rater reliability In order to demonstrate reliability between coders, two coders (one computer scientist, one psycholo-gist) applied the ellipsis protocol to a sample of task oriented dialogue. This was taken from the HCRC Map Task corpus (Anderson et al 1991); a series of dialogues in which one participant at-tempts to describe a route on a fictional map to another. The longest of these dialogues was chosen to be coded (transcript Q1NC1) which consisted of 446 turns and 5533 words. Cohen's kappa was cal-culated using the procedure outlined in Howell (1994); see Carletta (1996) for a discussion of the use of kappa in dialogue coding. Kappa in this in-stance was .81, which shows very high reliability, even by conservative standards (Krippendorff,

 Figure 3. ?Questions? decision chart  1980). Table 1 below presents a breakdown of the instances of categories that were agreed upon. Table 1 shows the total number and approximate percentage of agreements. Also given, '1.dis' and '2.dis' are the number of observed instances by coders one and two respectively identified but dis-puted for that particular category. The total number of elliptical or non-elliptical instances coded, from single words or phrases to entire turns was 624; of these, 100 (16%) were disagreed upon and 78 in-stances (12.5%) were agreed to contain no ellipti-cal phenomena (no ellipsis disagreements = 50). Some categories have very low frequencies; how-ever, previous work suggests that these categories are necessary. To some extent this table shows the limitations of the kappa statistic; coder agreement varies considerably across these categories.

4. Discussion  Although mutual-accessibility of context is funda-mental to communication, there has not been a re-liable method for observing or measuring it. The ellipsis protocol presented here thus provides a useful step in this direction. It gives a standardised coding scheme that can quantify the extent to which speakers can directly access the constituents of each other?s turns.     In previous work there have been several differ-ent attempts to define taxonomies of elliptical or context dependent utterances. For example, non-sentential utterances (NSUs), e.g. Schlangen and Lascarides (2003); Fernandez and Ginzburg (2002); Fernandez, Ginzburg and Lappin (2007). One issue with these previous approaches is the lack of reliability data; a statistic such as Cohen?s kappa is needed in order to demonstrate that a tax-onomy or coding scheme can be reliably applied between independent coders. Carletta et al (1997) presented a reliable coding scheme for the classifi-cation of dialogue moves; although there are over-laps between their categories and ours, the questions used in the scheme are intended to estab-lish solely the function of an utterance and impor-tantly, not whether the utterance is elliptical. The protocol presented here achieves a high level of reliability for some of these context dependent phenomena without requiring specific prior knowl-edge of the relevant linguistic theory.    Further work will code a sample from the BNC (Burnard, 2000) in order to allow comparisons with previous taxonomies. The HCRC map task corpus has previously been examined in terms of various features of dialogue, e.g. Dialogue Games Analysis (Kowtko et al 1991) and disfluencies (Lickley and Bard, 1998). Ongoing work will de-velop this through coding the entire HCRC map task corpus; providing data on how ellipsis varies over different conditions such as medium, familiar-ity and task role.
