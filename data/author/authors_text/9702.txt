Abstract. This paper discusses verb information items in the grammatical 
knowledge dictionary of Tibetan language. The verb information items include 
morphology, word-formation and syntax, in which the core is the verb 
classification with syntactic and semantic features. So the influences on clause 
structures of 12 types of verbs have been discussed. Also the paper designs an 
information table to compile the verb items and their related knowledge, in 
which most of the details of verbs have been described. At last some newly-
found phenomena have been discussed and the paper therefore proposes that 
there are still some special tokens or constructs need to be mined out in Tibetan. 
1   The Background of Constructing a Grammatical Knowledge 
Dictionary 
Segmentation is one of the important tasks of text-processing in Tibetan. In order to 
gain satisfactory results we have proposed a suggestion, in which most of chunks can 
be identified with markers of chunks, and words can be segmented within chunks. 
Although the proposal achieved well in our sample of small scale data,[1] yet the 
wrong match and ambiguous phenomenon still obstruct our future work in the real 
texts. The reasons, we think, are in two aspects. One is lack of a perfect Tibetan 
grammatical system which is now still not constructed for information processing. 
Another is deficient in useful resources, especially a Tibetan knowledge dictionary of 
high quality with morphological and syntactic information. 
A grammatical knowledge dictionary means a base with some essential 
information of the morphological and syntactic grammar, including pragmatic and 
rhetorical information as well. With such a dictionary, most phenomenon of mistaken 
word matching and recognizing, to some extent, may perhaps be eliminated during 
the word-segmenting. As to Tibetan, there are three main types of lexical information. 
Firstly, the lexical item itself is a kind of grammatical functional markers, such as, the 
genitive markers; secondly, the lexical item serves as a formal marker of some 
grammatical sections, such as, in sku gdung ?Buddha?s bone?, ?sku? acted as the 
prefix morpheme of the honorific words can construct amounts of honorific 
vocabulary;[2] last, the grammatical function of words may be ascertained after being 
analyzed, such as the verb yid ches byed ?trust? belongs to the cognition verbs, which 
 The Verbal Entries and Their Description in a Grammatical Information-Dictionary 875 
specify case markers for their subjects and objects. Nevertheless, no matter which 
information types, they all need previously be tagged as information attributives in a 
grammatical knowledge dictionary. 
It should be pointed out, all the above information of lexical types may regard as 
the principle to construct a grammar knowledge dictionary. No matter how widely an 
item is used or how many its function includes, each item is equal in information. 
That is to say, equal attention should be paid to every lexical item with filling its 
information contents in every field of the dictionary, no matter much or few 
phenomenon of items involve. 
Finally, the source of information attributives of Tibetan grammatical dictionary 
should be mentioned. Generally speaking, all the information of lexical items stem 
from language material or real texts. But the information contents and information 
attributives of each lexical item should be ascertained through the Tibetan 
grammatical system. So, we will take verbs as examples and discuss information 
contents of lexical items in our Tibetan grammatical system, which we call GIDCT (a 
Grammatical Information-Dictionary of Contemporary Tibetan). 
2   Grammatical Features of Verbs 
The most important features of Tibetan verbs embodied three dimensions, the 
morphology, word-formation and syntax. These three dimensions influence each other 
and condition each other. So the relationship and the forms of grammatical 
representation among them need to be ascertained gradually.  
2.1   Morphological Features 
The morphological features only refer to the forms of tense and mood remained from 
the ancient original forms of Tibetan monosyllabic verbs. That is to say, each 
monosyllabic verb may have four forms, the present tense form (also named proto-
form), future tense form, past tense form and imperative mood form. However, the 
paradigm of Tibetan monosyllabic verbs, by no means, only adds the affixes or 
exhibits the regular inflection to construct. From the following examples, we can 
clearly comprehend the morphological conception of Tibetan verbs in table 1. 
Obviously, the paradigm is of irregularity, as is the irregular change of verbs in 
English. It is quite difficult to analogize for this reason. But on the other hand, there 
are amount of Tibetan verbs which never change their forms. Related with the syntax, 
those sentences with prospective aspect markers always use the future tense forms of 
verbs, and sentences with realis markers always use past tense forms. That means 
morphology and syntax restrictively interacts each others. In addition, according to 
H.A.J?schke?s views[3], the present and the future forms always appear together with 
the negative particle ?mi?, and the past and imperative forms with negative particle 
?ma?, which also have influences on the orders words. From the above, we know that 
the morphological features of Tibetan monosyllabic verbs still remain some 
restrictions on the syntactic function in the contemporary Tibetan, though Tibetan 
verbal morphemes are the remains of ancient times.

2.2   Word-Formation Features 
Most of the verbs in contemporary Tibetan are polysyllabic verbs, which appears in 
high frequency, and their meanings trend to be complicated. Tibetan polysyllabic 
verbs have stronger regularity in word-formation. They consist of nouns and verbs or 
adjectives and verbs. Among them, most of the verbal morphemes in compounds are 
common verbs without substantive sense. Please observer the following words in 
table 2.

One of the most important features of compound verbs is formal markers, 
namely, the verbal morphemes within words. Because of the productivity of 
compound verbs, dictionaries always fall behind. So it is possible to resolve the 
problem of recognition of verbs if verbal morphemes be regarded as morphological 
markers and rules of compound word-formation be built up in compounds. 
Taking ngal gso rgyag ?relax? as an example, it is always viewed as a phrase, so 
the compound word and the likes can not enter into A Tibetan-Chinese Dictionary[4]. 
In this case, the segmentation of the word may be ngal-gso/ rgyag with the dictionary, 
in which the former is a noun with meaning ?relaxation?, the latter is a monosyllabic 
verb with not-thorough-going meaning ?doing, making?. The real reason led to such a 
grammatical conception is that many compound verbs can be inserted some other 
grammatical constituents, such as ngal-gso yag-po rgyag ?take a good rest?, ngal-gso 
tog-tsham rgyag ?take a short break?. In our opinion, Tibetan polysyllabic compound 
verbs are still in progress and not yet fall into a pattern in mind. Anyway, when 
 The Verbal Entries and Their Description in a Grammatical Information-Dictionary 877 
engaged in computer processing, we can not give up an undertaking on account of a 
small obstacle. So while we put compound verbs in the dictionary we make some 
other rules to process the verbal phrases with inserted constituents. 
Quite few are another type of common disyllabic compound verbs in Tibetan, 
which are non-productive in word-formation. For instance, ha go ?understand?, kha 
nor ?make an indiscreet remark?, ngo tsha ?be shy?, blo?gel ?trust in?, khas?che 
?promise?, ha las ?amaze?, ya mtshan ?be strange at?. Those words were formed 
from phrases in history and are unmarked forms. So we can put them all into the 
dictionary directly without morphological analysis. 
2.3   Syntactic Features 
The Tibetan verb syntactic features cover many categories. Such as, whether or not 
they take objects, what kind of objects they take, which types of case markers they 
require to subject and object constituents, and so on. On the other hand, The 
attributions of verbs themselves are very important, which determine the quantity of 
arguments and the frame of sentences, such as attribution of human verbs, of volition 
verbs, of controllable verbs, causative verbs, and so on. In addition, some other 
syntactic features are also of importance. e.g. the formal markers of normalization for 
each verb, and the position relationships between verbs and adverbial modifiers and 
so on. 
In our project, an effective way to analysis Tibetan verb syntax has been found 
that is classification for verbs according to the types of syntactic features and 
semantic features of verbs. With this method we can describe those grammatical 
information for each verb and compile verbs into the knowledge dictionary in 
different types. The following are some description of 12 types of verbs.[5]  
Verbs of possession: This type of verbs indicates those which contain the 
meaning ?to possess, to gain, to come being to, to form? and so on. For example, yod 
/dug ?have?, vthob ?gain?, byung/ yong ?take place?, rag ?obtain?, ?dzams ?belong 
to?, ?chor/ shor ?appear, emerge? and so on. The basic format of verbs of possession 
is ?NP+[POS]+NP+V(VOP), which requires that the subjects take possessive case 
markers, and that the objects take absolutive case marker (zero form). So the syntactic 
information items of verbs of possession are like these {V
 (VOP), NP(S)+POS, 
NP(O)+?}. Also, most of the verbs of possession possess the characteristic of 
{HMN}(subjects are human being). 
Existential verb: This type of verbs expresses the meaning of someone or 
something being somewhere. For instance, yod/ ?dug/ yog red ?exist, be?. Existential 
verbs demand the subjects take absolutive case marker, and the objects take locative 
case marker. The basic syntactic format of existential verbs is ?NP+NP+[LOC] 
+VP(EXI)?. Existential verbs and verbs of possession do not obligatorily demand the 
characteristics of {HMN} and {CTR}(subjects can control actions) for subjects. The 
grammatical information items of existential verbs include {V(EXI), NP+LOC}. 
Verbs of change: The verbs of change indicate those which take resultant 
complement constituents. Such as sprul ?change?, sgyur ?make to change?, ?gyur 
?turn to?, ?gro ?change?, ?dul ?domesticate? and so on. The basic format of the verbs 
of change is ?NP+VP(adj/ v)+[COP]+VP(CHA)?. That means verbs of change require 
complements of adjectives or verbal phrases which express the results of verb 
878 D. Jiang, C. Long, and J. Zhang 
changes and there is a complement particle between complement constituents(COP) 
and verbs. So in the information dictionary, the characteristics of {V(CHA), VP+COP} 
should be described.  
Perception verbs: This type of verbs indicates responses and feelings human 
being perceives from things or events by sight, by hearing and by aesthesia. Such as, 
mthong ?see?, go ?hear?, ha go ?understand?, dran ?remember?, brjed ?forget?, ngo 
shes ?recognize? and so on. Perception verbs possess the characteristic of {HMN} 
and {INV}(non-volition). Except of a few words such as brjed ?forget?, the action 
outcome of the perception verbs can not be controlled by human being with 
consciousness. So they are non-controllable verbs. The basic format of the perception 
verbs is ?NP+[AG]+NP+VP(PER)?. That means the subject may take an agentive case 
marker. So the information items in the dictionary are {V(PER), NP(S)+AG, HMN, 
UCT(=non-control)}, but the information items for verbs like brjed ?forget? are 
{V(PER), NP(S)+AG, HMN, CTR}. 
Directional verbs: This type of verbs indicates those which express moving 
action concepts or staying status concepts. The common verbs are ?gro ?go?, phyin 
?go?, yong ?come?, phebs ?come?, bsdad ?stay?, bzhag ?lay up? and so on. The 
directional verbs can construct directional-predicate structure: ?NP+VP(DIR)?, or 
construct directional complement: NP+VP+VP(DIR), in which the verbs are called 
directional constituents, or construct serial verbal phrases: NP+VP+[TAP]+VP(DIR). 
The information items of directional verbs in the dictionary are {V(DIR), VP+V(DIR), 
VP+TAP+VP(DIR)}. There are no obligatory demands on the characteristics of 
{HMN}, {CTR}, or {VOL} for subjects in directional verb structures. 
Cognition verbs: This type of verbs indicates those which express non-action 
psychological activity. The common verbs are brtsi ?jog byed ?respect?, dga? zhen 
byed ?like?, ngo tsha ?be shy?, sems shor ?be infatuated with?, mthong tchung byed 
?belitter?, ngo rgol byed ?be object to?, dogs ?be suspicious of? and so on. The basic 
syntactic structure of the cognition verbs is NP+[AG]+NP +[OBJ]+VP(COG), namely 
the subjects can take agentive case markers, and objects can take objective case 
markers. The information items of cognition verbs is {V(COG), NP(S)+AG, NP(O)+OBJ} 
in the dictionary. 
Narrate verbs: The narrate verbs indicate the verbs expressing the meaning of 
citation and thinking in mind. Such as bshad ?say?, zer ?speak?, ?dri ?ask?, lan slog 
?answer?, bsam ?think?, dgongs ?think over?, shes ?know? and so on. The narrate 
verbs require clausal objects or objects of normalization phrases, the basic structures 
are ?NP+[AG]+[NP+VP]+VP(NAR), or [NP+VP] +NP +[AG]+VP(NAR), in which the 
clausal objects of citation verbs unusually attaches clause particle ?se?. The 
information items of narrate verbs in the dictionary include {V(NAR)}. 
Interrelation verbs: This type of verbs indicates those which interconnect two or 
more things or events on logic, or social rules, or common senses, which correspond 
or subordinate each other. For instance, ?dre ?mix up?, ?gal ?violate?, mthun ?be in 
consensus?, kha bral ?separate?, stun ?fit?, kha thug rgyag ?meet?. The syntactic 
format of the interrelation verbs is NP+NP+[ITP]+VP(REL), namely the interrelation 
verbs need attach an interrelation case marker ?dang? to the nouns related. Therefore 
the information items of interrelation verbs should include {V(REL), NP+ITP}. 
Causative verbs: The causative verbs include the meaning of ?cause to do?, such 
as bcug ?let to do?, byed ?let to do, make sth. appear?, bzo ?make sb. do? and so on. 
 The Verbal Entries and Their Description in a Grammatical Information-Dictionary 879 
Generally, the subjects of causative verbs attach agentive case marker to subjects, and 
sometimes possessive case marker to subjects in object-clause. Usually, there is a 
causative particle ?ru? between the object-clause and the causative verbs. The basic 
syntactic structure of causative verbs are ?NP+[AG]+NP+[POS]+(NP+)VP 
+[CAU]+VP(CAV)?. The information items of causative verbs in the dictionary are 
{V(CAV), NP(S)+AG, NP(PCC)+POS, PCC+CAV}. 
Stative verbs: This type of verbs indicates those which express the state of 
actions. Such as shi ?die?, bzi ?drunk?, snyun ?be ill?, yal ?disappear? and so on. The 
basic syntactic structure of the stative verbs is ?NP+? NP+? VP(STA)?, namely the 
subject and object should be with absolutive case marker. The information items of 
the stative verbs in the dictionary are {V(STA)}. 
Action verbs: Action verbs include several types. Some express the meaning of 
rendering and take two objects, some express the meaning of objects changing and 
take a result object. The objects? types of action verbs include accusative objects, 
indirect objects, resultative objects. The subject of action verbs are often attached an 
agentive case marker. Action verbs can be divided into transitive and intransitive 
verbs. The basic syntactic structure of intransitive action verb is ?NP+VP(ACT)?, and 
that of transitive is ?NP+NP+VP(ACT)?, or that of bi-objects is ?NP+NP+[DAT]+NP 
+VP?, or that of resultative objects is ?NP+[AG]+NP+NP+[FAT]+VP(ACT)?. 
Copula: Copula denotes verbs yin / red ?be? which express the classes of 
grammatical subjects. The basic structure of copula is ?NP+NP+VP(COU)?, namely 
both of the subject and the object use absolutive case marker.[6]  
As space is limited, the above description about verbal syntax and semantics is 
quite simple. We believe more and more grammatical information phenomena will be 
mined out and be collected into grammatical information dictionary one by one in our 
future work. 
3   Descriptions of the Information Items Related to Verbs and 
Some Samples 
In this section, we will describe the information items of verbs which are in our 
GIDCT. For the sake of a clear statement, we will illustrate some representative 
samples as well. 
<Number>, it denotes the order location of a word entry in GIDCT. 
<Word form>, it denotes Tibetan characters (orthography) of written words, e.g. 
 
<Transliteration of Word Form>, it denotes transliteration forms of Tibetan 
words with roman letters according to a scheme designed. E.g. rlung langs. 
<Lhasa pronunciation>, it denotes the phonetic transcription of words according 
to Lhasa pronunciation. E.g. lungf langw or lu?55 la?132. 
<Meaning(Chinese)>, it denotes the basic meaning of entries with Chinese or other 
languages, this sample is ?anger, rage?. 
<Homograph>, it denotes the homographs of entries, namely dividing a 
polysemous word into different words, then giving their other meanings here.  
E.g. ?blow?. 
880 D. Jiang, C. Long, and J. Zhang 
<Variant>, it provides a different entry forms in spelling. There is no variant for 
this sample.  
<Syllabic Numbers of Entries>, There are about 1300 monosyllabic verbs, and 
about 100 disyllabic verbs in Tibetan, which are classic forms. A number of modern 
Tibetan verbs are polysyllable with a noun and a monosyllabic verb, which shows the 
value and importance of the syllabic numbers in computer processing. This sample is 
a two syllabic verb. 
<Types of word-formation>, it let choose one item from the four: mono-
morphemic words, non-productive compounds, productive compounds, reduplicative 
compounds. Mono-morphemic verbs are monosyllabic verbs; non-productive 
compound verbs are classic disyllables, both of which are unmarked. Compound 
verbs are polysyllabic verbs with verbs serving as markers. Reduplicative compound 
verbs are too complicated, which have been discussed in another paper.[7] For this 
sample, word-formation type is a non-productive compound. 
<Word-formation structure>, it let choose one from types of subject-predicate, 
predicate-object (verb-object), modifier-head, complement-verb, and co-ordination 
constituents. Different structures of word-formation of compound verbs have effects 
on syntactic structures in processing, as in the case of compound verbs with 
accusative objects. In the format of ?noun +noun+ (monosyllabic)verb? (namely: 
N1+N2+V), the ?N1? may be an object of compound verb ?N2+V?, or a part of the 
compound verb. On the other, the difference of the inner structure of compound verbs 
may cause different object types. Such as, the subject-predicate compound verbs 
usually require accusative objects with zero marker, and verbs of predicate-object 
type generally require objective objects with objective marker. Therefore, the inner 
structural relationship of compound verbs may produce influence on the objects and 
their types.[8] This sample is a non-productive compound verb. 
<Word-formation productivity>, it denotes the ability of monosyllabic verbs 
serving as verbal morpheme in word-formation. The chosen items are strong one, 
weak one, and null. E.g., classic disyllabic compound verbs possess no capability of 
combining new-type compound verbs, which are null. The sample is null. 
<Classic Tense form>, it denotes the forms of classic monosyllabic verbs, some 
of which show different forms survived from old time. One of the four forms can be 
chosen from present form, past form, future form, and imperative form. The sample is 
present form. 
<Formative structure>, it denotes the reduplicative form of verbs only. The 
sample is not reduplicative form. 
<Root>, it let write down directly the transliteration forms of verb root or stem. 
The sample is ?rlung?. 
<Meaning of verb root 1>, it let write down directly the meaning in Chinese or 
other language.  The sample is ?air, wind?.  
<Meaning of verb root 2>, it let write down directly the meaning in Chinese or 
other language. The sample is null. 
<Word-formation or formative morpheme>, it let write down the transliteration 
form of word-formation morpheme. The sample is ?langs?. 
<Meaning of word-formation or formative morpheme>, it let write down the 
meaning of the word-formation or formative morpheme. The sample is ?happen?. 
 The Verbal Entries and Their Description in a Grammatical Information-Dictionary 881 
<Honorific form>, it let write down the honorific forms of some verbs. The 
sample is null. 
<Parts of Speech>, it defines parts of speech of every verb entry, in which there 
are two main types: transitive and intransitive. The sample is transitive one. 
<Verbal Types of syntax and semantics>, it defines the syntactic and semantic 
types of verbs, and choose one from following: stative verb, action verb, cognition 
verb, perception verb, verb of change, directional verb, narrate verb, copula, verb of 
possession, existential verb, interrelation verb, causative verb. The sample is 
cognition verb.  
<Person>, it denotes the agreement between person and copula verbs or 
existential verbs. The sample is null. 
<HMN/UMN>, it denotes whether a verb is a human verb or not. The sample is 
HMN. 
<CTR/NTR>, it denotes whether a verb is a controllable verb or not. The sample 
is CTR. 
<VOL/NOL>, it denotes whether a verb is a volitional verb or non-volitional 
verb. The sample is volitional verb. 
<CAV/NAV>, it denotes whether a verb is a causative or non-causative verb. 
The sample is NAV. 
<Subject case type>, it denotes what type of case markers the verb requires for a 
subject (including absolutive /agentive/ possessive). The sample is agentive (AG).  
<Object case type>, it denotes what type of case markers the verb requires for 
object (including accusative / objective / resultative). The sample is objective one. 
<Indirect object case type>, it denotes what type of case markers the verb 
requires for indirect objects. The sample is null. 
<Cases for noun phrases>, it denotes what type of case markers the verb 
demands for specific noun phrases (including locative, ablative, allative, instrumental, 
comparative, exclusive, genitive, factitive and so on).  
<Argument value>, it denotes the quantity of arguments the verb refers to. The 
sample is 2.  
<Negative form and the position>, it let choose one from the two negative forms 
(mi, ma), and ascertain the distributing position in verb phrases, before verbs, or 
following verbs, or between syllables of verbs. The sample is between two syllables. 
<Normalization marker>, it let write down the form of normalization markers of 
the verb. The sample is ?mkhan, dus?. 
As to the examples, it is better to collect one or more phrases or clauses as 
examples from real texts, which can illustrate morphological or syntactic 
phenomenon. 
<Example>, sku rlung ma gnang          ?Don?t be angry.? (honorific) 
pha-ma-s    nga-r     rlung-langs-song.  ?My parents are angry with me.? 
parents-AG  me-OBJ angry-PEF(perfect aspect) 
The following are two verbal examples. ?#? denotes this item is null, and ??? 
denotes the function may exists.

4   Conclusions and the Problems to Be Solved 
The data in this project is in construction. Although the data bulk is still not large, 
some special problems of data has appeared which are somewhat difficult to enter 
GIDCT base. For instance, ngal rtsol byed gi yod mdog mdog byed ?to pretend to 
work?, in which mdog originally means ?color?, after being reduplicated, it means 
?false appearance?. But it can not be used alone, it is the same with the verb form of 
mdog mdog byed which is constructed by reduplicating form plus verb form. And its 
object is always a clause (e.g. grwa pa yin mdog mdog byed ?pretend to be a lama?) 
or a verb phrase (e.g. mi shes pa shes mdog mdog byed ?pretend to know when one 
does not know?). There is not any markers between the verb and clause-objects or 
verb-phrase-objects. Obviously, when processing this kind of forms, we should add 
some new information items of morphology to the dictionary, such as verbal bound 
forms or non-absolute verb phrase structures. In addition, some scattered phenomenon 
can not be overlooked, because as information items of the dictionary, they are of the 
same value. 
Professor Yu Shiwen has made very careful annotation for Chinese word items in 
The Grammatical Knowledge-base of Contemporary Chinese.[9] By contrast, GIDCT 
is impossible to reach such depth for the time being. There are many reasons, but the 
essential one is still lack of extensive and thorough researches on grammatical 
infrastructures. On the other hand, Tibetan language information processing is quite 
different from Chinese, it is not suitable to make a dictionary by copying the 
description method of Chinese grammar simply. Take Chinese resultative verbs for an 
example, this type of verbs always extend to syntactic resultative phrases, such as ?
?  (remember-fixed) ?remember? to ? ? ?  (remember-able-fixed) ?able to 
remember?. Yet the type of verbs only contains some of Chinese verbs, so it is worth 
to list their information in the dictionary. For Tibetan polysyllabic compound verbs, 
nearly all of them can accept modifiers or complements between nominal and verbal 
morphemes, it is difficult to compile them or describe them in the dictionary. 
In true texts, there are close connection among verbs and other constituents, 
especially predicate endings, including aspect markers, evidential markers and mood 
markers. But these information may list separately in GIDCT, which is quite different 
from Yu?s GKBCC, in which Chinese ??zhuo, ?le, ?guo? are listed as verbs? 
information items.[10] Also, some other information, such as information of verbs 
884 D. Jiang, C. Long, and J. Zhang 
modified by adverbs and of the relations with auxiliary verbs, etc, have not yet been 
described in GIDCT temporarily. All in all, it will be an important task to mine 
information as much as possible in Tibetan grammatical information dictionary 
construction. 
Now the infrastructure of languages and construction of electronic dictionaries 
has been attached more and more great importance to, including classifying syntax 
dictionary and semantic dictionary.[11][12] The GIDCT is also a good beginning to 
Tibetan natural language processing.
