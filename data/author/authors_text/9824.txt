Abstract
We present the Tamajaq language and the dic-
tionary we used as main linguistic resource in 
the two first  parts.  The third part  details  the 
complex morphology of this language. In the 
part 4 we describe the conversion of the dictio-
nary into electronic form, the inflectional rules 
we wrote and their implementation in the Nooj 
software. Finally we present a plan for our fu-
ture work.
1. The Tamajaq language
1.1 Socio-linguistic situation
In  Niger,  the  official  language  is  French  and 
there  are  eleven  national  languages.  Five  are 
taught  in  a  experimental  schools:  Fulfulde, 
Hausa, Kanuri, Tamajaq and So?ay-Zarma. 
According to the last census in 1998, the Tama-
jaq language is spoken by 8,4% of the 13.5 mil-
lion people who live in Niger. This language is 
also spoken in Mali, Burkina-Faso, Algeria and 
Libya. It is estimated there are around 5 millions 
Tamajaq-speakers around the world.
The Tamacheq language belongs to the group of 
Berber languages.
1.2 Tamajaq alphabet
The Tamajaq alphabet used in Niger (Republic 
of Niger, 1999) uses 41 characters, 14 with dia-
critical marks that all figure in the Unicode stan-
dard (See appendix A). There are 12 vowels: a, ?, 
?, ?, e, ?, i, ?, o, ?, u, ?.

1.4 Tools on computers
There are no specific TALN tools for the Tama-
jaq language. 
However  characters  can  be  easily  typed  on 
French keyboards thanks to the AFRO keyboard 
layout (Enguehard and al. 2008).
2 Lexicographic resources
We use the school editorial dictionary "diction-
naire Tamajaq-fran?ais destin? ? l'enseignement 
du  cycle  de  base  1".   It  was  written  by  the 
SOUTEBA1 project of the DED2 organisation in 
2006. Because it targets children, this dictionary 
consists only of 5,390 entries. Words have been 
chosen by compiling school books.
2.1 Structure of an entry
Each entry generally details :
- lemma,
- lexical category,
- translation in French,
- an example,
- gender (for nouns),
- plural form (for nouns).
Examples: 
? ?bada1: sn. bas ventre. Daw t?dist. B?rar wa 
y?ll???n  ad  t-y?lt??  ?bada-net.  t?must.:  yy. 
ig?t: ibadan. ? 
? ?bada2:  sn.  flanc.  Tas?ga  me?  daw ?d?g 
?yy?n.  Im?ww??la  ?kl?n  d??  ?bada  n 
?ka?war.  Anammelu.:  azador.  t?must.:  yy. 
?s?fs?s.: ?. Ig?t: ibadan. ? 
Homonyms are described in different entries and 
followed by a number, as in the above example.
2.2 Lexical categories
The linguistic  terms  used in  the  dictionary are 
written in the Tamajaq language using the abbre-

viations presented in table 2. In addition, this ta-
ble gives information about the number of entries 
of each lexical category.

Table 2: Tamajaq lexical categories
3 Morphology
The Tamajaq language presents a rich morpholo-
gy (Aghali-Zakara, 1996).
3.1 Verbal morphology
Verbs are classified according to the number of 
consonants of their lexical root and then in dif-
ferent types. There are monoliteral, biliteral trilit-
eral, quadriliteral verbs...
Three moods are distinguished: imperative, sim-
ple injunctive and  intense injunctive. 
Three aspects present different possible values:
- accomplished: intense or negative;
82
- non accomplished: simple, intense or negative;
- aorist  future: simple or negative.
Examples :
?kt?b (to write): triliteral verb, type 1.
????n (to know): triliteral verb, type 2 (??n).
?m?l (to say): biliteral verb, type 1
ak?r (to steal): biliteral verb, type 2
aw?y (to carry): biliteral verb, type 3
a?wu (to drink): biliteral verb, type 4
aru (to love): monoliteral verb, type 2
aru (to open): monoliteral verb, type 3
Each class of verb has its own rules of conjuga-
tion. 
3.2 Nominal morphology  
a. Simple nouns
Nouns present three characteristics:
- gender: masculine or feminine;
- number: singular or plural;
- annexation state is marked by the change of the 
first vowel. 
Terminology Abbreviation
t?must gender tmt.
yey masculine yy.
t?nte feminine tnt.
awd?kki singular wdk. 
iget plural gt.
?s?fs?s annexation 
state
sfss. 
Table 3: Tamajaq terminology for nouns
Example : 
? a?r?kka: sn. morceau de sucre. Akku: abl?? 
n?2.   t?must.:  yy.  ?s?fs?s.:  ?.  Ig?t: 
??r?kkat?n. ?
"a?r?kka"  is  a  masculine  noun.  Its  plural  is 
"??r?kkat?n".  It  becomes  "??r?kka"  when 
annexation state is expressed.
The plural form of nouns is not regular and has 
to be specifically listed.
b. Complex nouns
Complex nouns are composed by several lexical 
units connected together by hyphens. It could in-
clude nouns, determiners or prepositions as well 
as verbs.
Examples:
Noun +determiner + noun
"eja?-n-?j?an", literally means "donkey of 
birds" (this is the name of a bird).
Verb + noun
"aw?y-?hu?"  literally  means  "it  follows 
harmattan" (kite).
"ga??ay-t?fuk" literally means "it looks at 
sun" (sunflower).
Preposition + noun
"In-tama?" means "the one of the tree aca-
cia"  (of acacia).
Verb + verb
"az?l-az?l" means "run run"  (return).
We counted 238 complex nouns in the studied 
dictionary.
4 Natural  Language  Processing  of 
Tamajaq
4.1 Nooj software (Silberztein, 2007)
? Nooj is a linguistic development environment 
that includes tools to create and maintain large-
coverage lexical  resources,  as  well  as  morpho-
logical and syntactic grammars. ? This software 
is specifically designed for linguists who can use 
it to test hypothesis on real corpus. ? Dictionaries 
and grammars are applied to texts in order to lo-
cate morphological, lexical and syntactic patterns 
and tag simple and compound words. ? Nooj put 
all possible tags for each token or group of to-
kens but does not disambiguate between the mul-
tiple  possibilities.  However,  the  user  can  build 
his own grammar to choose between the multiple 
possible tags. The analysis can be displayed as a 
syntactic tree. 
This software is supported by Windows.
We chose to construct resources for this software 
because it is fully compatible with Unicode.
4.2 Construction of the dictionary
We convert  the  edited  dictionary  for  the  Nooj 
software.
3,463 simple nouns, 128 complex nouns, 46 ad-
jectives and 33 verbo-nouns are given with their 
plural form. Annexation state is indicated for 987 
83
nouns, 23 complex nouns, 2 adjectives and 7 ver-
bo-nouns.
We  created  morphological  rules  that  we  ex-
pressed as Perl  regular  expressions and also in 
the Nooj format (with the associated tag).
a. Annexation state rules 
Thirteen  morphological  rules  calculate  the  an-
nexation state.
Examples:
The 'A1?' rule replaces the first letter of the 
word by '?'.
'A1?' rule
Nooj <LW><S>?/sfss
Perl ^.(.*)$ ? ?$1
Table 4: Rule 'A1?'
The 'A2 '  rule  replaces  the  second letter  of?  
the word by ' '.?
'A2 ' rule?
Nooj A2 =<LW><R><S> /sfss? ?
Perl ^(.).(.*)$ ? $1 $2?
Table 5: Rule 'A2 '?
b.  Plural form rules
We searched formal rules to unify the calculation 
of plural forms. We found 126 rules that fit from 
2 up to 446 words. 2932 words could be associat-
ed with, at least, one flexional rule.
Examples:
'I4' rule deletes the last letter, adds "-?n" at 
the end and "i-" at the beginning.
Nooj I4=?n<LW><S>i/Iget
Perl ^(.*).$ ? i$1?n
# 446 words
Table 6: Rule 'I4'
'I2' rule deletes the last and the second letters 
and includes "-en" at the end and "-i-" in the 
second position.
Nooj I2=<B>en<LW><R><S>i/Iget
Perl ^(.).(.*).$ ? $1i$2en
# 144 words
Table 7: Rule 'I2'
'I45'  rule deletes the final letter and include 
"-en" at the end. 
Nooj I45=<B>en/Iget
Perl ^(.*).$ ? <B>en/Iget
# 78 words
Table 8: Rule 'I45'
'I102'  rule deletes the two last letters and the 
second one and includes a final "-a" and a 
"-i-" in the second position.
Nooj I102=<B2>a<LW><R><S>i/Iget
Perl ^(.).(.*)..$ ? $1i$2a
# 6 words
Table 9: Rule 'I102'
c.  Combined rules
When  it  was  necessary,  the  above  rules  have 
been combined to  calculate  singular  and plural 
forms with or without annexation state.
We thus finally obtained 319 rules.
Example:
I2RA2? = 
:Rwdk + :I2 + :Rwdk :A2? + :I2 :A2?
Fig. 1: Rule I2RA2?
This  rule  recognizes  the  singular  form 
(:Rwdk),  the  plural  form  (:I2),  the  singular 
form with the annexation state (:Rwdk :A2?) 
and  the plural form with the annexation state 
(:I2 :A2?).
25 words meet this rule. 
For  instance,  "ta?l?mt"  (accusation,  provoca-
tion), is inflected in: 
- ta?l?mt,ta?l?mt,SN+tnt+wdk
- ti?l?men,ta?l?mt,SN+tnt+Iget
- t??l?men,ta?l?mt,SN+tnt+Iget+sfss
84
- t??l?mt,ta?l?mt,SN+tnt+wdk+sfss
d. Conjugaison rules
Verb classes are not indicated in the dictionary. 
We only describe a few conjugaison rules, just to 
check the expressivity of the Nooj software
Here is the rule of the verb "????n" (to know), 
intense  accomplished  aspect,  represented  as  a 
transducer. 
Fig. 2: Verb "????n",  intense accomplished aspect
We obtain, in the inflected dictionary, the correct 
conjugated forms.
???ana?+????n,V+accompli+wdk+1 
t???ana?+????n,V+accompli+wdk+2
i??an+????n,V+accompli+wdk+yy+3 
t???an+????n,V+accompli+wdk+tnt+3 
n???an+????n,V+accompli+gt+1 
t???anam+????n,V+accompli+gt+yy+2 
t???anmat+????n,V+accompli+gt+tnt+2 
???anan+????n,V+accompli+gt+yy+3
???annat+????n,V+accompli+gt+tnt+3
e. Irregular words
Finally,  the singular  and plural  forms  of  2,457 
words were explicitly written in the Nooj dictio-
nary because they do not follow any regular rule.
Examples:
Singular Plural Translation
ag-awnaf kel-awnaf tourist
aman o? imen a? young animal
?naffare??i in ff r ??a? ? ? someboby with 
bad mood
?nesbehu in sbuha? liar
efange ifang?yan bank
efajanf?j ifajanf? ?n? sling
emag?rm?z imag?m?z?n plant
emazz?le imazzalet?n singer
ta aggalt? ti ulen? daugther-in-
law
tej?? tiz en? goal (football) 
Table 10: Examples of irregular plural forms
f. Result
There are 6,378 entries in the Nooj dictionary. 
The  inflected  dictionary,  calculated  from  the 
above  dictionary  and  with  the  inflectional  and 
conjugation rules, encounters 11,223 entries.
Nooj  is  able  to  use  the  electronic  dictionary 
we've created to automatically tag a text (see an 
example in appendix B).
4.3 Future work
a Conversion into XML format
We will  convert the inflectional dictionary into 
the  international  standard  Lexical  Markup 
Framework format  (Francopoulo and al.,  2006) 
in order to make it easily usable by other TALN 
application,.
b Automatic search of rules
Due to the high morphological complexity of the 
Tamajaq  language,  we  plan  to  develop  a  Perl 
program that would automatically determine the 
derivational and conjugation rules.
c Completion and correction of the resource
The linguistic resource will be completed during 
the next months in order to add the class of verbs 
that are absent for the moment, and also to cor-
rect the errors that we noticed during this study.
d Enrichment of the resource
We plan to construct a corpus of school texts to 
evaluate the out-of-vocabulary rate of this dictio-
nary.  This corpus could then be used to enrich 
the  dictionary.  The  information  given  by Nooj 
would be useful to choose the words to add.

APPENDIX B : Nooj tagging Tamajaq text
Nooj perfectly recognizes the four forms of the 
word "aw?qqas" (big cat) in the text:
"aw?qqas,  iwa?san, awa?san"
These forms are listed in the inflectional dictio-
nary as:
aw?qqas,aw?qqas,SN+yy+wdk
aw?qqas,aw?qqas,SN+yy+wdk+FLX=A1a+sfss
iwa?san,aw?qqas,SN+yy+iget
awa?san,aw?qqas,SN+yy+iget+FLX=A1a+sfss
Fig.3: Tags on the text "aw?qqas, iwa san,?  awa san"?
On the figure 3, we can see that the first token 
"aw?qqas" gets two tags: 
- "aw?qqas,SN+yy+wdk" (singular)
- "aw?qqas,SN+yy+wdk+sfss"  (singular  and 
annexation state).
The  second  and  third  tokens  get  a  unique  tag 
because there is no ambiguity.
