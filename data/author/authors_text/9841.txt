Abstract. Corpus-based stochastic language models have achieved significant 
success in speech recognition, but construction of a corpus pertaining to a 
specific application is a difficult task. This paper introduces a Case-Based 
Reasoning system to generate natural language corpora. In comparison to 
traditional natural language generation approaches, this system overcomes the 
inflexibility of template-based methods while avoiding the linguistic 
sophistication of rule-based packages. The evaluation of the system indicates 
our approach is effective in generating users? specifications or queries as 98% 
of the generated sentences are grammatically correct. The study result also 
shows that the language model derived from the generated corpus can 
significantly outperform a general language model or a dictation grammar.  
1   Introduction 
Stochastic language models have achieved significant success in speech recognition 
since the last decade [1, 2]. The main underlying technique in stochastic approaches is 
the use of corpora. The successful utilization of corpora has been proven by many 
researchers [3,4,5]. However, construction of a corpus pertaining to a specific 
application is a difficult task, given that there is no pre-knowledge on how users 
might communicate with the application before the deployment of a system. Research 
[6] has been conducted to explore the effectiveness of Web-based text corpus 
generation. Although the proliferation of eText has made the collection of textual 
material easier than ever, Thompson [7] argues that actually locating eText 
appropriate to your needs can be quite difficult. Moreover, in the context of 
conversational systems, the suitability of corpora purely collected from the Internet is 
controversial due to the difference of written text and spoken language. 
Although generally there is a lack of spoken material pertaining to a new 
application, ample transcriptions do exist in some well-established domains, such as 
the Air Traffic Information System (ATIS) domain. User modeling has been studied 
for long and conversations between users and agents of spoken language systems 
have been recorded and accumulated for decades in these domains. In our project, we 
seek to develop a speech-enabled mobile commerce application, which we called the 
MCCS (Mobile Car City system). The system allows a mobile-phone user to specify 
preferences or initiate queries by speech at the beginning of the conversation. Then all 
994 Y. Fan and E. Kendall 
car models conforming to the preferences or queries are retrieved to guide the user in 
finding specific car models that meet his/her needs. Through carefully examining the 
spoken transcriptions from the ATIS domain, we believe that user specifications or 
queries in the MCCS system should share significant similarity in sentence syntactic 
structure with their counterparts in the ATIS domain. Motivated by this assumption, 
we believe that the MCCS system can learn a set of sample sentences from the ATIS 
domain, which can then be used as the knowledge base for case-based reasoning 
(CBR) to generate a speech corpus pertaining to the MCCS domain. 
NLG (Natural Language Generation) research has been dominated by two 
approaches in the past three decades: template-based and rule-based [8, 9]. Some 
claim that template-based approaches are not flexible enough while others criticize 
the sophistication of linguistic grammars implemented in rule-based approaches [8].  
A new strand in the arena is learning-based NLG, in which the objective is to learn 
the mapping from semantics to surface realization through sample sentences. 
Research [10, 11, 12] suggests that learning-based approaches can balance the 
inflexibility of template-based methods and the linguistic sophistication of rule-based 
NLG packages when developing domain-specific generation systems.  
In this paper, we explore an incremental learning approach for speech corpus 
generation. Firstly, a set of sample sentences pertaining to user specifications or 
queries in the MCCS application are learnt from the ATIS domain. Secondly, a CBR 
system is built to generate a corpus based on those sample sentences. Finally, an n-
gram language model is derived from the corpus by learning the statistical distribution 
of tokens. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the general 
structure of the corpus generation system. Detailed implementation of the system is 
described through Section 3-5. Section 6 presents the evaluation results of the 
generated corpus. Related work is discussed in Section 7. We conclude the study and 
briefly discuss potential future work in Section 8. 
2   System Overview 
Our aim is to develop a case-based, domain-specific generation system that can 
significantly reduce complexity in comparison to rule-based solutions. Case-based 
reasoning (CBR) systems have long been applied for problem solving in many areas, 
such as classification, diagnosis, configuration and design, and planning, but only 
recently has it attracted significant attention from researchers in NLG. Like any other 
CBR system, a CBR-based NLG system has to include the following components: 
? Sample sentence set (Case Base) 
? Schema for sentence structure, includes semantic and syntactic (Knowledge 
Representation) 
? Similarity measurement (Acceptance Function) 
? Sentence generation (Case Retrieval and adaptation algorithms) 
Figure 1 represents the overall structure of our CBR-based corpus generation 
system. The system implements a pipeline architecture consisting of three stages. 
Firstly, an initial sample sentence set is created manually to integrate an ATIS 
sentence base (ASB) and a MCCS phrasal base (MPB). The ASB is a collection of 
 A Case-Based Reasoning Approach for Speech Corpus Generation 995 
sentences from a well-established corpus in the ATIS domain. The MPB collects 
phrases in describing car model features, which are abstracted from car 
manufacturers? websites and marketing brochures. Through careful analysis on the 
sentences in the ASB and the phrases in the MPB, sample sentences for user queries 
or specifications pertaining to the MCCS system can be created to form a case 
sentence base (CSB). The examples (2.1)-(2.3) show an ATIS sentence from the 
ASB, a MCCS phrase from the MPB, and a sample sentence from the CSB, 
respectively.  
I prefer [PluralObject flights] [ServiceFeature serve lunch] (2.1) 
[SingularObject A car] with [NumOfDoorFeature four doors] (2.2) 
I prefer cars with four doors. (2.3) 
Secondly, these sample sentences in the CSB are annotated to abstract semantic 
structure and corresponding syntactic structure, which become the case representation 
for instance learning. Finally, based on the understanding of the characteristics of user 
queries and specifications, a new input that represents a unique semantic meaning 
passes through the CBR system. The similarity between the input and a case is 
calculated and examined. If the distance is within the predefined threshold, adaptation 
is conducted to generate a new syntactic structure for the semantic input. This 
procedure is continuously performed until all possible inputs are enumerated. The 
resultant corpus is then ready for creating an n-gram language model. 
 
Fig. 1. Main procedures of the CBR-based corpus generation system 
3   Sample Sentence Set 
We collect utterances pertaining to user preference specifications or queries from the 
ATIS domain. The utterances are classified into four categories [13] according to their 
sentence acts. The followings are examples for each category: 
Sample Sentence Creation 
? Build up the sample sentence set
Case Sentence Annotation 
? Implement the schema for representing the semantic and syntactic 
structure of sample sentences 
Corpus Generation 
? Retrieve cases from the set 
? Calculate the distance between a new input and a case 
? Perform adaptation to generate new sentences 
996 Y. Fan and E. Kendall 
  Declarative: I prefer a [TimeFeature morning] [SingularObject flight]. (3.1) 
  Imperative: Show me the [PriceFeature cheapest] [SingularObject flight]. (3.2) 
  Yes-no-question: Can you give me some information for [Carrier United]? (3.3) 
  Wh-question: What [PluralObject flights] [ServeFeature serve breakfast] 
and [HaveFeature have stops]? (3.4) 
Each sentence in the ASB has been annotated by assigning conceptual categories 
[14] to domain concepts reflecting semantic meanings. Such simple annotations can 
help us create sample sentences in the MCCS domain by substituting or adjoining 
operations. The examples (3.5)-(3.8) show the corresponding cases in the CSB rooted 
from (3.1)-(3.4). There are in total 114 cases in the CSB. 
  Declarative: I prefer a white car. (3.5) 
  Imperative: Show me the cheapest sedan. (3.6) 
  Yes-no-question: Can you give me some information for Honda? (3.7) 
  Wh-question: What cars can seat more than 5 passengers and have 4 doors? (3.8) 
4   Case Sentence Annotation 
In our corpus generation system, we implement an annotation scheme for sample 
sentences in the CSB. Each sample sentence is annotated in two plies. The first ply is 
the semantic structure representing the domain concept relationships. The syntactic 
structure is abstracted in the second ply to reflect surface realization. 
QueryObject   CAT_Color  CAT_NumOfDoor 
CAT_NumOfCylinder  CAT_Make  CAT_BodyStyle 
CAT_Transmission  CAT_DriveWheel 
NUM_MadeYearStartValue NUM_MadeYearEndValue 
NUM_EngineLiterStartValue NUM_EngineLiterEndValue 
NUM_PriceStartValue  NUM_PriceEndValue 
NUM_NumOfPassengerStartValue NUM_NumOfPassengerEndValue 
Note: CAT means categorical feature while NUM means numeric feature 
Fig. 2. Conceptual category set 
We utilize a set of conceptual categories to abstract conceptual meanings in our 
application domain (Figure 2). The benefit of introducing conceptual categories is that 
each concept in a case sentence can be instantiated with different values to satisfy 
word coverage. The semantic ply indicates the sentence act and the number type 
(singular or plural) of the query object. It also catches the relations between those 
conceptual categories involved in the annotated sentence. For instance, the semantic 
ply of Example (3.8) can be described in a Query Language [15] as: 
 A Case-Based Reasoning Approach for Speech Corpus Generation 997 
    {x|x.Act=?wh-question? ? x.QueryObject=?car? ? x.ObjectType=?Plural? ? 
car.NumOfDoor=?four? ? car.NumOfPassenger.StartValue=5 }  (4.1) 
The syntactic ply analyzes the syntactic structure of the sentence, which is the 
formalism for surface realization. The structure of the formalism is adapted from the 
systemic functional grammar [16], which consists of three layers: clause, phrase and 
token. Figure 3 represents the syntactic structure of the example (3.8). 
<SynStructure type=?ComplexClause?> 
 <SynClause localID=?c1?> 
<SynPhrase type=?Simple? fc=?CannedText? value=?What? /> 
<SynPhrase type=?Simple? fc=?ObjectThing? ref=?Head? value=?VALUE? /> 
<SynPhrase type=?Simple? fc=?Predicate? value=?can seat? /> 
<SynPhrase type=?Complex? fc=?NUMFeature? ref=?NumOfPassenger?> 
  <SynToken type=?Simple? fc=?CannedText? value=?more than? /> 
  <SynToken type=?Simple? fc=?Feature? value=?StartValue? /> 
  <SynToken type=?Simple? fc=?Quantifier? value=?passengers? /> 
</SynPhrase> 
<SynPhrase type=?Simple? fc=?PredicateConj? value=?and? /> 
<SynPhrase type=?Simple? fc=?Predicate? value=?have? /> 
<SynPhrase type=?Complex? fc=?CATFeature? ref=?NumOfDoor? /> 
  <SynToken type=?Simple? fc=?Feature? value=?VALUE? /> 
  <SynToken type=?Simple? fc=?Quantifier? value=?doors? /> 
</SynPhrase> 
 </SynClause> 
</SynStructure>

5   Corpus Generation 
The general principles for creating a corpus are semantic coverage, syntactic 
coverage, prosodic coverage and word coverage [11]. As the target outcome of our 
system is a sentence corpus for language modeling, prosodic coverage is not our 
focus. 
? Semantic coverage: the corpus should cover domain concepts and relationships as 
completely as possible; 
? Syntactic Coverage: the corpus should reflect many rich syntactic variations, as 
found in natural language; 
? Word Coverage: the corpus should cover as many words as possible in the 
vocabulary. 
In this Section, we demonstrate how these three principles have been considered and 
satisfied during the corpus generation. Although case sentences marked with domain-
specific conceptual categories can be used directly for surface natural language 
generation, as was suggested in [17], it is only capable of handling certain 
circumstances, such as simple applications (as the NLG1 in [17]) or under the 
assumption that the corpus is large enough for statistical analysis (as the NLG2 and 
NLG3 in [17]). In our project, we seek to create a corpus based on a sample sentence 
set with a limited size. Therefore, a CBR approach with adaptability is more 
998 Y. Fan and E. Kendall 
appropriate [11]. An input to the sentence generator is a semantic structure represented 
in an AVM (attribute value matrix) form, including a sentence act, the query object and 
its features.  Figure 4 shows a typical example of inputs. 
      Act:  declarative 
       Object:   head: car 
                       number: singular 
        
        Feature:      
                       color: red 
                       num_of_door: 4 
                       body_style: sedan 
Fig. 4. An example input showing the semantic meaning of a user?s specification: ?I would 
prefer a red sedan with four doors? 
In order to satisfy the semantic coverage, we explore all possible combinations of 
features related to the car object. We made a decision to include only those 
combinations with less than 5 features so that the generated sentence can be kept in a 
reasonable length. In terms of syntactic coverage, we consider all sentence acts to 
express a feature combination. In addition, the variations of syntax in describing a 
numeric feature are explored. The examples (5.1)-(5.4) show four types of phrases 
with different foci to specify the price of a car. The word coverage is achieved 
through enumerating all possible values of each feature. 
  a price no less than [PriceStartValue 15,000] dollars (5.1) 
  a price no more than [PriceEndValue 30,000] dollars (5.2) 
  a price from [PriceStartValue 15,000] to [PriceEndValue 30,000] dollars (5.3) 
  a price around [PriceStartValue=PriceEndValue 20,000] dollars (5.4) 
The generation of sentences is performed according to a procedural algorithm. The 
algorithm consists of four procedures: 
? Distance measuring: An input is compared with the semantic representation of an 
instance in the CSB. Candidates above the threshold are selected for further 
processing. 
? Feature categorizing: Through examining the difference between the feature set of 
the input and that of the case, features are categorized into four groups: 
OldFeatures, AdjustFeatures, OtioseFeatures and NewFeatures. Old features are 
those shared by the input and the case. Adjust features are those numeric features 
belonging to both but with different focuses. Features in the case but not in the 
input are called otiose features, and new features are those that appeared in the 
input but not in the case.

Sentence Generation Algorithm 
Input: The semantic structure of a new sentence: I ; 
       An instance of cases retrieved from the sentence base: C; 
Output: a generated sentence if it?s successful; otherwise null. 
1. If (I.act == C.act) then proceed to 2; 
2. If ( isCompatible (I.object, C.object)) then proceed to 3; 
3. Calculate Dis (I, C); 
  
Denote I (F) as the input, where F={F1,F2,..Fn} represents the feature set  
of the input. 
Denote C (A) as the case, where A={A1,A2,?Am} represents the feature 
 set of the case. 
Denote k as the number of features ? F? A. 
If we define: 
   ?    if fi ?C 
d (fi, C)  =                
               ?    if fi ? C 
 
   ?    if ai ?F 
d (ai, F)  =               
?     if ai ? F 
 
then Dis (I, C) =? d (fi, C)  + ? d (ai, F) = 2?k + (n-k) ? + (m-k) ?  
The distance function (metric) should satisfy the following conditions: 
(1) 0 ? Dis (I,C) ? 1; 
(2) if n=m=k then Dis (I,C)=0; 
(3) if k=0 then Dis (I, C) =1; 
(4) ? > ? > 0, given that insertion is a more difficult operation 
 than deletion; 
Thus ?=0; 
  1/(m+n) <? < 1/n; 
       and  ? = (1-n?)/m . 
Choose ? = 1/(n+1) then Dis (I, C) = (n-k)*(1/(n+1)) + (m-k)*(1/(n+1))/m 
 
 
4. If (Dis(I,C) <0.5) then proceed to 5; 
5. For each feature fi?{oldFeatures||adjustFeatures}=F?A, perform value substitution 
     or adjustment operation; 
For each feature fj?{otioseFeatures}=(F?A)?F, perform deletion operation; 
For each feature fk?{newFeatures}=(F?A)?A , perform insertion operation.  
6. Surface realize the sentence according to the adaptive syntactic structure.

? Case adapting: For each type of features, different adaptations to the case are 
performed to generate a syntactic structure corresponding to the semantic structure 
of the input. 
? Surface realizing: A sentence is generated according to the adapted syntactic 
structure. 
Figure 5 depicts the details of the sentence generation algorithm. 
6   Evaluation 
The evaluation is done at two levels. Firstly, the generated sentences are scored by 
human evaluators using three ratings: no grammatical error, minor grammatical error 
and major grammatical error. The ratios generally represent the quality of sentence 
generation. Secondly, the generated corpus is divided into two sets: a training set and 
a test set. We use the training set to build an n-gram language model. The language 
model is applied to a speech recognition engine to test recognition effectiveness. The 
sentences from the test set are used for this testing. We measure the word error rate to 
verify the acceptability of the language model.

Two hundred sentences are randomly selected from the generated corpus for 
grammatical evaluation. Of these sentences, 196 sentences are grammatically correct. 
Three sentences have major grammatical errors and one has minor error. The 
effectiveness of the system in generating user specifications and queries is supported 
 A Case-Based Reasoning Approach for Speech Corpus Generation 1001 
by the high percentage of correctness. We then follow the methods introduced in [1] 
to test the performance of the language model derived from the corpus. We utilize the 
Sphinx 4 Recognition Engine [18] without speaker training to test our language model 
and two general models. A further test is conducted to compare our model with the 
dictation grammar used in the Dragon Naturally Speaking Preferred (version 3.52) 
Engine with speaker training. Table 1 details the test results, which suggest the 
language model specific to the MCCS can significantly outperform a general 
language model or a dictation grammar. 
7   Related Work 
Generating natural language through learning is a relatively new endeavor. Trainable 
methods for surface NLG are introduced in [17] to learn the mapping between 
semantic meaning and syntactic structure so that sophisticated grammars can be 
avoided. The implicative assumption of trainable systems is the existence of a large 
corpus. In our project, we can only create a sample sentence set of a limited size, 
which is not appropriate for training. Our CBR approach differs from trainable 
methods in that instances in the case base are used for adaptation to generate new 
sentences directly, instead of for calculating statistical distribution. [10, 12] introduce 
an approach for instance-based natural language generation. However, instead of 
adapting instances to generate sentences, instances are just used to compare with 
sentences generated by a rule-based system for choosing the final output. No 
adaptation is performed during the generation procedure. [11] presents a surface 
natural language generator in the real estate domain that employs a case-based 
paradigm. Its adaptation-guided retrieval makes it ultimately similar to our system. 
However, our approach differs from it in two respects. Firstly, we employ a 
quantitative distance measurement for acceptance function. Compared with the 
qualitative cost-analysis method used in [11], our method provides a numeric value 
for similarity comparison, which we believe is more straightforward. Secondly, the 
syntactic structure of cases in our system is represented in systemic functional 
formalism while graphical tree structure is utilized in [11] to represent the syntactic, 
lexical, prosodic and acoustic realizations. Our method is simpler and less prone to 
grammatical error in generating structured sentences. 
8   Conclusions 
This paper presents a CBR system to generate a speech corpus for the MCCS 
application. In comparison to traditional NLG approaches, this system overcomes the 
inflexibility of template-based methods while avoiding the linguistic sophistication of 
rule-based packages. Our research indicates that CBR learning techniques can perform 
effectively in generating structured sentences. This approach is particularly useful if 
the size of the sample sentence set is relatively small. The study results also suggest 
that a language model pertaining to a specific application is a necessity as general 
models or dictation grammar cannot satisfy the requirements for recognition accuracy.  
1002 Y. Fan and E. Kendall 
This study is part of research to incorporate natural language understanding 
capacity into a framework to develop speech-enabled mobile commerce applications. 
We only explore natural language models for understanding user specifications or 
queries at the beginning of a conversation in the context of mobile commerce. After 
that, users would be guided by a system-directed dialogue to continue their search for 
desired products. When a user shows interest in a particular product and selects to 
listen to the detailed description of the product, the system will play a pre-recorded 
audio file. We believe speech for product description can be generated through CBR-
based NLG system in a similar manner. A NLG method can provide much more 
flexibility in generating product descriptions in comparison to pre-recorded audio 
files. In future work, the CBR approach introduced in this paper should be able to be 
extended for product description generation.
