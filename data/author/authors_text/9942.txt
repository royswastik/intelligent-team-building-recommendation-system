participation in the CLEF evaluation task and we have considered Bengali, 
Hindi and Telugu as query languages for the retrieval from English 
document collection. We have discussed our Bengali, Hindi and Telugu to 
English CLIR system as part of the ad-hoc bilingual task, English IR system 
for the ad-hoc monolingual task and the associated experiments at CLEF. 
Query construction was manual for Telugu-English ad-hoc bilingual task,
