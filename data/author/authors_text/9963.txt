Abstract 
Terminology development in education, 
science and technology is a key to formu-
lating a knowledge society. The authors 
are developing a multilingual engineering 
terminology dictionary consisting of more 
than ten thousand engineering terms each 
for ten Asian languages and English. The 
dictionary is primarily designed to support 
foreign students who are studying engi-
neering subjects at Japanese higher educa-
tional institutions in the Japanese language. 
Analysis of the lexical terms could provide 
useful knowledge for language resource 
creators. There are two adoption ap-
proaches, ?phonetic adoption? (translitera-
tion of borrowed terms) and ?semantic 
adoption? (where the meaning is expressed 
using native words). The proportion of the 
two options found in the terminology set of 
each country (or language) shows a sub-
stantial difference and seems to reflecti 
language policies of the country and the in-
fluence of foreign languages on the host 
language. This paper presents preliminary 
results of our investigation on this question 
based on a comparative study of three lan-
guages: Japanese, Vietnamese and Thai.  
 
1 Introduction 
1.1 Terminology in Development Context 
For developing countries there is a strong necessity 
to establish an appropriate set of terminology to 
enable local people to learn science and technology 
in an efficient manner throughout their educational 
programs using their mother tongues as the instruc-
tional medium. Instruction in the mother tongue is 
beneficial for students to acquire a basic concept in 
a subject (UNESCO, 2003).  
International communities are fully aware of this 
necessity. The World Summit on the Information 
Society (WSIS) addressed this issue, saying that 
terminology development in education, science and 
culture is a key to developing knowledge societies. 
1.2 Two Approaches to Adopting Terms 
Unlike the situation with basic vocabulary, scien-
tific or technical terms are usually not ?home-
grown?, but are often imported from the outside 
world. And when a scientific or technical term is 
imported from one language (the source language) 
to another language (the host language), typically 
two approaches are found. 
The first approach is to simply borrow a word 
by creating a phonetically equivalent word in the 
host language. For example, the equivalent of the 
The 6th Workshop on Asian Language Resources, 2008
25
English word "science" in Malay is "sains", pro-
nounced as /sains/, and "computer" in Japanese is 
written as "??????" in the Japanese kata-
kana1 syllabary and is pronounced /konpju:ta/ . We 
call this phonetic adoption in this paper. It is quite 
similar to transliteration, but not exactly the same 
due to the difference in phonetic structure between 
the source and host languages. 
The second approach is to create a new word by 
combining a semantically relevant word-root or 
word in the host language. For example, "science" 
in Thai is "???????????", pronounced /w?tthayas?:t/. 
This word is derived from the word "vidya" 
(knowledge) in Sanskrit, a source from which the 
Thai language has imported many words through-
out its history. "Science" in Japanese is "??", 
pronounced /kagaku/. This word was coined more 
than one hundred years ago as a combination of 
two Chinese characters, "?" and "?", meaning "a 
section, or a branch of something" and "learning",  
respectively. As shown in these two cases, it often 
happens that classical languages like Sanskrit or 
Chinese, rather than the host language itself, pro-
vide root-words in this creation process just as 
Latin and Greek roots are used in scientific and 
technical terms in English. We call this approach 
semantic adoption in this paper. 
1.3 Pros and Cons of the Two Approaches 
When we look back on the historical evolution of 
scientific terms dating from ancient civilization to 
modern times, both types of adoption are found. 
Both approaches to adoption have advantages and 
disadvantages in terms of ease of creation and ease 
of understanding, as well as other issues. The pros 
and cons of semantic adoption, summarized in Ta-
ble 1, are in principle the opposites of those of 
phonetic adoption.  
But the choice of adoption approach is not so 
simple. The phonetic adoption option is easy to 
implement, but would have the danger of disturb-
ing language purity, which also has a high priority 
in many nations. When the semantic adoption op-
tion is chosen, language purity is maintained but 
the adoption cost is high and it takes time to pre-
                                                 
1 In Japanese, four scripts are used to write Japanese, e.g. 
kanji (i.e., Chinese characters), hiragana, katakana and 
the Latin alphabet. Katakana script is conventionally 
used to represent foreign phonetically translated words. 
pare a meaningful number of vocabulary items and 
to train teachers in their use.

(1) not easy to find  
connectivity to the

(2) not easy to create
1.4 Third Approach: Use of foreign language 
In addition to this dilemma, a completely different 
approach can be taken when the necessity is very 
urgent. This is to design and to implement the 
whole educational program by means of an estab-
lished foreign language. We call this approach the 
source language approach. In the real world to-
day, this third approach is widely adopted in many 
developing countries, to various extents. The 
choice of foreign language depends on subject do-
mains and the economic and political condition of 
the country as well as on historical ties.  
1.5 Objectives of the study 
In summary, there are three basic options. How-
ever, little research has been carried out on how a 
language community can effectively formulate 
terminology focused on Asian languages. ?Guide-
lines for Terminology Policy? (Infoterm 2005) 
talks about various issues relating to this subject, 
but no mention is found relating to the question of 
adoption strategy. The authors believe that an 
analysis of the existing terminology can provide 
practical and applicable lessons to terminology 
development practitioners and policy makers. This 
paper presents preliminary results of our investiga-
tion on this question, based on a comparative study 
of three countries: Japanese, Vietnamese and Thai.  
2 Dictionary 
In this paper, the main corpus is extracted from a 
multilingual engineering dictionary based on Babel 
(Hayase and Kawata 2002). Babel is a web tech-

To this primary source, we added some terms in 
mathematics and physics and made a multilingual 
database such as that shown in Table 3 by adding

adoptions into 8 languages: Vietnamese, Chinese, 
Korean, Filipino, Malay, Sinhalese, Myanmar and 
Mongolian. The data are coded in Unicode. At pre-
sent Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean and Sinhalese 
language have been translated and other languages 
will be finished soon. The dictionary will be made 
in April, 2008. For this paper, we have selected 
three languages for analysis ? Vietnamese, Thai 
and Japanese ? because these languages have rela-
tively rich vocabularies. 
3 Comparison of Adoption Approaches  
The approach to terminology adoption is examined 
in this section from various angles. 
3.1 Comparison by Country 
In order to investigate the portfolio of two adoption 
approaches, we surveyed the entire lexicon for all 
mechanical engineering subjects. In addition, we 
took a random sampling in our dictionary and 
chose approximately 25 words from two major 
subject fields: architecture and computer science. 
The portfolios of three languages are shown in Ta-
ble 4. Compounds such as hybrids of native and 
loaned word-components were separated from se-
mantic adoption.

Table 4 shows that the Japanese language has 
the highest percentage of phonetically translated 
words from English. Vietnamese has the lowest 
percentage of phonetic adopted words from Eng-
lish, but includes terms from French in mechanical 
engineering plus a few from Russian. Thai shows a 
The 6th Workshop on Asian Language Resources, 2008
27
roughly similar balance between semantic adoption 
and English-origin terms in all three domains.  
The high number of Thai and Vietnamese origin 
words in computer science is rather remarkable, as 
it indicates a consistent effort to adapt the Thai 
language to every emerging technology. Note that 
over half of the computer science terms for Japa-
nese are of English origin. Vietnamese draws on 
different languages to varying degrees; it is notable 
that the languages of origin vary by subject field.  
3.2 Comparison by Subject Domain: A Case of 
Japanese Terms 
As we saw in Table 4, Japanese technical terms are 
often phonetically translated, but less so in archi-
tecture than in the other two fields. To gain a better 
idea of the distribution of phonetic adoption, we 
surveyed the entire Japanese lexicon for all subject 
domains. Table 5 gives the rate of katakana usage, 
that is, the rate of words written in the katakana 
script used for transcribing foreign words. 
 
Table 5. Rate of katakana Usage 
Subject Domain # of terms Katakana Rate 
architecture 1,798 147 0.081
chemistry 958 234 0.244
civil engineering 1,263 156 0.123
telecommunications 1,410 422 0.299
computer science 1,538 650 0.422
control engineering 1,545 497 0.321
electronics 1,200 250 0.208
maritime science 1,403 51 0.036
mathematics 1,284 50 0.038
mechanical engineering 1,186 385 0.324
physics 945 120 0.126
 
The domains of computer science, control engi-
neering and mechanical engineering include over 
30% of katakana words in their terms. In contrast, 
the percentage of katakana terms in architecture, 
mathematics and maritime science domains is less 
than 10%, indicating that these domains are highly 
semantically adopted in their terms, or have little 
need for imported vocabulary. We thus see that 
academic domain affects the adoption of phoneti-
cally translated terms. 
3.3 Mathematical Terms at Different Grade 
Level 
We have collected about 1,300 terms in mathemat-
ics for our multilingual engineering dictionary. 
Following the Japanese course of study3 for grades 
1-12, we chose 57 terms from our dictionary and 
compared those terms with their counterparts in 
Thai and Vietnamese. For university-level mathe-
matical terms, following the syllabus of the 1st year 
of the Faculty of Mathematics in one Japanese 
University, we chose 11 terms4. Then we also sur-
veyed those terms in the same way. Table 6 exam-
ines the terms used in various grade levels.

These data indicate that all languages use either 
original or semantically adopted from elementary 
level to junior-high school level. For Japanese al-
most all words are Sino-Japanese; in oral instruc-
tion native words may be used in Japan but those 
are not used as keywords. As for high school, some 
words phonetically translated from English are 
used in Thai, while at university level all languages 
use English-origin words. As for the rate of Sino-
Vietnamese words in mathematics, it is considera-
bly higher than other categories. This suggests that 
the likelihood that Sino-origin words can be shared

of Mathematical Science in  Doshisya University.

effectively in other countries using Chinese charac-
ters is generally high in the field of mathematics.  
3.4 Web Presence of English Terms and their 
Adopted Equivalents  
We also examined the web presence of pairs of 
terms, an English word and its equivalent in the 
host language. This is an attempt to find how 
widely the source language approach ? direct use 
of foreign language ? is used in technological top-
ics. Four words from different subject domains 
were chosen, and a search was carried out for the 
term (as an exact phrase) using the Google search 
engine (Table 7).

While data are limited to just four terms, general 
trends can be identified. For Japanese pages, while 
there were many hits for English, the hits for Japa-
nese terms were at least three times higher. Inter-
estingly, for operand, the one term with two 
equivalents, the katakana (i.e., phonetically 
adopted) term was used far more frequently than 
the semantically adopted kanji term. In the Viet-
namese pages, while far fewer total hits were made, 
the Vietnamese terms were overwhelmingly more 
frequent than English terms. For Thai pages the 
opposite was found, with the exception of auto-
matic lathe, a tool that may require marketing in 
the local language. These results suggest that the 
major language of technology for Thailand is Eng-
lish, for Vietnam it is the native language, and for 
Japan there is English use but Japanese dominates. 
In order to find if there is a distinction between 
use in technological fields and in general use, we 
made a comparison using three non-technical terms 
(Table 8).

Again, we find that Japanese pages use the 
Japanese word far more frequently (although zoo is 
nearly equal ? perhaps due to the exotic appeal of a 
foreign word, and one understood by almost every 
Japanese) but that English words have a sizable 
presence. For Vietnamese pages, the number of 
hits is substantially higher than that for the techni-
cal terms, but the same trend exists: the native lan-
guage dominates. Finally, for Thai pages, the hits 
for Thai words far exceed those for English words 
in all three cases, although English words are often 
used.  
A comparison of results for Tables 7 and 8 con-
firms that the role of languages differs between 
daily use and situations that require technical ter-
minology, even in a country that has adopted the 
third approach of using a foreign language for sci-
ence and technology. 
4  Social and Academic Factors 
4.1 High Rate of Semantic Adoption in Asian 
Countries 
As can be imagined, it is not easy for Asian people 
to understand technical terms in other Asian lan-
guages, because semantic adoption is popular 
among Asian languages. The diversity of scripts in 
Asia is another reason of this difficulty. In Euro-
pean countries, term-sharing by phonetic adoption 
is easier because almost all languages were derived 
from the same origin and are sharing the same 
script. Therefore, in order to achieve mutual com-
munication using technical terms in Asian coun-
tries, we need to make special efforts to go over 
the variation and harmonize terms each other.  
But we need to discuss why those languages pre-
fer semantic adoption. Various social, political, 
and historical factors influence language use. This 
applies also to the adoption of technical terminol-
ogy. Here, we discuss influences of these factors 
on the approaches used to adopt technical terms, 
including the influence of technical domains and 
academic discipline.  
4.2 Language Policies and Historical Back-
ground 
4.2.1 Vietnam 
In Vietnam, adoption is strongly promoted under 
the strict language policy. The Political Resume of 
the Socialist Republic of Vietnam states that 
?[e]very nationality has the right to use its own 
language and system of writing, to preserve its na-
tional identity, and to promote its fine customs, 
habits, traditions and culture.? Therefore they sel-
dom use phonetically adopted words as such. One 
example of its limited use is ??m? from the English 
?ohm.? Another example is proper nouns, when 
foreign words are used in newspapers This politi-
cal reason is the primary impetus for the semantic 
adoption of terms.  
Secondly, as in other communist nations, Eng-
lish is not taught as an obligatory subject in Viet-
nam. This educational policy also brings about a 
low rate of phonetically adopted words from Eng-
lish, because many people cannot grasp the mean-
ing. 
Thirdly, we need to consider that the Vietnam-
ese language has been historically influenced by 
several foreign languages, as we can induce from 
Table 4?s results. Vietnam was under the influence 
of China for approximately 1,000 years. A number 
of Chinese terms were absorbed into Vietnamese 
as Sino-Vietnamese words. During the French co-
lonial period, the Vietnamese language added 
French words for the manufacture of specific 
products such as automobiles and bicycles. Lastly, 
at the end of the 20th century Russian technical 
terms were introduced by people who had studied 
in or technical advisers who had sent by the Soviet 
Union or in Russia 
4.2.2 Japan 
As is the case with Vietnam, Chinese characters 
and words were imported from China so long ago 
that the characters and words are regarded as part 
of the native Japanese language. In the end of the 
19th century, a number of Japanese-kango (words 
that used Chinese characters but were created by 
Japanese people) were invented as adoptions of 
western technical terms, and many of these terms 
were re-imported to China.  
After World War?, Japan was occupied by the 
Allied Forces led by the United States and English 
became a compulsory subject from junior high 
school. English-origin words became easy to un-
derstand for many Japanese. This historical change 
caused a sharp rise in percentage of phonetic adop-
tions from English among Japanese technical terms 
(see Table 5) (Hashimoto 2007). However, English 
is not usually used as an instructional medium in 
The 6th Workshop on Asian Language Resources, 2008
30
Japanese institutions of higher education. Teachers 
and students know many English loan terms but 
they use these loan terms not as English but as 
Japanese, and since they are pronounced according 
to Japanese phonetic rules, they may not even be 
intelligible to English speakers.  
4.2.2 Thai 
Thai has different features from the other two 
countries in that it is less influenced by Chinese. 
But the Thai language has been influenced by an-
other foreign language, Sanskrit, the classical In-
dian language. We did not examine the rate of San-
skrit origin words in the Thai language in this 
study, but it seems likely that a high rate of terms 
phonetically adopted from Sanskrit will be found 
in our engineering dictionary. Although Thai has 
native-language equivalents at the lexical level, 
English is daily used as an instructional medium in 
higher education. Students in Thailand start to 
learn English at 10 years old or earlier. Thus, even 
though they have native terms they prefer to use 
terms phonetically adopted from English or to use 
English. 
4.3 Other Factors 
4.3.1 When the subject was introduced?  
In the Meiji era (1868-1912) in Japan, experts 
translated technical terms from Western languages 
semantically, into Japanese-kango. Since World 
War II, however, it has been the mainstream to 
transliterate into katakana. Therefore a decisive 
factor in adoption approach is when the subject 
was introduced into Japan. Table 9 shows the 
foundation year for major academic societies and 
institutes in engineering fields, which roughly in-
dicates the time of introduction of the subject. 
As shown in Table 5, computer science is the 
field that uses technical terms in katakana most 
frequently, while the sampled vocabulary from 
telecommunications also includes nearly 30% of 
katakana words. These disciplines are relatively 
newly developed in Japan; the societies or insti-
tutes related to these fields were established in the 
latter half of the 20th century.  
The oldest societies, the Mathematical Society 
of Japan and The Physical Society of Japan, were 
established in 1877; our study showed that only 
3.8% of mathematical terms and 12.6% of terms in 
physics are phonetically adopted terms. Therefore, 
disciplines with academic societies established 
relatively early may have developed a great deal of 
their terminology during the Meiji era, and may 
still have a preference for Japanese-kango over 
katakana. Newer disciplines, on the other hand, 
may have found it easier to use the imported terms 
in a relatively direct way.

4.3.2. Is it indigenous? 
Each country has specific characteristics of the 
region, such as regional climate, folk, culture, life-
style and other indigenous factors. Technical terms 
in these fields are therefore strongly connected 
with regional characteristics. Before unfamiliar 
terms or new technologies were brought over to the 
host country, experts in those fields had already 
created and used their own technical terms in their 
native language, and also they were already aware 
of the concept of a thing indicated by an unfamiliar 
term in alien language. All they had to do was to 
make a one-to-one correspondence and correctly 
translate a foreign term into the term that was al-
ready in use in the mother tongue.

5 Conclusion 
This preliminary study looks at the different ap-
proaches to adopting technical terms in three Asian 
languages. The three languages investigated prefer 
different methods: Vietnamese tends to adopt 
words into its language semantically, through 
adoption, while Japanese adopts them phonetically, 
through transliteration. Thai, to a large extent, has 
chosen a third approach, that of using a source lan-
guage (English). 
In Japanese and in Vietnamese, many terms sub-
ject to semantic adoption were translated into Chi-
nese characters. This suggests that Sino-words may 
be an effective way of communicating concepts 
among certain language users in certain disciplines, 
such as mathematics. 
The effect of grade level was also investigated, 
and it was found that native language terms were 
used in mathematics almost exclusively until high 
school or university level. 
Subject domain was found to have an effect on 
the adoption approach and was often influenced by 
whether the domain had a long tradition, and when 
established a discipline was (as shown by the 
foundation of academic societies). A domain effect 
was seen in Vietnamese, where Russian or French-
origin terms appeared in different domains. 
While quite limited in scope, this study has re-
vealed clear trends that deserve further investiga-
tion.  
6 Future Research  
We plan to investigate more fully the rate of pho-
netically translated words and approach to termi-
nology adoption. We expect that Chinese and Ko-
rean will give us further evidence of widespread 
use of Sino-words and Mongolian will provide 
data for phonetic adoption from Russian. Malay 
and Filipino are likely to be highly influenced by 
English, while we will find the influence of San-
skrit in Myanmar and Sinhalese.
