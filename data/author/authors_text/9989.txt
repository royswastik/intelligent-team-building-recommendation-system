Abstract 
 
Our participation in CLEF 2007 consisted of two Cross-lingual and one 
monolingual text retrieval in the Ad-hoc bilingual track. The cross-language 
task includes the retrieval of English documents in response to queries in 
two Indian languages, Hindi and Bengali. The Hindi and Bengali queries 
were first processed using a morphological analyzer (Bengali), a stemmer 
(Hindi) and a set of 200 Hindi and 273 Bengali stop words. The refined 
hindi queries were then looked into the Hindi-English bilingual lexicon, 
?Shabdanjali? (approx. 26K Hindi words) and all of the corresponding 
translations were considered for the equivalent English query generation, if a 
match was found. Rest of the query words were transliterated using the 
ITRANS scheme. For the Bengali query, we had to depend mostly on the 
translietrations due to the lack of any effective Bengali-English bilingual 
lexicon. The final equivalent English query was then fed into the Lucene 
Search engine for the monolingual retrieval of the English documents. The 
CLEF evaluations suggested the need for a rich bilingual lexicon, a good 
Named Entity Recognizer and a better transliterator for CLIR involving 
Indian languages. The best MAP values for Bengali and Hindi CLIR for our 
experiment were 7.26 and 4.77 which are 0.20 and 0.13 of our monolingual 
retrieval, respectively.
